<sup>1</sup> And in that day there was read in the volume of Moy­ses the people hearing it: and there was found writ­ten in it, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not en­ter into the Church of God for euer: † for that they mette not <sup>2</sup> the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hyred against them Balaam, to curse them: and our God turned the cursing into blessing. † And it came to passe, when they had <sup>3</sup> heard the law, they separated euerie stranger from Israel. † <sup>4</sup> And ouer this thing was Eliasib the Priest, who had bene made ouerseer in the treasurie of the house of our God, and was neere akinne to Tobias. † He therefore made to himself a <sup>5</sup> great treasurie, and they were there before him laying vp giftes, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tythe of corne, of wine, and of oyle, the portions of the Leuites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the first fruites of the Priestes. † But in al these things I was not in Ierusalem, be- <sup>6</sup> cause in the two and thirteth yeare of Artaxerxes the king of Babylon I came to the king, and in the end of certaine dayes I desired the king. † And I came to Ierusalem, and I <sup>7</sup> vnderstood the euil, that Eliasib had done to Tobias, to make him a treasure in the entrances of the house of God. † And it <sup>8</sup> semed to me exceding euil. And I threw forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the treasurie: † and I comman- <sup>9</sup> ded and they clensed the treasuries: and I brought thither againe the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense. † And I knew that the portion of the Leuites <sup>10</sup> had not bene geuen: and that euerie man was fled into his countrie of the Leuites, and the singing men, and of them that ministred: † and I pleaded the matter against the magi- <sup>11</sup>
