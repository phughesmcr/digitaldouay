Thus much concerning particular pointes of faith and religion. And it is no lesse euident, that the vniuersal Church and Citie of God stil conti-nued: yea was more visible, and conspicuous to the whole world then before. First by Gods maruelous protection therof in the desert, and famous victories and conquestes of the land of Chanaan. And by the excellent lawes geuen to this people; which al nations admired, and none had the like. Deut. 4. For in this fourth age, besides other lawes and preceptes, the spiritual and temporal states were more distinguished, and the Ecclesiastical Hierarchie especially disposed in subordination of one supreme head, with inferior gouer-ners, ech in their place and office, for edification of the whole bodie. For Moyses being chief ruler and conductor of the Israelites out of Ã†gypt, receiued and deliuered to them the written Law (Exod. 20.) And for obseruation and conseruation therof by Gods expresse appointment (Leuit. 8.) consecrated Aaron the ordinarie High priest, himself remayning stil extraordinarie Superiour, also aboue Aaron. And after Aaron he consecrated in like maner his sonne Eleazar high priest, and successour to his father (Num. 20.) To whom succeded others in this order (1. Paralip. 6.) Phinees, Abisue, Bocci, Ozi, Zacharias, (otherwise 1. Reg. 1. called Heli) Mereioth, Amarias (otherwise Achimelec, whom Saul slew, 1. Reg. 22.) Achitob (otherwise Abiathar, who was deposed, 3. Reg. 2.) and Sadoc, in whose time the Temple was founded.

To these were adioyned other Priestes, also consecrated in a prescript forme (Leuit. 8.) and Leuites ordayned to assist in lower and distinct offi-ces (Num. 3. & 4.) In the first degree the Caathites; whose office was to carrie the Sanctuarie, and vessels therof wrapped vp by the priestes, but were forbid in paine of death, to touch them, or to see them. In the second degree the Gersonites; who carried the cortines and couers of the Tabernacle, and vessel of the Altar. In the third degree the Merarites; who carried the bardes, barres, and pillers, with their feete, pinnes, cordes, and other imple-mentes of the tabernacle; euerie one according to their office and bur-dens, Num. 4. v. vlt.

But in the temporal state and gouernment Iosue of the tribe of Ephra-im succeeded to Moyses (Num. 27. Deut. 3. & 34.) And after Iosue were diuers interruptions of succession, with gouernors of diuers tribes, and change of gouernment, from Dukes to Iudges, and from Iudges to Kinges. For after Iosues death the people being sore afflicted by inuasions of Infidels, God raised certaine special men, with title of Iudges to deliuer and saue them. First Othoniel of the tribe of Iuda; then Aod of Beniamin; after him Samgar (the Scripture not signifying of what tribe:) then Barach with Debora of Ephraim; Gedeon of Manasses; Abimelech, his base sonne, an vsurper; Thola of Issachar; Iair, and Iephte of Manasses;
