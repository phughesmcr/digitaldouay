And Saul and al the Israelites hea- ring such wordes of the Philistian were astonied, and feared <sup>12</sup> excedingly. And there was Dauid the sonne of a man that was an Ephrathcite, of whom there was mention before, of Bethlehem Iuda, whose name was Isai, who had eight sonnes, and he was in the dayes of Saul an old man, and aged among <sup>13</sup> men. And his three elder sonnes went after Saul into battel: and the names of his three sonnes, which went to battel, were Eliab the first begotten, and the second Abina- <sup>14</sup> dab, the third also Samma: and Dauid was the yongest. <sup>15</sup> The three elder therefore hauing folowed Saul, Dauid went, and returned from Saul, to feede his fathers flocke in <sup>16</sup> Bethlehem.

And al the Israelites when they had sene the man, fled from his <sup>25</sup> face, fearing him excedingly.
