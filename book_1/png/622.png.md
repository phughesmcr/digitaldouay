which he had brought from Amalec. <sup>13</sup>And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul sayd to him: Blessed be thou to our Lord, I haue fulfilled the word of our Lord. <sup>14</sup>And Samuel sayd: And what is this voice of flockes, which soundeth in myne eares, and of heardes, which I heare? <sup>15</sup>And Saul said: They haue brought them from Amalec: for the people hath spared the better sheepe and heardes that they might be immolated to our Lord thy God, but the rest we haue slaine. <sup>16</sup>And Samuel said to Saul: Suffer me, and I wil shew thee what our Lord hath spoken to me this night. And he sayd to him: Speake. <sup>17</sup>And Samuel said: When thou wast a litle one in thyne owne eyes, wast thou not made chief in the tribes of Israel? And our Lord annointed thee to be king ouer Israel, <sup>18</sup>and our Lord sent thee on the way, and sayd: Goe, and kil the sinners of Amalec, and thou shalt fight against them vntil the vtter destruction of them. <sup>19</sup>Why therefore hast thou not heard the voice of our Lord: but art turned to the praye, and hast done euil in the eies of our Lord? <sup>20</sup>And Saul said to Samuel: Yea I haue heard the voice of our Lord, and haue walked in the way by which our Lord sent me, and haue brought Agag the king of Amalec, and Amalec I haue slaine. <sup>21</sup>But the people tooke of the praye sheepe and oxen, the principal of those thinges which were slaine, to immolate to our Lord their God in Galgal. <sup>22</sup>And Samuel said: Why wil our Lord haue holocaustes and victimes, and not rather that the voice of our Lord be obeyed? For BETTER is obedience then victimes: and to harken rather then to offer the fatte of rammes. <sup>23</sup>Because it is as it were the sinne of inchantment, to resist: and as it were the wickednes of idolatrie, to refuse to obey: For as much therefore as thou hast reiected the word of our Lord, our Lord hath reiected thee that thou shalt not be king. <sup>24</sup>And Saul said to Samuel: I haue sinned, because I haue transgressed the saying of our Lord, and thy wordes, fearing the people, and obeying their voice. <sup>25</sup>But now beare I beseech thee my sinne, and returne with me, that I may adore our Lord. <sup>26</sup>And Samuel sayd to Saul: I wil not returne with thee, because thou hast reiected the word of our Lord, and our Lord hath reiected thee that thou shalt not be king ouer Israel, <sup>27</sup>And Samuel turned him selfe to depart: but he caught the hemme of his cloke, which also did rent. <sup>28</sup>And Samuel said to him: Our Lord hath rent the kingdom
