Salomon.

OF KINGES. 703

<sup>2</sup>The Lord said to me: Thou art my Sonne, I this day haue begotten thee. <sup>109</sup>The Lord said to my Lord: *It is is*, God the Father to God the Sonne: *who according to his diuinitie is the Lord of Dauid, according to his humanitie the sonne of Dauid. The same king Dauid maketh mention also of the third Person*, the Holie Ghost, pray-<sup>50</sup>Thy holie Spirit take not from me. *In the forme of blessing the people* <sup>6</sup>*al three Persons seme to be vnderstood in the name of our Lord thrise repeted*; our Lord (the Father) blesse thee and keepe thee. Our Lord (the sonne) shew his face to thee, and haue mercie vpon thee. Our Lord (the Holie Ghost) turne his countenance vnto thee, and geue thee peace.

*Of the Incarnation of the sonne of God, we haue in this age manie pro-phecies and figures. Moyses euidently* <sup>18</sup>*foretelleth that after other prophets Christ the Sonne of God should come in flesh, and redeme man-kind, as S. Peter teacheth* <sup>3</sup>*Likewise in his Canticle, and Blessing of the tribes* <sup>32</sup>*he speaketh more expresly of Christ and his Church, then of the Iewes and their Synagogue. The starre prophecied by Ba-laam* <sup>24</sup>*foreshewed both to Iewes and Gentiles, that Christ should subdue al nations. Iosue both in name and office was a manifest figure of IESVS Christ, Also the Iudges, and Kinges, some in one thing, some in an other, most especially king Dauid and king Salomon, were figures of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. The brasen serpent* <sup>21</sup>*signified Christ to be crucified, as him selfe expoundeth it* <sup>3</sup>*Briefly the whole Law was a pedagogue, or conductor to bring men to Christ* <sup>3</sup>*and by him to know God and them selues: to wit, God omnipotent, al perfect, Creator of al, our Father, Redemer, and Sanctifier: and man his chief earthlie creature; capable of himselfe weake and impotent, yet through sinne miserable, yet in nature of free condition, indued with vnderstanding, to conceiue, and discerne; and with freewil, to choose or refuse what liketh or displeaseht him.*

For God appointing al creatures their offices, ingraffed in al other thinges inuariable inclination to performe the same, so that they could neither by vertue nor sinne make their state better nor worse then it was created, but ordaining Angels and men to a higher end of eternal felicitie, left their wil free to agree vnto, or to resist his preceptes, and counsels. Wherupon Angels cooperating with Gods grace were confirmed in glorie, and some resisting were eternally damned. Man also offending fel into damnable state, but through penance may be saued, if he cooperate with new grace of our Redemer, which is in his choice to doe, or omitte. As when God gaue his people manna in the desert <sup>16</sup>he so instructed them, how to receiue it and vse it, without sette or compulsion, that he might proue them (as himselfe speaketh)
