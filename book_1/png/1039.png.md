thinges, al the people fel on their face, adoring our Lord, and
with common lamentation and weeping they powred out
<sup>15</sup> their prayers with one accord to our Lord, saying: Lord
God of heauen and earth, behold their pride, and haue re-
gard to our humilitie, and attend the face of thy sainctes,
and shew that thou forsakest not them that presume of thee
and, that thou humblest them that presume of them selues,
<sup>16</sup> and glorie of their power. Their weeping therfore being
ended, & the peoples prayer by the whole day being finished,

whose power thou hast set forth, he wil geue thee this recom-
<sup>18</sup> pence, that thou rather shalt see their destruction. And
when the Lord our God shal geue this libertie to his seruan-
tes, be God with thee also in the middes of vs: that as it shal
please thee, so thou with al thine mayst conuerse with vs.
<sup>19</sup> Then Ozias, the counsel being ended, receiued him into
<sup>20</sup> his house, and made him a greate supper. And al the anci-
entes being called, they refreshed them selues together after
<sup>21</sup> the fasting was ended. But afterwarde al the people was
called together, and al the night long within the church, they
prayed desiring helpe of the God of Israel.
