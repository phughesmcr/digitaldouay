<sup>1</sup>THEREFORE the men of Caria Thiarim came, and brought backe the arke of our Lord, and caried it into the house of Abinadab in Gabaa: And Eleazar his sonne they sanctified, that he might keepe the arke of our Lord. <sup>2</sup>And it came to passe, from the day that the arke of our Lord abode in Caria Thiarim the dayes were multiplied (for it was now the twentith yeare) and al the house of Israel rested after our Lord. <sup>3</sup>And Samuel spake to al the house of Israel, saying: If you turne to our Lord in al your hart, take away the strange goddes out of the middes of you, Baalim, and Astaroth: and prepare your hartes to our Lord, and serue him only, and he wil deliuer you from the hand of the Philisthijms. <sup>4</sup>Therefore the children of Israel tooke away Baalim and Astaroth, and serued our Lord only. <sup>5</sup>And Samuel sayd: Gather together al Israel into Masphath, that I may pray our Lord for you. <sup>6</sup>And they assembled into Masphath: and they drew water, and powred it out in the sight of our Lord, and they fasted that day, and sayd there: We haue sinned to our Lord. And Samuel iudged the children of Israel in Masphath. <sup>7</sup>And the Philisthijms heard that the children of Israel were gathered together into Masphath, and the princes of the Philisthijms went vp to Israel. Which when the children of Israel had heard, they were afrayde at the face of the Philisthijms. <sup>8</sup>And they said to Samuel: cease not to crie to our Lord God for vs, that he saue vs from the hand of the Philisthims. <sup>9</sup>And Samuel tooke one sucking lambe, and offered it a whole holocauste to our Lord: and Samuel cried to our Lord for Israel, and our Lord heard him. <sup>10</sup>And it came to passe, when Samuel offered the holocauste, the Philisthijms beganne battel against Israel: but our Lord thundered with a great noise in that day vpon the Philisthijms, and terrified them, and they were slaine before the face of Israel. <sup>11</sup>And the men
