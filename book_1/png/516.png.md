<sup>1</sup> of Israel gave to them: dividing al thinges by lotte, as our Lord had commanded in the hand of Moyses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe. <sup>2</sup> For to two tribes and a half Moyses had geven possession beyond Iordan: besides the Levites, which received no land among their brethren: <sup>3</sup> but into their place succeded the children of Ioseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive other portion in the Land, but cities to inhabite, and their suburbes to feede their beastes and cattel. <sup>4</sup> As our Lord had commanded Moyses, so did the children of Israel, and they divided the Land. <sup>5</sup> Therefore the children of Iuda came to Iosue in Galgal, and Caleb the sonne of Iephone the Cenezeite spake to him: Thou knowest what our Lord spake to Moyses the man of God concerning me & thee in Cadesbarne. <sup>6</sup> Fourtie yeares old was I when Moyses the servant of our Lord sent me from Cadesbarne, to view the Land, and I reported to him that which to me semed true. <sup>7</sup> But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the hart of the people: and I nevertheles folowed our Lord my God. <sup>8</sup> And Moyses sware in that day, saying: The Land, which thy foote hath troden, shal be thy possession, and thy childrens for ever, because thou hast folowed our Lord my God. <sup>9</sup> Our Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until this present day. It is fourtie and five yeares, since our Lord spake this worde to Moyses, when Israel walked through the wildernes: this day am I eightie and five yeares old <sup>10</sup> so lustie, as I was at that time when I was sent to view: the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as wel to fight as to goe. <sup>11</sup> Geve me therefore this mountaine, which our Lord promised, thy selfe also hearing it, wherein are the Enacims, and great cities and fensed: if perhaps our Lord be with me, and I shal be able to destroy them, as he promised me. <sup>12</sup> And Iosue blessed him, and delivered to him Hebron in possession <sup>13</sup> And from thence forth Hebron belonged to Caleb the sonne of Iephone the Cenezeite, until this present day: because he folowed our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>14</sup> The name of Hebron before was called Cariath Arbe: Adam the greatest among the Enacims was layd there: and the Land ceased from battels.
