# Gedeon.

## IVDGES. CHAP. VI.

The people falling againe to sinne, are oppressed by the Madianites. 12. An Angel appearing to Gedeon, sendeth him to deliuer Israel, 17. confirming his mission by miracle. 25. So he first destroyeth Baals altar: 34. then gathe­reth an armie against Idolaters: 36. and is assured againe of Gods prote­ction by two miracles in a fleece of woolle.

1. AND the children of Israel did euil in the sight of our Lord: who deliuered them into the hand of Madian seuen yeares, <sup>2</sup> & they were sore oppressed of them. And they made them selues dennes and caues in the mountaines, and very wel sensed places to resist. <sup>3</sup> And when Israel had sowen, Madian came vp and Amalec, and the rest of the East nations: <sup>4</sup> and pitching their tentes by them wasted al thin­ges as they were in the blade vnto the entring of Gaza: and they left nothing at al in Israel that perteyned to mans life, not sheepe, not oxen, not asses. <sup>5</sup> For they and al their flockes came with their tabernacles, and like vnto locustes filled al places, an innumerable multitude of men, and of camels, wa­sting whatsoeuer they touched. <sup>6</sup> And Israel was sore hum­bled in the sight of Madian. <sup>7</sup> And he cried to our Lord de­siring helpe against the Madianites. <sup>8</sup> Who sent vnto them a man that was a prophet, and he spake: Thus sayeth our Lord the God of Israel: I made you to come vp out of Ægypt, <sup>9</sup> and brought you out of the house of seruitude, and deli­uered you out of the handes of the Ægyptians, and of al the enemies, that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your en­tring, and deliuered you their Land. <sup>10</sup> And I said: I the Lord your God, feare not the goddes of the Amorrheites, in whose land you dwel. And you would not heare my voice. <sup>11</sup> And an Angel of our Lord came, and sate vnder an oke, which was in Ephra, and perteyned to Ioas the father of the familie of Ezri. And when Gedeon his sonne did thresh and purge <sup>12</sup> wheate in a winepresse, to flee Madian, the Angel of our Lord appeared to him, and said: Our Lord be with thee ô most valiant of men. <sup>13</sup> And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee my Lord, if our Lord be with vs, why haue these euils apprehended vs? where are his meruelous workes, which our fathers haue told vs, and said: Out of Ægypt did our Lord bring vs? but now our Lord hath forsaken vs, and deliuered <sup>14</sup> vs into the hande of Madian. And our Lord looked
