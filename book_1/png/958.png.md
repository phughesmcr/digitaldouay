twentie yeares, his sonne Ela reigning but two yeares, was slaine by his ser-
uant Zambri, and al his kinred destroyd. Which Zambri reigned but seuen
dayes. For being forthwith besieged by Amri, of the tribe of Beniamin, he
desperatly burned him self together with the kinges palace. Neither did Amri
then possesse the kingdome with peace. For he being chosen king by the armie
only, whereof he was general, an other part of the people chose & folowed
Thebni. Wherof arose ciuil warre betwen the Antikinges, continuing
three yeares: til Thebni died, and so Amri reigned alone, but wickedly as his
predecessors, twelue yeares in al. Then succeeded his sonne Achab most wicked.
Who maried Iezabel a Sydonian, & by her was perswaded to worshippe
Baal. 3. Reg. 16. To him notwithstanding God sent manie admonitions by
sundrie Prophetes, and bestowed great benefites vpon him, wherupon he did
some notorious penitential workes; but not perseuring in anie good thing, re-
turned to his wickednes. 3. Rg. 20. And finally beleiuing false prophetes,
and persecuting Micheas for prophecying the truth, was slaine in battel when
he thought him self most secure. 3. Reg. 22. Hauing reigned twentie two yeares.
3. Reg. 16. His sonne: Ochozias reigning but two yeares fel through a win-
dow, and died of the hurt. 4. Reg. 1. His other sonne Ioram, after twelue
yeares was slaine by Iehu of an other familie: who then dissipathid Iezabel,
and leauing her in the streete, the dogges did eate her carkasse. He also caused
seuentie sonnes of Ioram to be slaine, and vtterly destroyed al Achahs house. 4.
Reg. 10. For which seruice he was established in the kingdome, for foure gene-
rations. v. 30. So him selfe reigning twentie eight yeares, 3. Reg. 10. After him
reigned successiuely his sonne Ioachaz seuentene yeares, his sonne Ioas, six-
tene yeares. 4. Reg. 13. his sonne Ieroboam one and fourtie yeares. Lastlie
his sonne Zacharias, whom his seruant Sellum of an other race, killed
when he had reigned but six monethes. 4. Reg. 15. And after one moneth
Sellum was slaine by Manahen of an other progenie. Who reigned tenne
yeares. Then his sonne Phaceia reigning two yeares, was slaine by Phacee
of an other generation. He reigning twentie yeares, manie of his people were
carried captiue into Assiria, and him selfe was slaine by Osee of an other
kindred. 4. Reg. 15. Finallie the Assirians taking Samaria by three yeares
siege, in the ninth yeare of Osee possessed the kingdome of Israel, and
led al the principal persons captiues into Assiria: about two hundred
fourtie two yeares after that Ieroboam first reigned ouer the Ten Tribes. Thus
there were in al nineteene kinges. Besides Thebni, who onlie reigned
in part against an other. Of which the first Ieroboam, and Iehu were aduan-
ced by Gods ordinance, for punishment of others. Amri was chosen by the
armie, the rest of the people chosing Thebni. Six inuaded by mere force, killing
their predecessors. The rest succeeded, by such titles as their fathers had. And
though some were better some worse then others, al were wicked, and at last
ouerthrowen.
