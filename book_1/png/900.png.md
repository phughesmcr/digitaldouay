in good thinges. â€  Lord God turne not away from the face

CHAP. VII.

*Fire from heauen deuoureth the holocaustes, and glorie replenisheth the
Temple. 5. More sacrifices are offered, 8. and the Temple is dedicated, with
seuen daies solemnitie, the eight day collection is made. 12. God signifieth
that he hath heard Salomons prayer. 17. conditionally (as it was made)
if they serue him, 19. otherwise he wil punish them.*

<sup>1</sup>AND when Salomon had finished to poure out his
prayers, fyre descended from heauen, and deuoured the
holocaustes and victimes: and the maiestie of our Lord filled
the house. <sup>2</sup>Neither could the Priestes enter into the
Temple of our Lord, because the maiestie of our Lord had
filled the temple of our Lord. <sup>3</sup>Yea and al the children of
Israel sawe the fyre descending, and the glorie of our Lord
vpon the house: and falling flat on the earth vpon the paue-

<sup>8</sup>Salomon therefore made a solemnitie at that time seuen
daies, and al Israel with him, an assemblie verie great, from
the entrance of Emath to the Torrent of Aegypt. <sup>9</sup>And he
made in the eight day an assemblie, because he had dedicated
the altar seuen daies, and had celebrated the solemnitie seuen
daies. <sup>10</sup>Therfore in the three and twenteth day of the se-
uenth moneth, he dismist the people to their tabernacles,

[^1]: As the Temple was the special place of prayer, chosen by God: vs. 12. So special Hymnes Psalmes and other set formes of blessing are more grateful to God, and more effectual to his seruantes.
