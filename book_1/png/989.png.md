them that built on the wal, and that carried burdens, and that
laded them: with one of his hands he did the worke, & with
the other he held a sword: <sup>18</sup> for euery one of the builders
was girded with a sword about his reynes. And they builded,
and sounded with the trumpet nere me. <sup>19</sup> And I sayd to the
princes, and to the magistrates, & to the rest of the common
people: The worke is great and broad, and we are sepe-
rated in the wal one far from an other: <sup>20</sup> in what place soeuer
you shal heare the sound of the trumpet, thither runne toge-
ther vnto vs: our God wil fight for vs. <sup>21</sup> And let vs our selues
doe the worke: and let the halfe part of vs hold speares from
the rysing of the morning, til the starres appeare. <sup>22</sup> At that
time also I sayd to the people: Let euery man with his seruant
tarry in the middes of Ierusalem, and let there be courses
among vs by day and night to worke. <sup>23</sup> And I and my bre-
theren, and my seruants, and the watchmen, that were be-
hinde me, did not put of our clothes: euery man was made
bare only to washing.

liue: <sup>3</sup> And there were that sayd: Let vs pledge our fieldes,
and vineyardes, and our houses, and let vs take corne in fa-
mine. <sup>4</sup> And others sayd: Let vs borow money for the kings
tributes, and let vs giue our fields and vineyardes, <sup>5</sup> and now
as the flesh of our bretheren, so is our flesh: and as their chil-
dren so also our children. behold we subdew our sonnes, and
our daughters into bondage, and our daughters there are
bondwemen, neither haue we wherewith they may be rede-
med, and our fieldes and our vineyardes other men doe pos-
sesse. <sup>6</sup> And I was exceeding angrie, when I had heard their crie
according to these wordes. <sup>7</sup> And my hart thought with my
selfe: and I rebuked the princes and magistrates, and sayd to
them: Do you euery one exact vsuries of your brethren? and
I gathered against them a great assemblie, <sup>8</sup> and I sayd to
