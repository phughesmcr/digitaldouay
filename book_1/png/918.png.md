And they compassed him fighting: but he cried to our Lord, and he holpe him, and turned them away from him. <sup>32</sup>For when the captaynes of the horsemen saw, that is was not the king of Israel, they least him. <sup>33</sup>And it chanced that one of the people shot an arrow at aduenture, and stroke the king of Israel betwen the necke and the shoulders, and he sayd to his cocher: Turne thy hand, and carie me out of the battel, because I am wounded. <sup>34</sup>And the fight was ended in that day: moreouer the king of Israel stood in his chariote agaynst the Syrians vntil euening, and died at the sunne sette.
