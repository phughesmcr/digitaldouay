# Of Iob, Chap. XVII.

For the greuousnes of his paine iob expresseth spedie death, 4. chargeth his frendes with follie for holding only remuneration in this life. 6. himself he putteth happie rest in the other World.

<sup>1</sup>My spirit shal be extenuated, my daies shal be shortened, and the graue only remaineth for me. <sup>2</sup>I haue not sinned, and mine eie abideth in bitterness. <sup>3</sup>Deliuer me, and set me beside thee, and let anie mans hand fight against me. <sup>4</sup>Thou hast made their hart far from discipline, and therfore they shal not be exalted. <sup>5</sup>He promiseth a praye to his fellowes, and the eies of his children shal faile. <sup>6</sup>He hath set me as it were for a prouerbe of the comon people, and I am an example before them. <sup>7</sup>Mine eie is dimme for indignation, and my members are brought as it were to nothing. <sup>8</sup>The iust shal be astonied vpon this, and the innocent shal be raised vp against the hypocrite. <sup>9</sup>And the iust shal hold his way, and with cleane handes shal adde strength. <sup>10</sup>Be al you therfore conuerted, and come, and I shal not finde among you anie wiseman. <sup>11</sup>My daies haue passed, my cogitations are dissipated, tormenting my hart. <sup>12</sup>Night they haue turned into day, and againe after darkenesse I hope for light. <sup>13</sup>If I shal expect, hel is my house, and in darkenesse I haue made my bed. <sup>14</sup>I haue sayd to rottenes: Thou art my father, my mother, and my sister, to wormes. <sup>15</sup>Where is now then my expectation, and my patience who conside- reth? <sup>16</sup>Al my thinges shal descend into most deepe hel: there at the least, shal I haue rest thinkest thou?

Baldad setteth vpon Iob againe, chargeing him with present impatience, and former impietie, 6. and that therfore he suffereth worthie punish- ment.

<sup>1</sup>But Baldad the Suhite answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup>How long wil ye speake vaunting wordes? vnderstand ye first, and so let vs speake. <sup>3</sup>Why are we reputed as beastes, and accoun- ted vile before you? <sup>4</sup>Which destroyest thy soule in thy furie, shal the earth be forsaken for thee, and shal rockes be trans- ported out of their place? <sup>5</sup>Shal not the light of the impious be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine? <sup>6</sup>The light shal be darke in his tabernacle, and the candel that is
