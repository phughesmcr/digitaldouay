Maasia, Celita, Azarias, Iozabed, Hanan, Phalaia: Leuites made silence in the people to heare the law: and the people stoode in their degree. <sup>8</sup> And they read in the booke of the law of God distinctly and playnly, for to vnderstand: and they vnderstood when it was read. <sup>9</sup> And Nehemias said (the same is:: Athersatha)and Esdras the Priest and scribe, and the Leuites interpreting to al the people: It is a day sanctified to the Lord our God, mourne ye not, and weepe not. For al the people wept, when they heard the wordes of the law. <sup>10</sup> And he said to them: Goe, eate fat thinges, and drinck the sweete wine, and send portions to them, that haue not prepared for them selues: because it is the holie day of our Lord, and be not sadde: for the ioy of our Lord is our strength. <sup>11</sup> And the Leuites made silence in al the people, saying: Hold your peace, because the day is holie, and be not sorowful. <sup>12</sup> Therefore al the people went to eate and drinck, and to send portions, and to make great ioy: because they vnderstood the wordes, that he had taught them. <sup>13</sup> And in the second day were gathered the princes of the families of al the people, the Priests and Leuites to Esdras the scribe, that he should interpret vnto them the wordes of the law. <sup>14</sup> And they found written in the law, that our Lord commanded in the hand of Moyses, that the children of Israel should dwel in tabernacles, on the solemne day, the seuenth moneth: <sup>15</sup> and that they should proclame and publish a voice in al their cities, and in Ierusalem, saying: Goe ye forth into the mount, and fetch branches of the oliue tree, and branches of the most fayre tree, branches of the mirtle tree, and boughes of the palme trees, and branches of the thicke leaued tree, that tabernacles may be made, as it is written. <sup>16</sup> And the people went forth, and brought. And they made them selues tabernacles euery man in his house toppe, and in his courtes, and in the courtes of the house of God, and in the streate of the water gate, and in the streate of the gate of Ephraim <sup>17</sup> Therefore al the church of them, that were returned from the captiuitie, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles. For from the daies of Iosue the sonne of Nun the children of Israel had not done it in such sort, vntil that day: and there was exceeding great ioy. <sup>18</sup> And he reade in the booke of the law of God day by day, from the first day til the last, and they made the solemnitie seuen dayes, & in the eight day a collect according to the rite.
