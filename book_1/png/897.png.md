## Chap. VI.

Salomon blesseth the people. 4. prayeth to God, geuing thankes for benefites receiued, 16. and requesting continual protection, and that God wil heare the prayers of the people, 32. yea also of strangers that pray in the Temple.

<sup>1</sup>Then Salomon sayd: Our Lord promised that he would dwel in darkenesse: <sup>2</sup>and I haue built a house to his name, that he might dwel there for euer. <sup>3</sup>And the king turned his face, and blessed al the multitude of Israel (for al the multitude stood attent) and sayd: <sup>4</sup>Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel, who in worke hath accomplished that, which he spake to Dauid my father, saying: <sup>5</sup>From the day, that I brought my people out of the Land of Aegypt, I chose not a citie of al the tribes of Israel, that a house might be built in it to my name: neither did I choose anie other man, to be Duke in my people Israel. <sup>6</sup>but I chose Ierusalem, that my name may be in it: and I chose Dauid, that I might appoynt him ouer my people Israel. <sup>7</sup>And wheras Dauid my father had meant to build a house to the name of our Lord the God of Israel, <sup>8</sup>our Lord sayd to him: Because thy wil was this, that thou wouldest build a house to my name, thou hast done wel certes to haue such a wil: <sup>9</sup>howbeit thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne, which shal come out of thy loynes, he shal build a house to my name. <sup>10</sup>Our Lord therfore hath accomplished his word, which he spake: and I am risen for Dauid my father, and sit vpon the throne of Israel, as our Lord hath spoken: and haue built a house to the name of our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>11</sup>And I haue put in it the Arke, wherin is the couenant of our Lord, which he made with the children of Israel: <sup>12</sup>He therfore stoode before the Altar of our Lord, ouer agaynst al the multitude of Israel, and stretched forth his handes. <sup>13</sup>For Salomon had made an eminent place of brasse, and had put it in the middes of the Temple, hauing fiue cubites of length, & bredth, & three of height: & he stoode vpon it: & afterward kneeling ouer agaynst al the multitude of Israel, and his handes lifted vp toward heauen, <sup>14</sup>he sayd: Lord God of Israel, there is not the like God to thee in heauen and in earth: which keepest couenant and mercie with thy seruantes, that walke before thee in al their hart: <sup>15</sup>which hast performed to thy seruant Dauid my father what thinges soeuer thou hadst spoken to him: and the thinges that by mouth
