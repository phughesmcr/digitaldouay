<sup>4</sup>perhaps to him, that hath not wisdom, and thy prudence hast thou shewed very great. Whom wouldst thou teach? not him that made breath? <sup>5</sup>Behold the gyantes grone vnder the waters, and they that dwel with them. <sup>6</sup>Hel is naked before him, and there is no couert to perdition. <sup>7</sup>Who stretcheth out the Northwind ouer the vacant, and hangeth the earth vpon nothing. <sup>8</sup>Who bindeth the waters in his cloudes, that they breake not forth together downward. <sup>9</sup>Who holdeth the countenance of his throne, and spreddeth his clowds ouer it. <sup>10</sup>He hath set a limite about the waters, til light & darkenes be ended. <sup>11</sup>The pillers of heauen tremble, and dread at his beck. <sup>12</sup>In his strength sodenly the seas are gathered together, and with his wisdom he stroke the proud man. <sup>13</sup>His spirit hath adorned the heauens, and his hand being the midwife, the winding serpent is brought forth. <sup>14</sup>Loe, these things are sayd in part of his waies: and where as we haue heard scarce a litle droppe of his word, who shal be able to behold the thunder of his greatnes?

CHAP. XXVII.

*More and more Iob confirmeth his innocencie, auouching that God not presently iudging, 11. wil in time condemne the wicked.*

<sup>1</sup>Iob also added, taking his parable, and sayd: <sup>2</sup>God liueth, who hath taken away my iudgement, and the Omnipotent, which hath brought my soule to bitternesse. <sup>3</sup>That as long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nosthrils; <sup>4</sup>My lippes shal not speake iniquitie, neither shal my tongue meditate lying. <sup>5</sup>God forbid that I should iudge you to be iust: til I faile, I wil not departe from mine innocencie. <sup>6</sup>My iustification which I haue begune to hold, I wil not forsake: for my hart doth not reprehend me in al my life. <sup>7</sup>Let mine enemie be as the impious, and mine aduersarie as the wicked one. <sup>8</sup>For what is the hypocrites hope if couetousely he take by violence, and God deliuer not his soule? <sup>9</sup>Wil God heare his crie, when distresse shal come vpon him? <sup>10</sup>Or can he be delighted in the Omnipotent, and inuocate God at al time? <sup>11</sup>I wil teach you by the hand of God, what the Omnipotent hath, neither wil I hide it. <sup>12</sup>Loe, you doe al knowe, and why speake you vaine thinges without cause. <sup>13</sup>This is the portion of an impious man with God, and inheritance of the violent, which they shal receiue of the Omnipotent.

<aside>Neither is Baldads prudence able to helpe if there were neede:</aside>

<aside>Giantes were not able to wade in Noes floud, but were drowned with the rest.</aside>

<aside>Not only great thinges before recited but also the very least are made by God, and depend vpon his prouidence.</aside>

<aside>God would not as yet haue Iobs cause iudged, but reserued the sentence, for his greater trial in patience.</aside>

<aside>It were a lie to acknowlege such sinnes as he had not committed.</aside>
