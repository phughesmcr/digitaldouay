him in the sepulchre of his father in Bethlehem: and Ioab,
and the men that were with him, walked al the night, and
in the very twilight they came into Hebron.

CHAP. III.

*Isboseths forces daily decay, Dauid increaseth in powre, and hath manie
sonnes. 7. Abner vpon occasion of a slander breaketh from Isboseth, and
serueth Dauid, bringing Michel to him, and much people of Israel. 23.
Ioab of emulation and reuenge killeth Abner. 28. for which Dauid is
offended with Ioab, 31. and mourneth for Abner.*

<sup>1</sup> THERE was made therefore long strife betwen the
house of Saul, and betwen the house of Dauid: Dauid
prospering and alwaies stronger then himself, but the house
<sup>2</sup> of Saul decreasing daily. † And there were sonnes borne to
Dauid in Hebron: and his first begotten was Amnon of Achi-
<sup>3</sup> noam the Iezrahelite. † And after him Cheleab of Abigail
the wife of Nabal of Carmel: moreouer the third Absalom
the sonne of Maacha the daughter of Tolmai king of Gessur.
<sup>4</sup> † And the fourth Adonias, the sonne of Haggith: and the
<sup>5</sup> fifth Saphathia, the sonne of Abital. † The sixt also Iethra-
am of Egla the wife of Dauid. these were borne to Dauid in
<sup>6</sup> Hebron. † Therefore when there was battel betwen the house
of Saul and house of Dauid, Abner the sonne of Ner ruled the
<sup>7</sup> house of Saul. † And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the
<sup>8</sup> daughter of Aia. And Isboseth said to Abner: † Why diddest
thou go in to my fathers concubine? Who being wrath excee-
dingly for the wordes of Isboseth, said: What am I a dogges
head against Iuda this day, which haue done mercie vpon the
house of Saul thy father, and vpon his brethren and neerest
freinds, & haue not deliuered thee into the hands of Dauid, &
hast thou sought against me that thou mightest charge me for
<sup>9</sup> a woman to day? † These things do God to Abner, and these
things adde he to him, vnlesse as our Lord hath sworne to
<sup>10</sup> Dauid, so I doe truth to him. † That the kingdom be trans-
<sup>11</sup> ferred from the house of Saul, and the throne of Dauid be
exalted ouer Israel, and ouer Iuda, from Dan to Bersabee.
<sup>12</sup> † And he could not answer him any thing, because he feared
him. Abner therefore sent messengers to Dauid for himself
saying: Whose is the land? And that they should say: Make
amitie with me, & my hand shal be with thee: and I wil reduce
<sup>13</sup> vnto thee al Israel. † Who said: Very wel: I wil make amitie

<aside>:: Am I contemptible in thy sight, and yet head of them that oppose against Dauid, I that haue donne so much for thee, wil not indure to be reprehended, for a smal fault. So God suffereth the maintainers of an euil quarel to fal out among themselues.</aside>
