may be short in the edge of the sword, which is made longer
in the drought of thirst. <sup>18</sup> And when they had said these thin-
ges, there was made great weeping and howling of al in the
assemblie, and for manie houres with one voice they cried to
God, saying: <sup>19</sup> We haue sinned with our fathers, we haue
done vniustly, we haue committed iniquitie. <sup>20</sup> Thou because
thou art gracious, haue mercie vpon vs, or in thy scourge
reuenge our iniquities, and deliuer not them that trust in thee
to a people, that knoweth not thee, <sup>21</sup> that they say not among
the Gentiles: Where is their God? <sup>22</sup> And when they wearied
with these cries, and tyred with these weepings, had held
their peace, <sup>23</sup> Ozias rysing vp embrued with teares, said: Be
of good chere bretheren, and these fiue daies let vs expect
mercie of our Lord. <sup>24</sup> For peraduenture he wil cut of his in-
dignation, and wil geue glorie to his name. <sup>25</sup> But if after fiue
daies be past there come no aide, we wil doe these wordes,
which you haue spoken.

chias, the sonne of Enan, the sonne of Nathanias, the sonne
of Salathiel, the sonne of Simeon, the sonne of Israel: <sup>2</sup> and
her husband was Manasses, who died in the daies of barley
