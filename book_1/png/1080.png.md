# The argument of Iob.

to good and bad in this life, and that the true reward of the iust, and punish-
ment of the wicked, is to be expected in the other world. At last God, with
due reprehension of Iob for some imperfections, sharply rebuketh the errors,
and insolence of his adverse freindes; geveth sentence on Iobs side; pardoneth
them at his intercession; and restoreth al thinges to him duble, to that he had
before.

[^1] Besides the literal sense Iob in al his actions, sufferinges, and whole life, was
a special figure of Christ, shewing (sayth S. Gregorie) by those
thinges which he did and suffeined, what our Redemer should
do and suffer: yea more particularly than most part of the Patriarches. Which
S. Ierome (epist. ad Paulin.) also admireth and testifieth, saying: what
mysteries of Christ doth not this booke comprehend? Euerie word
is ful of sense. Moreouer this historie is replenished with moral docu-
mentes, how to embrace virtue, and eschew vice: proposing the life of a
right godlie man, neither insolent in prosperitie, nor desparing in aduer-
sitie, alwayes constant in Gods seruice, as wel in his prosperous kingdom
as in the miserable dunghill.

[^2] Here also we haue the true maner of arguing,
according to the rules of Logike, with detection of sophistrie, Iob prouing
and disprouing assertions by proposition, assumption, and con-
clusion, as S. Ierome obserueth, with profound knowledge of natural thinges
and causes, as appeareth in verie manie places. And which varietie and abun-
dance of matter, comprised in smal roome, make manie thinges hard and
obscure, yet are the same so tempered with other thinges plaine and easie,
that here is verified S. Augustins obseruation (li. 2. c. 6. doct. Christ.) certaine
places of holie Scriptures serue as delectabl meate to them that
hunger and thirst diuine knowlege, and the obscure take away
tediousnes from them, that loath vsual plaine doctrin.

[^3] It is most probable that Iob himself, inspired by the Holie Ghost, by whose
grace he excelled al in right simplicitie (c. 1.) writte his owne historie; the
most part in verse, only the two first chapters and the last in prose, in the Ara-
bian tongue, which Moyses translated into Hebrew, for the consolation of the
Israelites afflicted in Ã†gypt.

And it may be diuided into three general partes. First the change of Iobs
state from prosperitie into affliction, with his lamentation for the same, are
recorded in the three first chapters. In foure and thirtie chapters folowing are
sundrie disputations, conflictes, and discourses betwen him and his freindes,
touching the cause of his so vehement affliction. In the fiue last chapters God
discusseth the quarel, geueth sentence for Iob against his aduersaries, pardo-
neth them, and rewardeth him.
