<sup>4</sup> Because we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore we are delivered in spoile, and captivitie, and death, and into a fable, and into reproch to al nations, in which thou hast dispersed vs. <sup>5</sup> And now Lord great are thy judgements, because we have not done according to thy preceptes, & have not walked sincerely before thee: <sup>6</sup> and now Lord according to thy wil do with me, & command my spirite to be received in peace: for it is expedient for me to die, rather then to live. <sup>7</sup> The verie same day therfore it chanced that Sara the daughter of Raguel in Rages a citie of the Medes, she also heard reproch of one of her fathers handmaydes, <sup>8</sup> because she had beene delivered to seven husbandes, & the divel named Asmodeus had killed them, forthwith as they were entred in vnto her. <sup>9</sup> Therfore when she rebuked the wench for her fault, she answered her, saying: Let vs no more see sonne of thee, or daughter vpon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbandes. <sup>10</sup> What wilt thou kil me also, as thou hast now killed seven husbandes? At this voice she went into an higher chamber of her house: and three dayes, and three nightes did not eate, nor drinke: <sup>11</sup> but continewing in prayer with teares besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproch. <sup>12</sup> And it came to passe the third day, whiles she accomplished her prayer, blessing our Lord, <sup>13</sup> she sayd: Blessed is thy name ô God of our fathers: who when thou hast bene angrie, wilt doe mercie, & in the time of tribulation forgevest them their sinnes, that invocate thee. <sup>14</sup> To thee ô Lord I turne my face, to thee I direct myne eyes. <sup>15</sup> I desire Lord that thou loose me from the bond of this reproch, or els take me away from the earth. <sup>16</sup> Thou knowest Lord that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soule cleane from al concupiscence. <sup>17</sup> Never have I companied my self with sporters: neither have I made my selfe partaker with them that walke in lightnesse. <sup>18</sup> But a husband I consented to take, with thy feare, not with my lust. <sup>19</sup> And either I was vnworthie of them, or they perhaps were not worthie for me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man. <sup>20</sup> For thy counsel is not in mans power. <sup>21</sup> But this hath everie one for certayne, that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be in probation, shal be crowned: and if it be in tribulation, it shal be delivered: and if it be in correction, it shal be lawful to come to thy mercie. <sup>22</sup> For thou art not delighted in our perditions: because after
