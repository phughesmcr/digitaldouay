and your children shal turne away, not folowing me, nor
keeping my commandements, and my ceremonies, which
I haue proposed to you, but shal goe and worshippe strange
goddes, and adore them: <sup>7</sup> I wil take away Israel from the
face of the land, which I haue geuen them, and the temple
which I haue sanctified to my name, I wil cast away from my
sight, and Israel shal be for a prouerbe, and for a fable to al
peoples. <sup>8</sup> And this house shal be for an example: euerie one
that shal passe by it, shal wonder, and hisse, and say: Why
hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?
<sup>9</sup> And they shal answere: Because they haue forsaken the
Lord their God, which brought their fathers out of the Land
of Ægypt, and haue folowed strange goddes, & adored them,
and worshipped them: therfore hath the Lord brought vpon
them al this euil. <sup>10</sup> And twentie yeares being complete, after
that Salomon had built the two houses, that is, the house
of our Lord, and the house of the king <sup>11</sup> (Hiram the king of
Tyre ministering to Salomon cedar trees, and firre trees, and gold
according to al that he had neede) then Salomon gaue to
Hiram twentie townes in the Land of Galilee. <sup>12</sup> And Hiram
went from Tyre, to see the townes which Salomon had geuen
him, and they pleased him not, <sup>13</sup> and he sayd: Are these the
cities, which thou hast geuen me, brother? And he called them
the land *Chabul, vntil this day. <sup>14</sup> Hiram also sent to king
Salomon an hundred and twentie talentes of gold. <sup>15</sup> This is
the summe of the expences, which king Salomon offered to
build the house of our Lord, and his owne house, and Mello,
and the wal of Ierusalem, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer
<sup>16</sup> Pharao the king of Ægypt came vp and tooke Gazer, and
burnt it with fire: And the Chananite, that dwelt in the citie,
he slewe, and gaue it for a dowrie to his daughter the wife
of Salomon. <sup>17</sup> Salomon therfore built Gazer, and Bethhoron
the lower, <sup>18</sup> and Baalath, and Palmira in the Land of the wil-
dernes. <sup>19</sup> And al the villages, that perteyned to him, and were
without wal, he fensed, and the cities of the chariotes, and
the cities of the horsemen, and whatsoeuer pleased him to
build in Ierusalem, and in Libanus, and in al the land of his
dominion. <sup>20</sup> Al the people, that was remayning of the Amor-
rheites, and Hetheites, and Pherezeites, and Heueites, and
Iebusites, that are not of the children of Israel: <sup>21</sup> their chil-
dren, that were remayning in the land, to witte, those whom

<aside>Salomon did not sel these cities, for he could not alie- nate them, but let the king of Tyre haue the vse and reue- newes in pay- ment for tim- ber, & for the gold which he sent.</aside>
