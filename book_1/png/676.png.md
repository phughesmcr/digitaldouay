Our Lord also stroke the child, which the wife of Vrias had borne to Dauid, and he was past hope. <sup>16</sup> And Dauid besought our Lord for the child: and Dauid fasted a fast, and going in aside, lay vpon the ground. <sup>17</sup> And the ancientes of his house came, being earnest with him, that he would rise from the ground: who would not, neither did he eate meate with them. <sup>18</sup> And it chanced the seuenth day
