unto her seven cordes, as he had said: with the which she

bound him, <sup>9</sup> ambushementes lying secretely in wayte neere
her, and in the chamber expecting the end of the thing, and
she cried to him: The Philisthijms vpon thee Samson. Who
brake the bandes, as if a man should breake a thread of toe
twyned with spittle, when it hath taken the sauor of fyre:
and it was not knowen wherein his strength was. <sup>10</sup> And
Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast deluded me, and hast
spoken false: now at the least tel me wherewith thou mayest
be bound. <sup>11</sup> To whom he answered: If I shal be bound with
new cordes, that were neuer occupied, I shal be weake, and
like to other men. <sup>12</sup> With the which Dalila againe bound
him, and cried: The Philisthijmes vpon thee Samson, ambu-
shementes being prepared in the chamber. Who did so breake
the bandes as threades of linnen cloth. <sup>13</sup> And Dalila said to
him againe: How long deceiuest thou me, and speakest false?
Shew wherewith thou mayest be bound. To whom Samson
answered: If thou platte seuen heares of my head with a
heare lase, and fasten a nayle tyed round about them in the

she said to him: The Philisthijms vpon thee Samson. Who
rysing vp from sleepe drew out the nayle with the heares and
the heare lase. <sup>15</sup> And Dalila said to him: How doest thou say
that thou louest me, whereas thy mind is not with me? These
three times thou hast lied to me, & wouldest not tel wherein
thy greatest strength is. <sup>16</sup> And when she molested him, and
continually hong vpon him for many daies, not geuing him
space to rest, his soule faynted, and was wearied euen vnto
death. <sup>17</sup> Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her:
There neuer came yron vpon my head, because I am a Naza-
reite, that is to say, consecrated to God from my mothers
wombe: if my head shal be shauen, :: my strength shal de-
part from me, and I shal fayle, and shal be as other men.
<sup>18</sup> And she seing that he had confessed to her al his minde,
sent to the princes of the Philisthijms and willed them: Come
vp yet once more, for now he hath opened his hart to me.
Who went vp taking with them the money which they had
promised. <sup>19</sup> But she made him to sleepe vpon her knees, and
to lay his head in her bosome. And she called a barber, and
shaued his seuen heares, and beganne to driue him away, and
thrust him from her: for immediately the strength departed
