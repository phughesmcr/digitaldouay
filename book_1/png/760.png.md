THIRD BOOKE of Iuda Abias. Asa.

<sup>1</sup>THERFORE in the eighteenth yeare of king Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, Abias reigned ouer Iuda. <sup>2</sup>Three yeares reigned he in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Maacha the daughter of Abessalom. <sup>3</sup>And he walked in al the sinnes of his father, which he had done before him: neither was his hart perfect with our Lord his God, as the hart of Dauid his father. <sup>4</sup>But for Dauids sake our Lord his God gaue him a lampe in Ierusalem, that he might rayse vp his sonne after him, and establish Ierusalem: <sup>5</sup>because Dauid had done right in the eies of our Lord, and had not declined from al thinges, which he commanded him, al the daies of his life, except the matter of Vrias the Hetheite. <sup>6</sup>But there was warre betwen Roboam and Ieroboam al the time of his life. <sup>7</sup>And the rest of the wordes of Abias, and al that he did, are they not written in the Booke of the wordes of the kinges of Iuda? And there was warre betwen Abias and Ieroboam. <sup>8</sup>And Abias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the citie of Dauid: and Asa his sonne reigned for him.

<sup>9</sup>In the twenteth yeare therfore of Ieroboam the king of Israel reigned Asa the king of Iuda: <sup>10</sup>And he reigned one & fourtie yeares in Ierusalem. His mothers name was Maaca, the daughter of Abessalom. <sup>11</sup>And Asa did right before the sight of our Lord, as Dauid his father: <sup>12</sup>and he tooke away the effeminate out of the land, and he purged al the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made. <sup>13</sup>Moreouer he remoued also Maaca his mother, that she should not be princesse in the sacrifices of Priapus, and in the groue which she had consecrated: and he destroyed her denne, and brake the most filthie idol, and burnt it in the torrent cedron: <sup>14</sup>but the excelses he did not take away. Otherwise the hart of Asa was perfect with our Lord al his daies: <sup>15</sup>and he caried in those thinges, which his father had sanctified, and vowed into the house of our Lord, siluer and gold, and vessels. <sup>16</sup>And there was warre betwen Asa, and Baasa the king of Israel al their daies. <sup>17</sup>Baasa also the king of Israel went vp into Iuda, and built Rama, that no man might go out or come in of Asas side
