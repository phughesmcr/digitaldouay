# Of Tobias.

## Annotations.

### Chap. XII.

<sup>12</sup> I offered thy prayer to our Lord. Here the Angel Raphael reporteth certain good offices, which he had done for Tobias. He did other like for his sonne, and for Raguel, and his daughter, which are likewise recorded in this booke. And the whole world, especially Gods servants, receive continual great benefites by holie Angels, as partly may be gathered in this holie historie, and more elsewhere. For first the office of Angels is, to assist, or be always readie, as most diligent servitours of God, expecting what his divine goodnes wil appoint them, whither to goe, and what to doe for the benefite of men: as holie Raphael was sent, when yong Tobias wanted a guide. Secondly, Angels offer the prayers of the faithful, or as the Greeke text readeth, *they present the prayers of Sainctes, that is, of godlie men and women to God*: so Raphael testifieth here him self, that he offered Tobias prayers to our Lord. Thirdly, Angels ayde and assist those that love puritie of life, sincere service of God, hate vice, embrace vertue, & do workes of mercie; so Raphael assisted Tobias, when he traveled to burie the dead, fleing from the kings furie, and hiding himself, ch. 1. v. 11. 13. Fourthly Angels exhort to good workes, as in this 12. chapter, v. 6. 8. 9. 10. 18. Fiftly they suggest and instruct what to do, ch. 6. v. 4. 5. Raphael taught yong Tobias to take the fish, vnbowel him, reserve partes thereof, v. 11. 12. 13 advised him to lodge at Raguels house, to demand Sara to wife, and v. 16. 17. instructed him, against whom diuels have power. Sixtly, they expel diuels from persons, and places, ch. 8. v. 3. Raphael tooke and bound the diuel *Asmodeus* in the desert of higher Egypt. Seventhly, they deliver men from dangers and eviles, c. 6. v. 3. as when the great fish assaulted Tobias, and Sara from molestation, and slaunder, and old Tobias from blindnes, chap. 3. v. 10. ch. 11. v. 8. ch. 12. v. 13. Eightly, When it redoundeth to the honour and more service of God, and good of the soule, Angels procure riches, and worldly commodities, ch. 12. v. 3. Yong Tobias gratfully confessed the great benefites received by his guide, concluding generally, *by him we are replenished* (sayth he) *with al good thinges*. Ninthly, Good Angels also prove men, for their more merite, so this Angel witnesseth ch. 12. v. 13. *Because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessarie, that tentation should prove thee*. Tenthly, and finally (for we remitte the reader to larger documentes of others) after proofe of patiences, fortitude, and other vertues, holie Angels comforte good men; so Raphael encouraged old Tobias, saying, ch. 5. v. 13. his blindenes should shortly be cured, ch. 12. v. 12. shewed him how grateful his prayers with teares and workes of mercie were in Gods sight. He comforted Raguel and his familie by bringing yong Tobias to their house, ch. 7. v. 5. Much more, ch. 8. v. 16. both them and al Tobias his familie, by driving away the diuel; and lastly by revealing himselfe vnto them. So holie Angels, especially the proper gardian patrones of everie one, are alwayes readie to helpe men; guard them, exhort them to good, do instruct them, do expel evil spirites, and deliver men from many evils & dangers, do procure them temporal commodities, prove their vertues, offer their prayers and good workes, assist them al their lives, and at their deathes, then also bring their soules to the Iudgement seate, and (if they die in good state) to eternal ioy and glorie, wherof the ancient fathers writings are ful.
