wil be with thee: he wil not leaue, nor forsake thee: feare
not, neither dread thou. <sup>9</sup> Moyses therefore wrote this law,
and deliuered it to the priestes the sonnes of Leui, which
caried the arke of the couenant of our Lord, and to al the
ancientes of Israel. <sup>10</sup> And he commanded them saying: After
seuen yeares, in the yeare of remission, in the solemnitie of
tabernacles, <sup>11</sup> when al come together out of Israel, to ap-
peare in the sight of our Lord thy God in the place, which
our Lord shal choose, thou shalt read the wordes of this law
before al Israel, they hearing, <sup>12</sup> and the people being assem-
bled together, as wel men as wemen, children, and strangers,
that are within thy gates: that hearing they may learne, and
feare our Lord your God, and keepe, and fulfil al the wordes
of this law. <sup>13</sup> Their children also who now are ignorant: that
they may heare, and feare our Lord their God, al the daies that
they liue in the Land, which passing ouer Iordan you goe to
obteyne. <sup>14</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Behold the daies of

there wil they forsake me, and wil make the couenant, which
I haue made with them, of none effect. <sup>17</sup> And my furie shal
be wrath against them in that day: and I wil forsake them,
and wil hide my face from them, and they shal be deuou-

shal say in that day: In truth because God is not with me,
these euils haue found me. <sup>18</sup> But I wil hide, and keepe close
my face in that day, for al the euils, which they haue done,
because they haue folowed strange goddes. <sup>19</sup> Now therefore
write vnto you this canticle, and teach the children of Is-
rael: that they know it by hart, and sing it by mouth, and
this song be vnto me for a testimonie among the children
