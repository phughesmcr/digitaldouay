& the name of the place was called: The field of the valientes, in Gabaon. <sup>17</sup>And there rose a very sore battel in that day: and Abner was put to flight, & the men of Israel, by the seruantes of Dauid. <sup>18</sup>And there were there the three sonnes of Saruia, Ioab, and Abisai, and Asael: moreouer Asael was a most swift runner, as it were one of the roes, that abide in the wooddes. <sup>19</sup>And Asael pursued Abner, and declined not to the right hand nor to the left omitting to pursue Abner. <sup>20</sup>Abner therefore looked backe behind him, and said: Art thou Asael? Who answered: I am. <sup>21</sup>And Abner said to him: Goe to the right hand, or to the left, and apprehend one of the young men, and take to thee his spoyles. But Asael would not leaue but vrged him: <sup>22</sup>And againe Abner said to Asael: Retyre, and do not folowe me, lest I be compelled to sticke thee to the ground, and I shal not be able to lift vp my face to Ioab thy brother. <sup>23</sup>Who contemned to heare, and would not goe aside: Abner therefore stroke him, with his speare turned backe in the priuy partes, and thrust him through, and he dyed in the same place: and al that passed by that place, where in Asael fel and dyed, did stay. <sup>24</sup>But whiles Ioab and Abisai pursued Abner fleeing, the sunne went downe: and they came as farre as the hil of the water conduit, that is ouer against the valley the way of the desert in Gabaon. <sup>25</sup>And the children of Beniamin were assembled together to Abner: and being gathered in a plumpe, into one troupe, they stoode in the toppe of one hil. <sup>26</sup>And Abner cryed out to Ioab, and said: Shal thy sword rage vnto vtter destruction? knowest thou not that desperation is dangerous? how long differest thou to say to the people, that they leaue to pursue their brethren? <sup>27</sup>And Ioab said: Our Lord liueth, if thou hadest spoken, in the morning had the people retyred, from pursuing their brethren. <sup>28</sup>Ioab therefore sounded the trumpette, and al the armie stood, neither did they pursue Israel any further, nor enter into fight. <sup>29</sup>And Abner and his men went through the champaine country, al that night: and they passed Iordan, and hauing viewed al Beth horon, came to the campe. <sup>30</sup>Moreouer Ioab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled al the people: and there wanted of Dauids seruantes ninetene men, beside Asael. <sup>31</sup>But the seruantes of Dauid stroke of Beniamin, and of the men, that were with Abner three hundred three score, who also died. <sup>32</sup>And they tooke Asael, & buried him in
