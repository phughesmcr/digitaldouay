# THE BOOKE

supreme Guard of Gods Church, Christes Vicar in earth, for satisfaction of
others which haue nede, and are in the communion of Sainctes, and performe
the conditions appointed. And so this high Guard may in due maner by his
authoritie, geue limited, or plenarie pardones to penitentes, of the paines
which otherwise they should suffer in this life, or in purgatorie, for their sinnes first remitted. Other Bishops can also geue or dispence so much as the Supreme Bishop allotteth to their powre, also edification and necessitie of Gods
seruantes, as dispensers, not dissipatores of so holie treasure.

## CHAP. VII.

*Iob explicateth diuers calamities of mans life, and namely of his owne. 6. Supposing it not likelie that he shal returne to former prosperous state, 15. desireth to dye.*

<sup>1</sup>The life of man vpon earth is a warfare, & his daies, as the daies of an hyred man. <sup>2</sup>As a seruant desireth the shadow, & as the hired man taryeth for the end of his worke: <sup>3</sup>So I also haue had vayne monethes, and haue numbred to my self laborious nightes. <sup>4</sup>If I sleepe, I shal say: When shal I arise? and agayne I shal expect the euening, and shal be replenished with sorowes euen vntil darkenenes. <sup>5</sup>My flesh is clothed with rottenesse and filth of dust, my skinne is withered, & drawen together. <sup>6</sup>My daies haue passed more swiftly, then the webbe is cut of the weauer, and are consumed without anie hope. <sup>7</sup>Remember that my life is a winde, and myne eie shal not returne to see good thinges. <sup>8</sup>Neither shal the sight of man behold me: thine eies vpon me, and I shal not stand. <sup>9</sup>As a clowde is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shal descend to hel shal not ascend. <sup>10</sup>Neither shal he returne anie more into his house, neither shal his place know him anie more. <sup>11</sup>Wherfore I also wil not spare my mouth, I wil speake in the tribulation of my spirit: I wil talke with the bitternesse of my soule. <sup>12</sup>Why, am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast compassed me with a prison. <sup>13</sup>If I say: My litle bed shal comfort me, and I shal be releeued speaking with myself in my couch: <sup>14</sup>Thou wilt terrisse me by dreames, and by visions shake me with horrour. <sup>15</sup>For the which thing my soule hath chosen hanging, and my bones death. <sup>16</sup>I haue despayred, I shal liue no longer: spare me, for my daies are nothing. <sup>17</sup>What is man that thou magnifiest him? or why settest thou thy hart toward him? <sup>18</sup>Thou doest visite him early, and sodenly thou prouest him: <sup>19</sup>How long doest thou not spare me, nor suffer me that I swallow my spitle? <sup>20</sup>I haue sinned, what shal I doe to thee Ã´ keeper of men?
