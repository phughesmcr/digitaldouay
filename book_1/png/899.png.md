enemies, wasting the countries, shal besiege the gates of the
cities, and al plague and infirmitie shal presse them: <sup>29</sup> if any of
thy people Israel shal pray, knowing their plague and infirmitie, and shal spred forth their handes in this house, <sup>30</sup> thou
shalt heare from heauen, to wit, out of thy high habitation,
and be thou propitious, and render to euerie one according
to his wayes, which thou knowest him to haue in his hart: (for
thou onlie knowest the hartes of the children of men:) <sup>31</sup> that
they may feare thee, and walke in thy waies al the daies, that
they liue vpon the face of the land, which thou hast geuen to
our fathers. <sup>32</sup> The Forener also, which is not of thy people Israel, if he come from a far countrie, for thy strong hand, & thy
streched out arme, and adore in this place: <sup>33</sup> thou shalt heare
from heauen thy most firme habitation, & shalt do al thinges,
for the which that pilgrime shal inuocate thee: that al the
peoples of the earth may know thy name, and may feare thee,
as thy people Israel, and may know, that thy name is inuocated vpon this house, which I haue built. <sup>34</sup> If thy people shal

they leade them captiue into a farre countrie, or which is

land, to the which they were led captiue, shal doe penance,
and shal beseech thee in the land of their captiuitie, saying: We
haue sinned, we haue done wickedly, we haue delt vniustly:
<sup>38</sup> and shal returne to thee in al their hart, and in al their soule,
in the land of their captiuitie, to the which they were led,
shal adore thee agaynst the way of their land, which thou
