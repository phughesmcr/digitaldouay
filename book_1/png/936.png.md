THERFORE Ezechias began to reigne, when he was fiue and twentie yeares old, and he reigned nine and twentie yeares in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias. <sup>2</sup> And he did that which was pleasing in the sight of our Lord, according to al thinges that Dauid his father had done. <sup>3</sup> He in the first yeare and moneth of his reigne opened the doores of the house of our Lord, and repayred them. <sup>4</sup> And he brought the Priestes and the Leuites, and assembled them in the East streate. <sup>5</sup> And he sayd to them: Heare me ye Leuites, and be sanctified, cleanse the house of our Lord the God of your fathers, and take away al vncleannnes out of the Sanctuarie. <sup>6</sup> Our fathers haue sinned and done euil in the sight of our Lord God, forsaking him: they haue turned away their faces from the tabernacle of our Lord, and geuen the backe. <sup>7</sup> They haue shut the doores, that were in the porch, and put out the lampes, and haue not burnt incense, and haue not offered holocaustes in the Sanctuarie of the God of Israel. <sup>8</sup> Therefore was the furie of our Lord stirred vp vpon Iuda and Ierusalem, and he hath deliuered them into commotion, and into destruction, & to be hissed at, as your selues see with your eyes. <sup>9</sup> Behold, our fathers haue fallen by the swordes, our sonnes, and our daughters, and wiues are led captiue for this wickednesse. <sup>10</sup> Now therfore it pleaseth me that we make a couenant with our Lord the God of Israel, and he wil turne away the furie of his wrath from vs. <sup>11</sup> My children be not negligent: our Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, and to minister to him, and to worship him, and to burne incense to him. <sup>12</sup> The Leuites therfore arose: Mahath the sonne of Amasai, and Ioel the sonne of Azarias, of the children of Caath: moreouer the children of Merari, Cis the sonne of Abdi, and Azarias the sonne of Ialaleel. And of the children of Gerson, Ioah the sonne of Zemma, and Eden the sonne of Ioah. <sup>13</sup> But of the children of Elisaphan, Samri, and Iahiel. Also of the children of Asaph, Zacharias, and Mathanias. <sup>14</sup> Moreouer
