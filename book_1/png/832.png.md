Let him alone, let no man moue his bones. And his bones
remayned vntouched with the bones of the prophet, that
came out of Samaria. <sup>19</sup> Moreouer al the temples of the ex-
celses, which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kinges
of Israel had made to prouoke our Lord, Iosias tooke away:
and he did to them according to al the workes, which he had
done in Bethel. <sup>20</sup> And he slew al the priestes of the excelses,
that were there vpon the altars: and he burnt mens bones
vpon them: & turned into Ierusalem. <sup>21</sup> And he commanded
al the people, saying: Make a Phase to our Lord your God,
according as it is writen in the booke of this couenant. <sup>22</sup> For
there was not such a Phase made from the daies of the
Iudges, which iudged Israel, and of al the daies of the kinges
of Israel, and of the kinges of Iuda, <sup>23</sup> as in the eightenth
yeare of King Iosias this Phase was made to our Lord in Ieru-
salem. <sup>24</sup> Yea and the Pythones, and Southsayers, and the
images of idols, and the filthes, and the abominations, that
had bene in the land of Iuda and Ierusalem, Iosias tooke away:
that he might establish the wordes of the law, that were
writen in the Booke, which Helcias the priest found in the
temple of our Lord. <sup>25</sup> There was no king before him like to
him, that returned to our Lord in al his hart, & in al his soule,
and in al his powre according to al the law of Moyses: neither
after him did there arise the like to him. <sup>26</sup> But yet our Lord
was not auerted from the wrath of his great furie, wherwith
his furie was wrath agaynst Iuda: for the prouocations, wher-
with Manasses had prouoked him. <sup>27</sup> Our Lord therfore
sayd Iuda also wil I take away from my face, as I haue taken
away Israel: and I wil reiect this citie, which I chose Ieru-
salem, and the house, wherof I sayd: My name shal be there.
<sup>28</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Iosias, and al that he did, are
not these thinges writen in the Booke of the wordes of the
daies of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>29</sup> In his dayes came vp Pharao
Nechao the king of Ã†gypt, agaynst the king of Assyrians to
the riuer Euphrates: and Iosias the king went to meete him:
and was slaine in Mageddo, when he had seene him. <sup>30</sup> And
his seruantes caried him dead from Mageddo: & they brought
him into Ierusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre. And the
people of the land tooke Ioachaz the sonne of Iosias: and they
anoynted him, and made him king for his father. <sup>31</sup> Three and
twentie yeares old was Ioachaz when he began to reigne, and
