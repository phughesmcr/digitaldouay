that the infant died: and the seruantes of Dauid feared to tel
him, that the child was dead. For they sayd: Behold when
the child yet liued, we spake to him, and he heard not our
voice: how much more if we shal say: The child is dead, wil
he afflict him self? <sup>19</sup> When Dauid therfore sawe his seruantes
muttering, he vnderstood that the infant was dead: and he
sayd to his seruantes: Is the child dead? Who answered him:
He is dead. <sup>20</sup> Dauid therfore rose from the ground; and was
washed and annoynted: and when he had changed his gar-
ment, he entered into the house of our Lord: and adored, and
came into his owne house, and he called for bread, and he did
eate. <sup>21</sup> And his seruantes sayd vnto him: What thing is this,
that thou hast done? for the infant, when he yet liued, thou
didst fast and weepe: but the child being dead, thou didst rise
vp, and hast eaten bread. <sup>22</sup> Who sayd: For the infant, whiles
he yet liued, I fasted and wept: for I sayd: Who knoweth if
perhaps our Lord wil geue him to me, and the infant may
liue? <sup>23</sup> But now because he is dead, why do I fast? Shal I be
able to cal him againe any more? I shal go to him rather: but
he shal not returne to me. <sup>24</sup> And Dauid comforted Bethsabee
his wife; and going in vnto her, slept with her: who bare a
sonne, and he called his name Salomon, and our Lord loued
him. <sup>25</sup> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophete,
and called his name, Amiable to our Lord, because our Lord
loued him. <sup>26</sup> Ioab therfore fought against Rabbath of the
children of Ammon, and wonne the kinges citie. <sup>27</sup> And
Ioab sent messengers to Dauid, saying: I haue fought against
Rabbath, and the Citie of waters is to be taken. <sup>28</sup> Now ther-
fore gather the rest of the people, and besiege the citie, & take
it: lest when the citie shal be wasted of me, the victorie be a-
scribed to my name. <sup>29</sup> Dauid therfore gathered al the people,
and went forth against Rabbath: and when he had fought, he
tooke it. <sup>30</sup> And he tooke the crowne of their king from his
head, in weight a talent of gold, hauing most pretious stones,
and it was put vpon Dauids head. Yea & the praye of the citie
he caryed away exceeding much: <sup>31</sup> bringing forth also the
people thereof sawed them, and drewe round about ouer them
chariotes shod with yron: and he diuided them with kniues,
and drew them through in forme of brikes: so did he to al
the cities of the children of Ammon: and Dauid returned,
and al the armie into Ierusalem.
