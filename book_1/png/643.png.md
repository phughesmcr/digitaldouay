And Dauid rising went downe into the desert of Pharan. <sup>2</sup> And there was a certaine man in the wildernes of Maon, and his possession in Carmel, and that man was exceding great: and he had three thousand sheepe, & a thousand goates: and it chanced that his flocke was shorne in Carmel. <sup>3</sup> And the name of that man was Nabal: and the name of his wife Abigail. and that woman was very wise and beutiful: moreouer her husband hard, and very il, and malicious: and he was of the kindred of Caleb. <sup>4</sup> When Dauid therefore heard in the desert, that Nabal sheared his flocke, <sup>5</sup> he sent tenne yong men, and sayd to them: Goe vp into Carmel, and you shal come to Nabal, and shal salute him in my name peaceably. <sup>6</sup> And you shal say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and peace to thy house, and to al whatsoever thou hast be peace. <sup>7</sup> I haue heard, that thy shephards which were with vs in the desert did sheare we haue neuer molested them, neither hath ought beene wanting to them at any time of the flocke, al the time that they were with vs in Carmel. <sup>8</sup> Aske thy seruantes, and they wil tel thee.
