<sup>4</sup>wept and speaking to him prayed him, that he would com-
mand that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most
wicked deuises, which he had inuented agaynst the Iewes,
should be of none effect. <sup>4</sup>But he after the maner put forth
the golden scepter with his hand, by the which the signe of
clemencie was shewed: and she rysing vp stood before him,
<sup>5</sup>and said: If it please the king, and if I haue found grace in
his eies, and my request seme not contrarie to him, I besech
thee, that the old letters of Aman the traytour and enemie of
the Iewes, wherein he commanded that in al the kings pro-
uinces they should perish, may by new letters be corrected.
<sup>6</sup>For how can I abide the murder and slaughter of my peo-
ple? <sup>7</sup>And king Assuerus answered Esther the queene, and
Mardocheus the Iewe: Amans house I haue geuen to Esther,
and him self I haue commanded to be hanged on the gallo-
wes, because he durst lay handes on the Iewes. <sup>8</sup>Write ye
therfore to the Iewes, as pleaseth you, in the kings name,
signing the letters with my ring. For this was the custome,
that no man durst speake against the letters, which were sent
in the kings name, and were signed with his ring. <sup>9</sup>And the
kings scribes and secretaries being cald for (and it was the
time of the third moneth, which is called Siban) the three
and twenteth day therof letters were written, as Mardocheus
would, to the Iewes, and to the princes, and the lieutenan-
tes and iudges, which were rulers ouer the hundred and se-
uen and twentie prouinces, from India euen to Ã†thiopia: to
prouince and prouince, to people and people, according to
their languages and characters, and to the Iewes, according
as they could read, and heare. <sup>10</sup>And the said letters, which
were sent in the kings name, were signed with his ring, and
sent by ryding postes: which running through al the prouin-
ces, should preuent the old letters with the new messages.
<sup>11</sup>To whom the king gaue commandment, that they should
speake to the Iewes in euerie citie, and should command
them to be gathered together in one, that they might stand
for their liues, and might kil and destroy al their enemies with
their wiues and children and al their houses, and to take the
spoyle of them. <sup>12</sup>And there was appointed through al the
preuinces one day of reuenge, that is, the thirtenth of the
twelfth moneth Adar. <sup>13</sup>And this was the content of the
letter, that in al landes and peoples, which were subiect to

[^1]: kinges, yea though they be infideles, because they haue terrestrial maiestie and authoritie from God. And the contrarie opinion and behauiour of here-tikes, which despise Dominion and blaspheme Maiestie, is condemned by S. Iude, in his Epistle. v. 8.
