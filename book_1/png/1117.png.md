of Iob, 1097

<sup>9</sup>The inspiration of the Omnipotent geueth vnderstanding. They of many yeares are not the wise men, neither doe the ancien-tes vnderstand iudgement. <sup>10</sup>Therfore wil I speake: Heare ye me, I also wil shew you my wisedom. <sup>11</sup>For I haue expected your wordes, I haue heard your wisdom, as long as you contended in wordes. <sup>12</sup>And as long as I thought you said somewhat, I considered: but as I see, there is none of you that can reproue Iob, and answer to his wordes. <sup>13</sup>Lest perhaps you may say: We haue found wisedom, God hath reiected him not man. <sup>14</sup>He hath spoken nothing to me, and I wil not answer him according to your wordes. <sup>15</sup>They were afreyd, and answered no more, & they haue taken away talke from themselues. <sup>16</sup>Therfore because I haue expected, and they spake not: they stoode, & answered no more: <sup>17</sup>I also wil answer my part, and wil shew my knowledge. <sup>18</sup>For I am ful of wordes, and the spirit of my bellie streyneth me. <sup>19</sup>Behold, my bellie is as new wine without a vent, which breaketh new vessels. <sup>20</sup>I wil speake, and take breath a litle: I wil open my lippes, and wil answer. <sup>21</sup>I wil not accept the person of a man, and I wil not make God equal to man. <sup>22</sup>For I know not how long I shal continue, and whether after a while my maker wil take me away.

CHAP. XXXIII.

*Eliu endeuoreth to proue by Iobs speech that he is vniust: 13. arguing that God (by afflicting him) hath already so iudged. 23. but if by an Angels ad-monition he repent, al shal be remitted.*

<sup>1</sup>HEARE therfore Iob my sayings, and harken to al my wordes. <sup>2</sup>Behold I haue opened my mouth, let my tongue speake within my iawes. <sup>3</sup>My wordes are of my sim-ple hart, and my lippes shal speake a pure sentence. <sup>4</sup>The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Omnipotent gaue me life. <sup>5</sup>If thou canst, answer me, and stand against my face. <sup>6</sup>Behold God hath made me also euen as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed. <sup>7</sup>But yet let not my mira-cle terrifie thee, and let not my eloquence be burdenous to thee. <sup>8</sup>Thou therfore hast sayd in my eares, and I haue heard the voice of thy wordes: <sup>9</sup>I am cleane, and without sinne: vnspotted, and there is no iniquitie in me. <sup>10</sup>Because he hath found quarrels in me, therfore hath he thought me his enemy <sup>11</sup>He hath put my feete in the stockes, he hath obserued al my
