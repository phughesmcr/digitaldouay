Moreover Ioathan his sonne governed the kinges house, and iudged the people of the land. <sup>22</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ozias the first and the last wrote Isaias the sonne of Amos, the prophet. <sup>23</sup> And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the kinges sepulchres field, because he was a leper: and Ioathan his sonne reigned for him.

*Ioathan a godlie king, 5 prevaileth in battel against the Ammonites, 7 dieth, and his sonne Achaz succedeth.*

<sup>1</sup> Five and twentie yeares old was Ioathan when he began to reigne, and he reigned sixtene yeares in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Ierusa the daugter of Sadoc. <sup>2</sup> And he did that which was right before our Lord, according to al thinges, which Ozias his father had done, sauing that he entered not into the temple of our Lord, and as yet the people did sinne. <sup>3</sup> He built the high gate of the house of our Lord, and in the wal of Ophel he built manie thinges. <sup>4</sup> Cities also he built in the mountaynes of Iuda, and castelles and towres in the forrestes. <sup>5</sup> He fought agaynst the king of the children of Ammon, and ouercame them, and the children of Ammon gaue him at that time an hundred talentes of siluer, and tenne thousand cores of wheate, and as manie cores of barley: the children of Ammon gaue him these thinges in the second and third yeare. <sup>6</sup> And Ioathan was strengthened, because he had directed his waies before our Lord his God. <sup>7</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ioathan, and al his battels, and workes, are writen in the Booke of the kinges of Israel and Iuda. <sup>8</sup> He was fiue and twentie yeares old when he began to reigne, and he reigned sixtene yeares in Ierusalem. <sup>9</sup> And Ioathan slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the Citie of Dauid: and Achaz his sonne reigned for him.
