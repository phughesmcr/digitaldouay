ESTHER.

cause in the same dayes the Iewes reuenged them selues of their enemies, and mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and ioy, and that these should be dayes of good cheere and gladnesse, and they should send one to an other portions of meates, and should geue giftes to the poore. <sup>23</sup> And the Iewes receiued into a solemne rite al things, which they had begune to doe at that time, and which Mardocheus by letters had commanded to be done. <sup>24</sup> For Aman, the sonne of Amadathi of the stocke of Agag, the enemie and aduersarie of the Iewes, purposed euil against them, to kil them and destroy them: and he cast Phur, which in our language is turned, a lot. <sup>25</sup> And afterward Esther went in to the king, beseching that his endeuours might by the kings letters be made voyde: & the euil that he had intended against the Iewes, might returne vpon his owne head. Finally they hong both him and his sonnes vpon the gallowes, <sup>26</sup> and since that time these dayes are called Phurim, that is, of Lottes: because Phur, that is, a lot, was cast into the pot. And al things, that were done, are contayned in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this booke: <sup>27</sup> and the thinges that they susteyned, and that were afterward changed, the Iewes tooke vpon them selues and their seede, and vpon al, that would be ioyned to theyr religion, that it should be lawful for none to passe without solemnitie these dayes: which the writing testifieth, and certaine times require, as yeares continually succede one an other. <sup>28</sup> These are daies, which no obliuion shal euer put out: and al prouinces in al the world shal celebrate through out al generations: neither is there any citie, wherein the daies of Phurim, that is, of lottes, must not be obserued of the Iewes, and of their progenie, which is bound to these ceremonies. <sup>29</sup> And Esther the queene the daughter of Abihail, and Mardocheus the Iew wrote also the second epistle, that with al diligence this day should be established solemne for the time to come. <sup>30</sup> And they sent to al the Iewes, that were in the hundred and seuen and twentie prouinces of king Assuerus, that they should haue peace, and receiue truth, <sup>31</sup> obseruing the Daies of lottes, and in their time should celebrate them with ioy: as Mardocheus and Esther had appoynted, and they tooke vpon them to be obserued of them selues, and of their seede, fastes, and cries, and the daies of Lottes, <sup>32</sup> and al thinges, which are conteyned in the historie of this booke, which is called Esther.
