Yet asking her no questi- on, they let her passe, saying: The God of our fathers geue thee grace, and strengthen al the counsel of thy hart, with his powre, that Ierusalem may glorie vpon thee, and thy name may be in the number of the holie and iust. <sup>9</sup> And they that <sup>10</sup> were there said, al with one voyce: So be it, so be it.
