<sup>3</sup>called Salomon his sonne: and commanded him that he should build a house to our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>7</sup>And Dauid sayd to Salomon: My sonne, it was my wil to haue built a house to the name of our Lord my God. <sup>8</sup>But the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Thou hast shed much bloud, and fought verie manie battels, thou canst not build a house to my name, so much bloud being shed before me: <sup>9</sup>the sonne, which shal be borne to thee, shal be a most quiet man: for I wil make him rest from al his enemies round about: and for this cause, he shal be called Peaceable: and I wil geue peace and quietnesse in Israel al his dayes. <sup>10</sup>He shal build a house to my name, & he shal be to me for a sonne, and I wil be to him for a father: and I wil establish the throne of his kingdom ouer Israel for euer. <sup>11</sup>Now therefore my sonne, Our Lord be with thee, and doe thou prosper, and build the house to our Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee. <sup>12</sup>Our Lord also giue thee wisdome and vnderstanding, that thou mayst be able to rule Israel, and to kepe the law of our Lord thy God <sup>13</sup>For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou shalt keepe the commandementes, and iudgementes, which our Lord commanded Moyses to teach Israel: take courage and play the man, feare not, neither be dismayed. <sup>14</sup>Behold I in my pouertie haue prepared the charges of the house of our Lord, of gold an hundred thousand talentes, and of siluer a thousand thousand talentes: but of brasse, and of yron there is not weight, for the number is surpassed with the greatnesse: timber and stones I haue prepared to al the charges. <sup>15</sup>Thou hast also verie manie artificers, hewers of stones, and masons, & carpenters, and of al occupations most skilful to make worke, <sup>16</sup>in gold and siluer and brasse and yron, wherof there is no number. Ryse therfore, and do it, and our Lord wil be with thee. <sup>17</sup>Dauid also commanded al the princes of Israel, that they should help Salomon his sonne. <sup>18</sup>You see, quoth he, that our Lord your God is with you, and hath geuen you rest round about, and hath deliuered al your enemies into your handes, and the land is subdewed before our Lord, and before his people. <sup>19</sup>Geue therfore your hart and your soules, to seeke our Lord your God: and arise, and build a sanctuarie to our Lord God, that the Arke of the couenant of our Lord, and the vessels consecrated to our Lord, may be brought into the house, which is built to the name of our Lord.
