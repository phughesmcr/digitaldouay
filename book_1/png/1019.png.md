CHAP. VII.

*They are kindly entertained by Raguel. 10 Tobias demandeth Sara to Wife,
which Raguel, encouraged by the Angel, granteth. 15. and the mariage is
made.*

<sup>1</sup> AND they went to Raguel, and Raguel receiued them
with ioy. <sup>2</sup> And Raguel beholding Tobias, sayd to
Anna his wife: How like is this yongman to my sisters sonne!
<sup>3</sup> And when he had spoken these wordes, he sayd: Whence
are you ye yongmen our brethren? <sup>4</sup> But they sayd: We are
of the tribe of Nephthali, of the captiuitie of Niniue. <sup>5</sup> And
Raguel sayd to them: Know you Tobias my brother? Who
sayd: We know him. <sup>6</sup> And when he spake much good of
him, the Angel sayd to Raguel: Tobias, of whom thou askest
is this mans father. <sup>7</sup> And Raguel put forth him selfe, and
with teares kissed him, and weeping vpon his necke, sayd:
Blessing haue thou my sonne, because thou art the sonne of
a good and most vertuous man. <sup>8</sup> And Anna his wife, and
Sara theyr daughter wept. <sup>9</sup> And after they had talked, Raguel
commanded a wether to be killed, and a banket to be
prepared. And when he desired them to sitte downe to dinner,
<sup>10</sup> Tobias said: I wil not eate nor drinke here this day, vnlesse
thou first assure my petition, and promise to geue me Sara thy
daughter. <sup>11</sup> Which word Raguel hearing, was sore afrayd,
knowing what had chanced to those seuen husbands, which
went in vnto her: and he began to feare lest perhaps it might
chance to him also in like maner: and when he doubted, and
gaue no answer to him demanding, <sup>12</sup> the Angel sayd to
him: Feare not to geue her to this man, for to him fearing
God is thy daughter dewe to be his wife: therfore an other
could not haue her. <sup>13</sup> Then sayd Raguel: I doubt not but
God hath admitted my prayers and teares in his sight. <sup>14</sup> And
I beleue that therfore he hath made you come to me, that
this mayde might be ioyned to her kinred, according to the
law of Moyses: and now haue no doubt but I wil deliuer her
to thee.
