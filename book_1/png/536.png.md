# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF IVDGES.

SAINCT Hierom *giving this general rule* (Epist. ad Eustoch. virg.) that in reading historical bookes of holie Scripture, the historie, as fundation of veritie, is to be loved, but the spiritual vnderstanding rather to be folowed: *agreeably therto teacheth* (Epist ad paulin.) that in this booke of Iudges there be as manie figures, as princes of the people. Neither doth he meane that there were no more, but for example sake affirmeth that these Iudges, raised vp after Iosue, and sent of God to deliver the people fallen for their sinnes into afflictions; were types and figures of the Apostles and Apostolical men, sent by Christ to propagate and defend his Church of the new Testament. For albeit divers of these Iudges were sometimes great offenders, yet they were reclamed by Gods special grace, and amending their errors did great thinges, to the singular honour of God: and are renowmed among the holie Patriarces and Prophetes, particularly praised in holie Scripture, saying: And the Iudges, euerie one by his name, whose hart was not corrupt: who were not auerted from our Lord, that their memorie may be blessed, and their bones spring out from their place, and their name remaine for euer, the glorie of holie men remaining to their children. After Iosue therfore, who it semeth guided and ruled the people 32. yeares, this booke, written (as it most probably) by Samuel, shewing the famouse Actes of these Iudges of Israel, prosecuteth the historie of the Church the space of 288. yeares more. And may be divided into three partes. First, is described in general the state of the people, sometimes wel and sincerly serving God, other times falling to great sinnes, in the two first chapters. Secondly, their offences, afflictions, repentance, and deliverie from their enemies are more particularly reported, from the third chap. to the 17. Thirdly, other special accidents, which happened within the same time, are recorded, in the last five chapters.
