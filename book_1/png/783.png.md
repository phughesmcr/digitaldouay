And Eliseus sayd: I besech thee that in me may be thy duble spirit. <sup>10</sup> Who answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: Neuerthelesse if thou see me, when I shal be taken from thee, thou shalt haue that thou hast asked: but if thou see me not, thou shalt not haue it. <sup>11</sup> And when they went forward, and going talked together, behold a fyrie chariote, and fyrie horses parted them two asunder: and Elias ascended by a hurle winde into heauen. <sup>12</sup> And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariote of Israel, and the guider therof.
