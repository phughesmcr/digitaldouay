Samuel, Saul. OF KINGES. 593

men, that are in Iabes Galaad: To morow, when the sunne shal waxe hote, you shal haue relife. The messengers therefore came, and told the men of Iabes: who were glad. <sup>10</sup> And they said: In the morning we wil come forth to you: and you shal doe to vs whatsoeuer shal please you. <sup>11</sup> And it came to passe, when the morow was come, Saul sette the people into three partes: and entered into the middes of the campe in the morning watch, and stroke Ammon vntil the day waxed hote, and the rest were dispersed, so that there were not left among them two together. <sup>12</sup> And the people sayd to Samuel: Who is this that said: what shal Saul reigne ouer vs?

CHAP. XII.

Samuel being iustified by the people for his good behauiour, 6. chargeth them with ingratitude towardes God; 14. admonishing them, and shewing by a signe, that they offended in demanding a king. 20. Exhorteth them now to serue God, promiseth to pray for them, and forewarneth what they shal receiue as they deserue.

<sup>1</sup> AND Samuel sayd to al Israel: Behold I haue heard your voice according to al thinges which you haue spoken to me, and I haue appointed a king ouer you. <sup>2</sup> And now the king goeth before you: and I am waxen old and haue gray heares: moreouer my sonnes are with you: therfore hauing conuersed with you from my youth vntil this day, loe I am readie. <sup>3</sup> Speake of me before our Lord, and before his Christ, whether I haue taken any mans oxe, or asse: If I haue calumniated any man, if I haue oppressed any man, if I haue taken gift of any mans hand: and I wil contemne that same this day, and wil restore it to you. <sup>4</sup> And they said thou hast not calumniated vs, nor oppressed vs, nor taken ought of any mans hand. <sup>5</sup> And he sayd to them: Witnes is our Lord against you, and witnes is his Christ in this day, that you haue not found any thing in my hand. And

<aside>As the men of Iabes deluded their enemies by equiuocation, so speaking that they were otherwise vnderstood then they meant: so the seruantes of God being tempted with concupiscence, of gluttonie (signified by Naas) must deceiue their carnal appetite, by promising to satisfie the desire of the flesh, but in deed kepe such temperance, as they may kil the concupiscence, and not be killed by it. S. Greg. li. 5. c. 1. in 1. Reg. 11.</aside>
