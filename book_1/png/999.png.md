fensed cities and fatte ground, and possessed houses ful of al
goodes: cisternes made by others, vineyardes, and oliuetes,
& manie trees that bare fruite: and they did eate, and were
filled, and became fatte, and abounded with delicious thinges
in thy great goodnes. <sup>26</sup> But they prouoked thee to wrath, &
departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backes:
& they killed thy prophetes, which admonished them ernest-
ly to returne to thee: and they did great blasphemies. <sup>27</sup> And
thou gauest them into the handes of their enemies, and they
afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried
to thee, & thou from heauen didst heare, and according to thy
manie compassions gauest them sauiours, that should saue them
from the hand of their enemies. <sup>28</sup> And when they had rested,
they returned to do euil in thy sight: & thou didst leaue them
in the hand of their enemies, and they possessed them. And
they returned, & cried to thee: & thou heardest from heauen,

heard not, and thou didst deliuer them into the hand of the
peoples of the nations. <sup>31</sup> But in thy very many mercies thou
madest them not into consumption, neither didst thou forsake
them: because a God of compassions and gratious art
thou. <sup>32</sup> Now therfore O our God, great, strong, and ter-
rible, keeping couenant and mercie, turne not away from thy
face al the labour, which hath found vs, our Kinges, and our
Princes, and our Priestes, and our Prophetes, and our fathers,
and al the people from the daies of the king of Assur, vntil
this day. <sup>33</sup> And thou art iust in al thinges, that haue come
vpon vs: because thou hast done truth: but we haue done
wickedly. <sup>34</sup> Our Kinges, our Princes, our Priestes, and our
fathers haue not done thy law, and haue not attended thy
commandmentes, and thy testimonies which thou hast te-
stified among them. <sup>35</sup> And they in their reignes, and in
thy manifold goodnes, which thou gauest them, and in the
land most large and fatte, which thou didst deliuer in their
