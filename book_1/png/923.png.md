and stroke Edom, which had compassed him, and al the cap-
taynes of his horsemen. <sup>10</sup> But yet Edom rebelled, from being
vnder the dominion of Iuda vntil this day: at that time Lob-
na also reuolted, from being vnder his hand. For he had for-
saken our Lord the God of their fathers: <sup>11</sup> moreouer he built
also excelses in the cities of Iuda, and he made the inhabi-
tantes of Ierusalem to fornicate, and Iuda to transgresse.
<sup>12</sup> And there were letters brought him from Elias the pro-
phete, in which was writen: Thus sayth our Lord the God
of Dauid thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the
waies of Iosaphat thy father, & in the waies of Asa the king
of Iuda, <sup>13</sup> but hast gone by the waies of the kinges of Israel,
and hast made Iuda to fornicate, and the inhabitantes of
Ierusalem, hauing imitated the fornication of the house of
Achab, moreouer also hast killed thy brethren, the house of
thy father, better men then thou: <sup>14</sup> behold our Lord wil
strike thee with a great plague with al thy people, and chil-
dren, and thy wiues, and al thy substance. <sup>15</sup> And thou shalt be
sicke of a very sore disease of thy bealie, til thy vital partes
come forth by litle and litle euerie day. <sup>16</sup> Our Lord therefore
raised vp agaynst Ioram the spirit of the Philisthianes, and of
the Arabians, which are borderers to the Ã†thiopians. <sup>17</sup> and
they went vp into the Land of Iuda, and wasted it, and they
spoyled al the substance, that was found in the kinges house,
moreouer also his sonnes, and wiues: neither was there a
sonne left him but Ioachaz, who was the yongest. <sup>18</sup> And
beside al these thinges our Lord stroke him with an incu-
rable disease of the bealie. <sup>19</sup> And when day succeded day, and
the spaces of times passed about, the circuite of two yeares
was complete: and soe being wasted with a long consump-
tion, soe that he voyded euen his very bowels, he was ridde
of the disease, and of his life together. And he died in an
exceding vile infirmitie, & the people made him not exequies
according to the maner of burning, as they had done to
his ancesters. <sup>20</sup> He was two and thirtie yeares old, when he
began to reigne, and he reigned eight yeares in Ierusalem.
And he walked not rightly, and they buried him in the Citie
of Dauid: but yet not in the sepulchre of the kinges.
