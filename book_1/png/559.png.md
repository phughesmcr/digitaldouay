Israel three and twentie yeares, and died and was buried in
Samir. <sup>3</sup> After him succeded Iair the Galaadite, who iudged
Israel for two and twentie yeares, <sup>4</sup> hauing thirtie sonnes sitting vpon thirtie asse coltes, & princes of thirtie cities, which
of his name were called Hauoth Iair, that is, the townes
of Iair, vntil this present day in the Land of Galaad. <sup>5</sup> And
Iair died; and was buried in the place, which is called
Canon. <sup>6</sup> But the children of Israel ioyning new sinnes to
their old, did euil in the sight of our Lord, & serued the Idols,
Baalim and Astaroth, & the goddes of Syria and of Sidon and
of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philisthimes: and they left our Lord, and did not serue him. <sup>7</sup> Against whom our Lord being wrath, deliuered them into the
handes of the Philisthijms and of the children of Ammon.
<sup>8</sup> And they were afflicted, and sore oppressed for eightene
yeares, al that dwelt beyond Iordan in the Land of the
Amorrheite, which is in Galaad: <sup>9</sup> in so much, that the children of Ammon passing ouer Iordan, wasted Iudas and Beniamin and Ephraim: and Israel was afflicted exceedingly. <sup>10</sup> And
crying to our Lord, they said: We haue sinned to thee, because we haue forsaken our Lord God & haue serued Baalim.
<sup>11</sup> To whom our Lord spake: Haue not the Ã†gyptians and
the Amorrheites, and the children of Ammon and the Philisthijms, <sup>12</sup> the Sidonians also and Amalech and Chanaan
oppressed you, & you cried to me, and I deliuered you out of
their hand? <sup>13</sup> And yet you haue forsaken me, and haue worshipped strange goddes: therfore I wil not adde to deliuer
you any more: <sup>14</sup> goe and inuocate the goddes which you
haue chosen: let them deliuer you in the time of distresse.
<sup>15</sup> And the children of Israel said to our Lord: We haue sinned,
render to vs whatsoeuer pleaseth thee: only now deliuer vs.
<sup>16</sup> In saying which thinges, they threw away out of their
coastes al the idols of strange goddes, and serued our Lord
God: who sorowed for their miseries. <sup>17</sup> Therfore the children of Ammon crying together pitcht their tentes in Galaad: against whom the children of Israel being assembled
camped in Maspha. <sup>18</sup> And the princes of Galaad said euerie
one to their neighbours: Who of vs shal first beginne to
fight against the children of Ammon, shal be the duke of the
people of Galaad.
