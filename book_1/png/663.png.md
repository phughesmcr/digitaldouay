David, *OF KINGES.* 643

partes, and he died, in reuenge of the bloud of Asael his
brother. <sup>28</sup> Which when Dauid had heard, that the thing
was now done, he said: I am innocent, and my kingdom be-
fore God for euer from the bloud of Abner the sonne of Ner,
<sup>29</sup> and come it vpon the head of Ioab, and vpon al his fathers
house: neither let there fayle of the house of Ioab one hauing
a fluxe of seede, and a leper, and holding the distaffe, and
falling by the sword, lacking bread. <sup>30</sup> Ioab therefore and
Abisai his brother slewe Abner, because he had killed Asael
their brother in Gabaon in the battel. <sup>31</sup> And Dauid said to
Ioab, and to al the people, that were with him: Rent your
garmentes, and be girded with sacke clothes, and mourne
before the funeral of Abner. Moreouer king Dauid folowed
the beere. <sup>32</sup> And when they had buried Abner in Hebron,
king Dauid lifted vp his voice, and wept vpon the graue of
Abner: and al the people also wept. <sup>33</sup> And the king mour-
ning and lamenting Abner, sayd: Not as cowardes are wont
to die, hath Abner died. <sup>34</sup> Thy handes were not bound, and
thy feete were not loden with fetters: but as men are wont
to fal before the children of iniquitie, so art thou fallen. And
al the people dubling it wept vpon him. <sup>35</sup> And when al the
multitude was come to take meate with Dauid, when it was
yet cleere day Dauid sware, saying: These thinges do God to
me, and these adde he, if before sunne set I shal tast bread or
any thing els. <sup>36</sup> And al the people heard, and al thinges plea-
sed them which the king did in the sight of al the people.
<sup>37</sup> And al the people knewe, and al Israel in that day that it
was not the kinges doing, that Abner the sonne of Ner was
slayne. <sup>38</sup> The king also said to his seruantes: Are you igno-
rant that a prince and the greatest is slayne this day in Israel?
<sup>39</sup> But I as yet :: delicate, and annointed king: moreouer the
the sonnes of Saruia are hard to me: our Lord reward him
that doth euil according to his malice.
