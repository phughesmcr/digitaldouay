<sup>12</sup>waies. This therfore is it, wherein thou art not iustified: I wil answer thee, that God is greater then man. <sup>13</sup>Doest thou contend against him because he hath not answered thee to al wordes?

<sup>14</sup>God speaketh once, & repeateth not the self same the second time. <sup>15</sup>By a dreame in a vision by night, when heauie sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe in their bed. <sup>16</sup>Then doth he open the eares of men, & teaching instructeth them with discipline, <sup>17</sup>That he may turne a man from these things, which he doth, & may deliuer him from pride: <sup>18</sup>Deliuering his soule from corruption: and his life, that it passe not vnto the sword. <sup>19</sup>He rebuketh also by sorow in the bed, and he maketh al his bones to wither. <sup>20</sup>Bread is become abominable to him in his life, and to his soule the meate before desired. <sup>21</sup>His flesh shal consume, and the bones that had beene couered, shal be made naked. <sup>22</sup>His soule hath approached to corruption, and his life to things causing death. <sup>23</sup>If there shal be an Angel speaking for him, one of thousandes, to declare mans equitie. <sup>24</sup>He shal haue mercie on him, and shal say: deliuer him, that he descend not into corruption: I haue found wherein I may be propitious to him. <sup>25</sup>His flesh is consumed with punishments, let it returne to the daies of his youth. <sup>26</sup>He shal beseche God, and he wil be pacified towards him: and he shal see his face in iubilation, and he wil render to a man his iustice. <sup>27</sup>He shal behold men, and shal say: I haue sinned, and in deede I haue offended, and, as I was worthie, I haue not receiued. <sup>28</sup>He hath deliuered his soule that it should not goe into death, but liuing should see the light. <sup>29</sup>Behold, al these things doth God worke three times in euerie one. <sup>30</sup>That he may reclame their soules from corruption, and illuminate them with the light of the liuing. <sup>31</sup>Attend Iob, and heare me: and hold thy peace, whiles I speake. <sup>32</sup>But if thou hast what to speake, answer me, speake: for I would thee to appeare iust. <sup>33</sup>And if thou haue not, heare me: hold thy peace, and I wil teach thee wisedom.

CHAP. XXXIII.

*Against Eliu chargeth Iob with blasphemie, and other crimes, 10. sheweth the equitie of Gods iudgements: 20. and that al things are subiect to Gods powre and knowledge.*

<sup>1</sup>ELiv therfore pronouncing, spake these wordes also. <sup>2</sup>Heare ye wise men my wordes, and ye learned harken to me:

[^1]: It is true that Gods wil once vttered ought to suffice al men, for he answereth not to ech one by a particular speach, but by common speach (or fact) satisfieth al mens questions. wherof S. Gregorie noteth this general rule. *vi. 14 precedentium su forma sequentium. The life of them that goe be fore timedes forme (or rule) of them that fo low. li. 23. c. 18. c. 19.*

[^2]: But Eliu falsely supposed that God by Iobs affliction had declared that he was a wicked man. For in dede God declared the contrarie. c. 1. v. 1. & c. 2. v. 3.
