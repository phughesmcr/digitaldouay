Then the watchmen must of necessitie runne to rayse vp their prince to battel. <sup>4</sup> And when the captaynes of them shal runne to the tabernacle of Holofernes, and shal finde him headles rowled in bloud, feare wil fal vpon them. <sup>5</sup> And when you shal know that they flee, goe after them securely, because our Lord wil destroy them vnder your feete. <sup>6</sup> Then Achior seeing the power, that God of Israel wrought, forsaking the rite of gentilitie, beleeued God, and circumcided the flesh of his prepuce, and was ioyned to the people of Israel, and al the succession of his kinred vntil this present day. <sup>7</sup> And immediatly as day brake, they hong the head of Holofernes vpon the walles, and euerie man tooke his armour, and they went forth with great noyse and shouting. <sup>8</sup> Which the watchmen seing, ranne to the tabernacle of Holofernes. <sup>9</sup> Moreouer they that were in the tabernacle, coming, and before the dore of the tabernacle making a noyse, to rayse him, they endeuored by art to disquiet him, that Holofernes might awake not by them raysing him, but by them making a noyse. <sup>10</sup> For no man durst by knocking, or entring, to open the chamber of the chiefe of the Assyrians. <sup>11</sup> But when his dukes and tribunes were come, and al the chiefe of the armie of the king of the Assyrians, they said to the chamberleyns: <sup>12</sup> Goe in, and awake him, because the mice yssuing out of their holes, haue presumed to prouoke vs to battel. <sup>13</sup> Then Vagao entring into his chamber, stoode before the cortine, and made a clapping with his handes: for he thought that he slept with Iudith. <sup>14</sup> But when with the sense of his eares he percieued no motion of person lying, he came neere to the cortine, and lifting it vp, and seing the bodie without the head of Holofernes weltred in his bloud vpon the ground, cried out in a lowd voyce with weeping, and rent his garmentes. <sup>15</sup> And going into the tabernacle of Iudith, he found her not, and he lept forth to the people, <sup>16</sup> and sayd: One Hebrewe woman hath made confusion in the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for behold Holofernes lyeth vpon the ground, and his head is not vpon him. <sup>17</sup> Which when the princes of the power of the Assyrians had heard, they al rent their garmentes, and intollerable feare and dread fel vpon them, <sup>18</sup> and their mindes were trubled excedingly. And there was made an incomparable crie in the middes of their campe.
