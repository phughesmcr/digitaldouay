<sup>10</sup> But if they shal say: Come vp to vs: let vs goe vp, because our Lord hath deliuered them in our handes, this shal be a signe vnto vs. <sup>11</sup> Both of them therefore appeared to the station of the Philisthims: & the Philistijms sayd: Behold the Hebrewes come out of the caues, wherein they were hid. <sup>12</sup> And the men of the garrison spake to Ionathas and to his esquire, and sayd: Come vp to vs, and we wil shew you a thing. And Ionathas sayd to his esquire: Let vs goe vp, folow me: for our Lord hath deliuered them into the handes of Israel. <sup>13</sup> And Ionathas went vp on his handes & feete creeping, and his esquier after him. Therefore some fel before Ionathas, other some his esquire folowing slewe. <sup>14</sup> And the first slaughter, with which Ionathas & his esquire made, was as it were of twentie men in the halfe part of an aker, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day. <sup>15</sup> And there was made a miracle in the campe, through the fieldes: yea and al the people of their garrison, which had gone to take prayes, was astonyed, and the land was trubled: and it happened as a miracle from God. <sup>16</sup> And the watchemen of Saul, which were in Gabaa, of Beniamin looked, & loe a multitude ouerthrowen, & fleeing hither and thither. <sup>17</sup> And Saul sayd to the people, which was with him: Enquire, and see who is gone from vs. And when they had sought, it was found that Ionathas was not present and his esquire. <sup>18</sup> And Saul sayd to Achias: Bring the arke of our Lord. (for the arke of God was there that day with the children of Israel.) <sup>19</sup> And when Saul spake to the priest, there arose a great tumult in the campe of the Philistijmes: and it grewe by litle and litle, and sounded more cleerly. And Saul sayd to the priest: Draw together thy hand. <sup>20</sup> Saul therefore and al the people that was with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold euerie mans sword had beene turned to his neighbour, and a slaughter exceeding great. <sup>21</sup> But the Hebrewes also which had bene with the Philistijms yesterday and the day before, and went vp with them in the campe, returned to be with Israel, which were with Saul and Ionathas. <sup>22</sup> Al the Israelites also which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, hearing that the Philistijms were fled, ioyned them selues with their fellowes in battel. And there were with Saul as it were ten thousand men. <sup>23</sup> And our Lord in that day saued Israel.
