there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand strong men, that could drawe sword: and of Iuda fiue hundred thousand fighting men. <sup>10</sup> But Dauids hart strooke him, after the people was numbred: and Dauid sayd to our Lord: I haue sinned very much in this fact: but I pray thee Lord to transferre the iniquitie of thy seruant, because I haue done exceeding folishly. <sup>11</sup> Dauid therfore arose in the morning, and the word of our Lord was made to Gad the prophete and Seer of Dauid, saying: <sup>12</sup> Goe, and speake to Dauid: Thus sayth our Lord: Choyse is geuen thee of three thinges, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee. <sup>13</sup> And when Gad was come to Dauid, he told him, saying: Either famine shal come to thee seuen yeares in thy land: or three monethes thou shalt flee thy aduersaries, and they shal pursew thee: or certes three dayes the pestilence shal be in thy land. Now therfore deliberate, and see what word I shal answer to him that sent me. <sup>14</sup> And Dauid sayd to Gad: I am distressed excedingly: but it is better that I fal into the handes of our Lord (for his mercies be manie) then into the handes of men. <sup>15</sup> And our Lord sent the pestilence in Israel, from morning vnto the time appoynted, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersabee seuentie thousand men. <sup>16</sup> And when the Angel of Our Lord had stretched forth his hand ouer Ierusalem to destroy it, our Lord had pitie vpon the affliction, and sayd to the Angel that stroke the people: It is sufficient: now hold thy hand: and the Angel of our Lord was beside the floore of Areuna the Iebuseite. <sup>17</sup> And Dauid sayd to our Lord when he saw the Angel striking the people: I am he that haue sinned, I haue done wickedly: these that are the sheepe, what haue they done? let thy hand, I beseche thee be turned agaynst me, and agaynst my fathers house. <sup>18</sup> And Gad came to Dauid in that day, and sayd to him: Goe vp, and build an altar to our Lord in the floore of Areuna the Iebuseite. <sup>19</sup> And Dauid went vp according to the word of Gad, which our Lord had commanded him. <sup>20</sup> And Areuna looking, perceiued the king and his seruantes to come towards him <sup>21</sup> And going forth he adored the king with his face bowing to the earth, and sayd: What is the cause that my lord the king cometh to his seruant? To whom Dauid sayd: That I may bye of thee the floore, and build an altar to our Lord, and the slaughter may cease which rageth among the people.
