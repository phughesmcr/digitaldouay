## ANNOTATIONS.

### CHAP. IX.

1. The case being changed.] In this whole historie (as in manie other passages of holie scripture) we see the meruelous change of the righthand of the highest. First in the verie instant of extreme danger, the kinges face with burning eyes shewing the furie of his breast *ch. 15. v. 10.* was turned into mildnes to<sup>2</sup>wardes Esther *v. 11.* Secondly proud Aman being aduanced to honour & office, aboue al princes of the kinges court, *ch. 3. v. 1.* was sodainly forced publikely to lead Mardocheus his horse, whom he most hated: *ch. 6. v. 10.* Thirdly, he was constrayned with loud voice to proclame his honour, whom he most despised and threated. Fourthly, the same Aman, before called the father (as it were the onlie gouernour) of the king, *ch. 15 v. 6 ch. 16. v. 11.* was forthwith condemned for a traitor. *ch. 7. v. 8. ch. 16. v. 18.* Fifthly, He that could not abide to see Mardocheus, *ch. 5. v. 13.* afterward durst not looke vpon the king, nor could endure his countenance. *ch, 7. v. 6.* Sixtly, He was hanged on the same gallowes, which he had prepared for Mardocheus. *ch. 7. v. 9.* Seuenthly, Wheras he was not content with the death of Mardocheus alone, but procured the kinges decree to destroy the whole nation: *13. 3. v. 6* and so feasted with the king, when the Iewes mourned, *v 15.* shortly after the king sent new letters for the Iewes safetie, geuing them leaue to kil whom soeuer they would of their enemies. *ch. 8. v. 8. 11.* Eightly, the same day which was designed for destruction, was made the day of ioy and exultation to the children of God. *ch. 9. v. 1. 17. ch. 16. v. 21.* &c. By which literal sense Gods meruelous prouidence is manifestly shewed, neuer suffering his church to perish. It hath moreouer two special mystical senses. First, as storie of temporal life was procured to Esther a figure one nation by Esthers intercession to king Assuerus, so general saluation is pro- of our B. ladie. cured to al mankind by mediation of the blessed virgin Marie, crushing the serpents head; and the sentence of death is changed by new letters, granting And of the euerlasting life, and glorie to al Gods true seruantes. Esther also, as likewise Church. Iudith, in figure of the Church (saith S. Ierom, *Prologo in Sophon.*) killed the aduersaries, and deliuered Israel from danger of perishing.
