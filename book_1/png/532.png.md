# Iosve.

## Chap. XXIII.

Iosue being old admonisheth the people to keepe Gods commandementes.

<sup>1</sup> And when much time was passed, after that our Lord had geuen peace to Israel, al the nations being subdewed round about, and Iosue now verie ancient, and of a great age: <sup>2</sup> Iosue called al Israel, and the elders, and the princes and the iudges, and the maisters, and said to them: I am old, and farre gone in age: <sup>3</sup> and you see al thinges, that our Lord your God hath done to al the nations round about, how him selfe hath fought for you: <sup>4</sup> and now because he hath by lotte diuided to you al the Land, from the East part of Iordan vnto the great sea, and manie nations yet remaine: <sup>5</sup> Our Lord your God wil destroy them, and take them away from your face, and you shal possesse the Land, as he hath promised you. <sup>6</sup> Onlie take courage, and be careful, that you keepe al thinges which be written in the volume of the law of Moyses: and decline not from them neither to the right hand nor to the left: <sup>7</sup> lest after that you are entred in to the Gentiles, which shal be among you, you sweare in the names of their goddes, and serue them, and adore them: <sup>8</sup> but cleaue to our Lord your God: which you haue done vntil this day. <sup>9</sup> And then our Lord God wil take away in your sight the great nations and very strong, and no man shal be able to resist you. <sup>10</sup> One of you shal pursue a thousand men of the enemies: because our Lord your God him self wil fight for you, as he hath promised. <sup>11</sup> This onlie beware very diligently before hand, that you loue our Lord your God. <sup>12</sup> But if you wil cleaue to the errour of these nations, that dwel among you, and make mariages with them, and ioyne amitie: <sup>13</sup> euen now know ye that our Lord your God wil not destroy them before your face, but they shal be a pitte and a snare for you, and a stumbling blocke at your side, and stakes in your eies, til he take you away and destroy you from this excellent Land, which he hath deliuered to you. <sup>14</sup> Behold I this day enter into the way of al flesh, and you shal know with al your minde that al the wordes, which our Lord promised that he would performe to you, one is not escaped without effect.

[^1]: God fought for the Israelites three maner of wayes: sometimes alone, they not fighting at al, as when the Ã†gyptians were drowned in the read sea: sometimes they doing his commandmentes the apparantly assisted them, as in the siege of Iericho, the walles miraculously fel downe (c. 6) & haile stones killed their enemies (chap. 10.) but most times inuisibly, as wel by geuing them courage, as by striking their enimies with terrour. And al these wayes God also fighteth for his seruantes in spiritual warres against the diuel, the flesh, & the world.
