and about thy sonne? Who answered: Wel. <sup>27</sup> And when she was come to the man of God into the mount, she caught his feet: and Giezi came to remoue her. And the man of God said: Let her alone, for her soule is in anguish, and our Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. <sup>28</sup> Who said to him: Did I aske a sonne of my Lord? Did I not say to thee: Mocke me not? <sup>29</sup> And he said to Giezi: Girde thy loynes, and take my staffe in thy hand, & goe. If a man meete thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and thou shalt put my staffe vpon the face of the childe. <sup>30</sup> Moreouer the mother of the childe said: Our Lord liueth, and thy soul liueth, I wil not leaue thee. He arose therfore, and folowed her. <sup>31</sup> But Giezi was gone before them, and had put the staffe vpon the face of the childe, & there was not voice, nor sense: and he returned to meete him, and told him, saying: The childe is not risen. <sup>32</sup> Eliseus therfore went into the house, and behold the childe lay dead on his bed: <sup>33</sup> and going in he shut the doore vpon him, & vpon the childe & prayed to our Lord. <sup>34</sup> And he went vp, and lay vpon the childe: and he put his mouth vpon his mouth, & his eies vpon his eies & his handes vpon his handes: and he bowed him self ouer him, and the childes flesh was warmed. <sup>35</sup> But he returning, walked vp and downe in the house, once hither & thither: & he went vp, and lay vpon him: and the childe gaped seuen tymes, and opened his eies. <sup>36</sup> And he called Giezi, & said to him: Call this Sunamite. Who being called, went in vnto him: Who said: Take thy sonne. <sup>37</sup> She came, and fel at his feete, and adored vpon the ground: and tooke her sonne, and went out, <sup>38</sup> and Eliseus returned into Galgal. And there was a famine in the land, and the children of the prophetes dwelt before him; and he sayd to one of his seruantes: Sette on a greate potte, and seeth broth for the children of the prophetes. <sup>39</sup> And one went out into the field to gather wilde herbes: and he found as it were a wilde vine, and gathered of it the colocynthides of the field, and filled his mantel, and returning cut it into the potte of broth, for he knew not what it was. <sup>40</sup> They therfore powred it to their felowes, to eate: and when they had tasted of the broth, they cried, saying: Death is in the potte, man of God. And they could not eate. <sup>41</sup> But he sayd: Bring meale, and when they had brought it, he cast it into the potte, and said: powre in for the multitude, that they may eate. And there
