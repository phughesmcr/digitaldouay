AND when David had passed a litle the toppe of the
Mount, Siba the seruant of Miphiboseth appeared
coming to meete him, with two asses, which were loden with
two hundred loaues, and a hundred bunches of raysens, an
hundred masses of figges, and a bottel of wine. <sup>2</sup> And the
king said to Siba: What meane these thinges? And Siba an-
swered: The asses are for the kinges houshold to sitte on:
and the loaues and the figges to eate for thy seruantes, and the
wine to drinke if any man shal fainte in the desert. <sup>3</sup> And
the king said: Where is thy masters sonne? And Siba answered
the king: He hath remained in Ierusalem, saying: This day
wil the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
<sup>4</sup> And the king said to Siba: Let al thinges be thine that
were Miphiboseths. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find
grace before thee, my lord king. <sup>5</sup> King Dauid therefore came
as farre as Bahurim: & behold there came forth thence a man
of the kinred of the house of Saul, named Semei, the sonne of
Gera, and he proceded going forth, & cursed. <sup>6</sup> And he threw
stones against Dauid, & against al the seruantes of king Dauid
& the whole people, & al the warriers went on the right, and
the left side of the king. <sup>7</sup> And thus spake Semei when he
cursed the king: Come forth, come forth thou man of bloud,
and man of Belial. <sup>8</sup> Our Lord hath repayed thee al the bloud
of the house of Saul: because thou hast inuaded the king-
dom for him, and our Lord hath geuen the kingdom into the
hand of Absalom thy sonne: and behold thyne euiles presse
thee, because thou art a man of bloud. <sup>9</sup> And Abisai the
sonne of Saruia said to the king: Why curseth this dead dogge
my lord the king? I wil goe, and strike of his head. <sup>10</sup> And
the king said: What is it to me and you, ye sonnes of Saruia?
Let him alone that he may curse: for our Lord hath "com-
manded him to curse Dauid: and who is he that dare say, why
hath he so done? <sup>11</sup> And the king said to Abisai, and to al his
seruantes: Behold my sonne, that came out of my wombe,
seeketh my life: how much more now the sonne of Iemini? let
him alone that he may curse according to the precept of our
Lord: <sup>12</sup> if perhaps our Lord may respect mine affliction, and
our Lord may render me good for this dayes cursing. <sup>13</sup> Da-
uid therefore walked and his companie in the way with him.
And Semei by the banke on the hils side, went ouer against
him, cursing, and casting stones against him, and sprinkling
earth

Semei, being

Dauids sinnes

but was not
the author of
his malice, for

committed no
