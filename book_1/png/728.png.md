# THIRDE BOOKE

Prescribed first day of the seuenth moneth: vvherin solemne feast vvas also prescribed from euening of the ninth day to euening of the tenth, for remission of sinnes in general, but let particular sacrifices in Leuiticus for euerie sinne, be read there in my self vulgate. The seuenth vvas the feast of Tabernacles, seuen dayes together, beginning the fifteenth of the seuenth month, in memorie of Gods special protection, vvhen they remained in tabernacles, fourtie yeares in the desert. The eight feast vvas of Assemblie and Collection, the next day after the forsaid seuen, in commemoration of vnion in the people, and peaceable possession in the promised land. In this day general collection vvas made for necessarie expences in the publique seruice of God.

<aside>Seuenth yeare of rest: and Iubily yeare.</aside>

Moreouer the seuenth yeare vvas as a sabbath of rest: (Leuit. 25.) in vvhich no land vvas plovved, no vine pruned, nor the fruites gathered that sprang vvithout mans industrie of the earth. Againe the fiftith yeare vvas peculiarly made holie, and called the Iubily, or ioiful yeare. In it al bond-men vvere sette free; al inheritances among the Israelites, being for the time, sold or othervvise alienated, returned to the former ovvners.

<aside>Other ceremonial obseruances.</aside>

Besides Sacrifices; Sacramentes; holie places, holie times, and manie other sacred thinges belonging to them; there vvere yet more ceremonial Obseruances commaunded by Moyses lavv, as vvel perteyning to the seruice of God in that time, as signifying christian life and maners. So certaine beastes, birdes, and fishes vvere reputed vnclene (Leuit. 11.) and Gods people forbid to eate them; as also that they should not eate anie bloud at al, nor fatte. Leui. 3. The reason of al vvhich vvas not, as though anie creature vvere il in nature, but partly to auoide idolatrie, partly to exercise them in obedience, and temperance; & partly for that the same thinges signified vices and corruptions, from vvhich Christians especially ought to refrain[^1]. Likevvise Leuit. 19. they vvere comman-ded not to sovv their fieldes vvith tvvo sortes of seede; nor to vveare garmentes vvouen of tvvo sortes of stuffe; that they might be more distinguished from infidels by external signes, and not only by Circumcision, but especially to teach christians to auoide simple innocencie, & to auoid duble & deciptful dealing.

<aside>No bloud to be eaten, nor fatte.</aside>

<aside>Not diuers seede in one field.</aside>

<aside>No cloth of diuers matter.</aside>

<aside>Strict commandment to keepe the Law.</aside>

Al vvhich, and other preceptes as vvel moral, as ceremonial and iudicial, vvere most strictly comanded; the obseruers blessed & revvarded, & trans-gressours seuerely threatened vvith great curses (Leuit. 20. 26. Deut. 4. 27. 28.) and diuers actually punished, Exod. 32. three thousand slaine for committing idolatrie. Manie svvallovved vp in the earth. Num. 16. yet fire coming quicke into hel, & manie more burned vvith fire from heauen, for murmuring and sinning against Moyses. Yet by one meanes & other, al that vvere aboue tvventie yeares of age, coming forth of AEgypt, except tvvo onlie (Iosue & Caleb) died in the desert, for the general murmuring of the people, Num. 11. 14. 25. & 26. Al Israel beaten in battel til one malefactor vvas discouered & punished. Ios. 7. Al the tribes vvere punished for suffering publique idolatrie in Dan: and Beniamin almost destroyed for defending malefactors. Iudic. 20.
