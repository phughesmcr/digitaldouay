Church and Religion. 941

altars, and imaginarie priestes, which were not of the children of
Leui. Also a feast the fifteenth day of the moneth, after the similitude of the solemnitie, that was celebrated in Iuda. At which holie scripture saith: He sourged of his owne hart. The very propertie of Archeretikes, not the true Priestes, Leuites, and manie others, that had geuen their hart to seke our Lord, went into Ierusalem, to immolate theire victimes before our Lord the God of their fathers. 2 Par. 11. The Naaman a stranger of Syria, and a Neophite in religion, taught by his example, that none may yeld conformitie, nor otherwise communicate with Infideles, then Gods Priests, or Prophetes approue for lawful. 4. Reg. 5.

Vnto the heresie of Ieroboam Achab, by Iezabels perswasion, added the worshipping of Baal, as God. 3. Reg. 16. making both temple and altar to him in Samaria. Ieroboams priestes seruing fitly this purpose. Though al the former heretikes no more agreed to this new heresie, then Lutherans now admitte of Caluinisme. For Iehua Ieroboamite destroyed al Iezabilites that he could by a stratageme gette together. 4. Reg. 10. v. 28. 29. Much lesse did al Israel serue Baal.

Reg. 17. they learning the rites of the Israelits religion, mixed their Paganisme therewith, and made a new heresie, or rather manie new heresies.

But as the Priestes, which taught them rites of true religion, allowed not of this mixture, so doubtles some people harkened to their admonitions, and kept religion simply and sincerely. And at this very time of the tenne tribes captiuitie, holie Tobias who was carried captiue with the rest, neither before nor after the captiuitie, leift the law of God. But went to Ierusalem (when others serued Ieroboams golden calues) to the Temple of our Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel. And in captiuitie bestowed himselfe in workes of mercie, towardes the liuing and dead of his nation. Tob. 1.

As for the kingdom of Iuda, it was more free from heresies. For very few or none of those kinges that fell to other grosse enormities, yea to manifest idolatrie, became heretikes, as is probablie collected by that Isaias the Prophet being sent to Achaz, admonished him, conuersed and dealt with him, as with one that beleued wholy and solely true religion: assuring him that God would protect Ierusalem, bidding him not to feare the two smoking firebrandes, in the wrath of Rasin king of Syria, and of Phacee king of Israel. Isa. 7. Further bidding him aske a signe of God, he answe-
