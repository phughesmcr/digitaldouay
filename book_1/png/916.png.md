IOSAPHAT therfore was rich and verie glorious, and was ioyned in affinitie to Achab. <sup>2</sup> And he went downe to him after certaine yeares into Samaria: at whose coming Achab killed muttons, and oxen very manie for him and the people that came with him: and he perswaded him to goe vp into Ramoth Galaad. <sup>3</sup> And Achab the king of Israel sayd to Iosaphat the king of Iuda: Come with me into Ramoth Galaad. To whom he answered: As I am thou also: as thy people, so my people also: and we wil be with thee in battel. <sup>4</sup> Iosaphat sayd to the king of Israel: Consult I besech thee presently the word of our Lord. <sup>5</sup> Therfore the king of Israel gathered together of the prophetes four hundred men, and sayd to them: Shal we goe into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sitte stil?
