these partes of the earth to the endes therof: and there thou
shalt serue strange goddes, which thou art ignorant of and
thy fathers, woode and stone. <sup>65</sup> In those nations also thou
shalt not be quiet, neither shal there be resting for the steppe
of thy foote. For our Lord wil geue thee a feareful hart, and
daseling eies, and a soule consumed with pensifenes: <sup>66</sup> and
thy life shal be as it were hanging before thee. Thou shalt
feare night and day, and thou shalt not trust in thy life. <sup>67</sup> In
the morning thou shalt say: Who wil graunt me euening? and
at euening: Who wil grant me morning? for the fearefulnes
of thy hart, wherwith thou shalt be terrified, and for those
thinges, which thou shalt see with thine eies. <sup>68</sup> Our Lord
shal bring thee againe with shippes into Ægypt by the way,
wherof he said to thee that thou shouldest see it no more.
There shalt thou be sould to thine enemies for bondmen and
bondweomen, and no man shal bye you.

and said to them: you saw al thinges, that our Lord did before
you in the Land of Ægypt to Pharao, and to al his seruantes,
and to his whole land, <sup>3</sup> the great tentations, which
thine eies haue seene, those mightie signes, and wonders,
<sup>4</sup> and our Lord :: hath not geuen you a hart to vnderstand,
and eies to see, and eares that can heare, vnto this present
day. <sup>5</sup> He hath brought you fourtie yeares by the desert: your
garmentes are not worne out, neither are the shoes of your
feete consumed with age. <sup>6</sup> Breade you haue not eaten, wine
and sicer you haue not drunke: that you might know that I
am the Lord your God. <sup>7</sup> And you came to this place: and
there came forth Sehon the King of Hesebon, and Og the
King of Basan, meeting vs to fight. And we stroke them,

and Gad, and the halfe tribe of Manasses. <sup>9</sup> Keepe ther-
