# Esther

<sup>4</sup> And he was of that number of captives, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had transported from Ierusalem with Ieconias the king of Iuda: <sup>5</sup> and this was his dreame: There appeared voices, and tumultes, and thunders and earth quakes, and perturbation vpon the earth: <sup>6</sup> and behold two great dragons, prepared one against an other into battel. <sup>7</sup> At whose crie al nations were raysed vppe, to fight against the nation of the iust. <sup>8</sup> And that was a day of darkenesse and danger, of tribulation and distresse, and great feare vpon the earth. <sup>9</sup> And the nation of the iust fearing their euils, was trubled, and prepared to death. <sup>10</sup> And they cried to God: and they crying, "a litle fountayne grew into a verie great riuer, and abounded into verie manie waters. <sup>11</sup> Light and sunne arose, and the humble were exalted, and they deuoured the glorious. <sup>12</sup> Which when Mardocheus had seene, and risen out of his bed, he mused what God would doe: and he had it fixed in his mind, desirous to know what the dreame should signifie?

## Chap. XII.
*The conspiracie of two eunuches, detected by Mardocheus, is repeted, 6. and Amans malice against him for the same.*

<sup>1</sup> And he abode that time in the kings court with Bagatha and Thara the kings eunuches, which were porters of the palace. <sup>2</sup> And when he vnderstood their cogitations, and had throughly seene their cares he learned that they went about to lay hands on king Artaxerxes, and he told the king therof. <sup>3</sup> Who hauing them both in examination, when they had confessed he commanded them to be led to death. <sup>4</sup> But the king wrote that which was done, in the comentaries: and Mardocheus also committed the memorie of the thing to writing. <sup>5</sup> And the king commanded him, that he should abide in the court of the palace, geuing him giftes for the delation. <sup>7</sup> But Aman the sonne of Amadathi the Bugeite was most glorious before the king, and would hurt Mardocheus, and his people, for the two eunuches of the king, which were put to death.

*Hitherto the proeme. That which foloweth was set in that place, where it is written in the volume: And they tooke their goodes.*
