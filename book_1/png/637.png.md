David: Lo here the sword of Goliath the Philistian, whom thou slewest in the Valley of terebinth, is wrapped vp in a mantel behind the Ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it. for neither is here any other beside that. And David said: There is none other like to that, geue me it. <sup>10</sup> David therefore arose, and fled that day from the face of Saul: and came to Achis <sup>11</sup> the king of Geth. <sup>†</sup> and the seruantes of Achis said to him, when they had seene Dauid: Is not this Dauid the king of the land? Did they not sing in dances to this man saying: Saul <sup>12</sup> stroke a thousand, and Dauid ten thousand? <sup>†</sup> But Dauid put these wordes in his hart, and feared excedingly at the face <sup>13</sup> of Achis the king of Geth. <sup>†</sup> And he :: changed his countenance before them, and slipt downe betwen their handes: and he stumbled at the doores of the gate, & his spittle ranne <sup>14</sup> downe vpon his bearde. <sup>†</sup> And Achis said to his seruantes: You haue seene the man madde: why haue you brought him <sup>15</sup> to me? <sup>†</sup> Do we lack madde men, that you haue brought in this felow to play the madde man in my presence? shal this man enter into my house?

CHAP. XXII.

*David with a great retinew goeth to the king of Moab 5. but by aduise of Gad the prophet, returneth into Iuda. 6. Saul lamenteth that many conspire against him. 9. Doeg accuseth Achimelech, 12. Who iustifieth both Dauid and himself. 16. He and al the Priestes with much people in Nobe are slaine by Sauls commandment, 20. onlie Abiathar escaping fleeth to Dauid.*

<sup>1</sup> DAVID therefore went from thence, and fled to the caue of Odellam. Which when his brethren had heard, and <sup>2</sup> his fathers house, they went downe to him thither. <sup>†</sup> And there were gathered vnto him, al that were in distresse, and oppressed with debt, and of a pensiue hart, and he was made their prince, and there were with him about foure hundred <sup>3</sup> men. <sup>†</sup> And Dauid departed from thence into Maspha, which is Moab: and he said to the king of Moab: Let my father and my mother tary with you, I beseech thee, til I know what <sup>4</sup> God wil doe to me. <sup>†</sup> And he left them before the face of the king of Moab, and they abode with him al the dayes, that <sup>5</sup> Dauid was in garrison. <sup>†</sup> And Gad the prophet said to Dauid: Tary not in garrison, depart, and goe into the Land of Iuda. And Dauid departed, and came into the forest of Haret.

[^1]: Dauid most wisely in such distresse fained himself to be a foole: By which the Holie Ghost mystically signified that Christ should do such things not of diuine wisdom, as he should be counted a foole.
