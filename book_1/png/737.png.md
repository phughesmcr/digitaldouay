Salomon. OF KINGES. 717

visite, *sayth our Lord*, their iniquities with a rodde, and their sinnes with stripes. But my mercie I wil not take away from him. *This is* (sayth S. Augustin) God promiseth, *yea sweareth and wil not lie to Dauid, that his seede shal continue for euer. His throne as the Sunne in Gods sight, and the Moone perfected for euer. So this great Doctor sheweth by holie Scriptures against the Donatistes, and in them against Protestantes, that the militant Church of Christ hath beene stil, and shalbe visible, during this transitorie world.*
