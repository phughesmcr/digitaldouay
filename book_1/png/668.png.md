<sup>23</sup> Therefore unto Michol the daughter of Saul was there no child borne unto the day of her death.

CHAP. VII.

*Dauids good purpose to build a Temple is disferred by Gods appointment, 12. with promise that his sonne shal performe it, and be established in the kingdom. 18. For al which he rendereth thankes to God.*

<sup>1</sup> And it came to passe when the king sate in his house, and our Lord had geuen him rest on euery side from al his enemies, <sup>2</sup> he sayd to Nathan the prophet: Doest thou see that I dwel in a house of cedar, and the arke of God is sette in the middes skinnes? <sup>3</sup> And Nathan sayd to the king: Al that is in thy hart, goe doe, because our Lord is with thee. <sup>4</sup> And it came to passe in that night: and behold the word of our Lord to Nathan, saying: <sup>5</sup> Goe, and speake to my seruant Dauid: Thus sayth our Lord: Shalt thou build me a house to dwel in? <sup>6</sup> For neither haue I dwelt in house from the day that I brought the children of Israel out of the Land of Ã†gypt, vntil this day: but I walked in tabernacle, and in tent. <sup>7</sup> Through out al the places, that I haue passed with al the children of Israel, speaking did I speake to one of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to feede my people Israel, saying: Why did you not build me a house of cedar? <sup>8</sup> And now these thinges shalt thou say to my seruant Dauid: Thus sayth the Lord of hostes: I tooke thee out of the pastures folowing the flockes, that thou shouldest be prince ouer my people Israel: <sup>9</sup> and I haue beene with thee wheresoeuer thou hast walked, and haue slayne al thine enemies from thy face: and haue made thee a great name, according to the name of the great ones, that are in the earth. <sup>10</sup> And I wil appoint a place for my people Israel, and wil plant it, and they shal dwel vnder it, and shal be trubled no more: neither shal the children of iniquitie adde to afflict them as before. <sup>11</sup> From the day that I appointed Iudges ouer my people Israel: and I wil geue thee rest from al thine enemies. and our Lord foretelleth thee, that our Lord wil make thee a house. <sup>12</sup> And when thy daies shal be accomplished, and thou shalt sleepe with thy fathers, I wil rayse vp thy seede after thee,

<aside>The tabernacle made by Moyses was goodliething, but being couered with skinnes and in manie respects insufficient for Gods seruice, Dauid desired to build a glorious Temple. But was not permitted to do it, for mysterie sake to signifie that Christ the true Salomon should build his Church, that farre excelleth the Synagogue of the Iewes, and old Testament</aside>
