<sup>1</sup> But the enemies of Iuda and Beniamin heard that the children of the captiuitie built a temple to our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>2</sup> And coming to Zorobabel, and the princes of the fathers, they sayd to them: Let vs build with you, because euen as you, so do we seeke your God: Behold we haue immolated victimes from the dayes of Asor Haddan the king of Assur, which brought vs hither. <sup>3</sup> And Zorobabel sayd to them, and Iosue, and the rest of the princes of the fathers of Israel: It is not for you and vs to build a house to our God, but we ourselues alone wil build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded vs. <sup>4</sup> It came to passe therefore that the people of the land hindered the handes of the people of Iuda, and trubled them in building. <sup>5</sup> And they hyred counselers agaynst them, to destroy theyr counsel al the dayes of Cyrus the king of the Persians, & vntil the reigne of Darius the king of the Persians. <sup>6</sup> And in the reigne of Assuerus in the begining of his reigne, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitantes of Iuda and Ierusalem. <sup>7</sup> And in the dayes of Artaxerxes Beselam, Mitridates, & Thabeel, & the rest that were in theyr counsel writ to Artaxerxes king of the Persians: and the epistle of the accusation was writen in Syriake, and was read in the Syrian language. <sup>8</sup> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai scribe wrote one epistle from Ierusalem to Artaxerxes the king, of this tenour: <sup>9</sup> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai scribe, and the rest of their counselers, the Dineites, and the Apharsathaceites, the Terphalcites, the Apharsites, the Erchuites, the Babylonians, the Susanecheites, the Dieuites, and the Aelamites, <sup>10</sup> and the rest of the Gentiles, which Asenaphar the great and glorious transported: and made them dwel in the cities of Samaria, and in the rest of the countries beyond the Riuer in peace: <sup>11</sup> (this is the copie of the epistle, which they sent to him) To Artaxerxes the king, thy seruantes, the men that are beyond the Riuer, send greeting. <sup>12</sup> Be it knowen to the king, that the Iewes, which came vp from thee to vs, are come into Ierusalem
