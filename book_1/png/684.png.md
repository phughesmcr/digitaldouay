Moreover with Absalom there went two hundred men out of Ierusalem being called, going with a simple hart, and vtterly ignorant of the cause. <sup>12</sup> Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, Dauids counseler, from his citie Gilo. And when he immolated victimes, there was made a strong conspiracie, and the people running together increased with Absalom. <sup>13</sup> A messenger therefore came to Dauid, saying: Al Israel with al their hart foloweth Absalom. <sup>14</sup> And Dauid said to his seruantes, that were with him in Ierusalem: Arise let vs flee: for there wil be no escape for vs from the face of Absolom: make hast to goe out, lest coming perhaps he ouertake vs, and force ruine vpon vs, and strike the citie in the edge of the sword. <sup>15</sup> And the kinges seruantes said to him: al thinges whatsoeuer our lord the king shal command, we thy seruantes wil gladly execute. <sup>16</sup> The king therefore went forth, and al his house on foote: & the king leift ten wemen his concubines to keepe the house. <sup>17</sup> And the king going forth & al Israel on their feete, stoode farre from the house: <sup>18</sup> and al his seruantes walked by him, and the legions Cerethi, and Phelethi and al the Getheites, valiant warriers, six hundred men which had folowed him from Geth footemen, went before the king. <sup>19</sup> And the king said to Ethai the Getheite: Why comest thou with vs? returne and dwel with the king, because thou art a stranger, and art come forth out of thy place. <sup>20</sup> Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to goe forth with vs? but I wil goe whither I shal goe: returne, and leade backe thy brethren with thee, and our Lord wil doe with thee mercie, and veritie, because thou hast shewed grace and fidelitie. <sup>21</sup> And Ethai answered the king, saying: The Lord liueth, and my lord the king liueth: for that in what place soeuer thou shalt be, my lord king, either in death, or in life, there wil thy seruant be. <sup>22</sup> And Dauid said to Ethai: Come, and passe. And Ethai the Getheite passed, and al the men that were with him, and the rest of the multitude. <sup>23</sup> And they al wept with a lowd voice, and al the people passed: the king also went ouer the Torrent Cedron, and al the people marched against the way, that looketh to the desert. <sup>24</sup> And Sadoc also the priest came, and al the Leuites with him carying the arke of the couenant of God, and they sette downe the arke of God: & Abiathar ascended, til al the people was fully passed,
