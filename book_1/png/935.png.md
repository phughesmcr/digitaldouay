<sup>14</sup> And the men of warre diuided the pray, & al the thinges that they had taken, before the princes and al the multitude. <sup>15</sup> And the men, whom we mentioned aboue, stood and taking the captiues, and al that were naked they clothed and shod them, with the spoyles: and when they had clothed and refreshed them with meate and drinke, and annoynted them because of their labour, and had looked carefully to them: as manie as could not walke, and were of a weake bodie, they set on beastes, and brought them to Iericho the Citie of palme trees to their brethren, and they returned into Samaria.

<sup>16</sup> At that time king Achaz sent to the king of the Assyrians asking helpe. <sup>17</sup> And the Idumeans came and stroke manie of Iuda, and tooke a great praye. <sup>18</sup> The Philisthijms also were spred abroad by the cities of the champayne, and toward the South of Iuda: and they tooke Bethsames, & Aialon, and Gaderoth, Socho also, & Thamnan, and Gamzo, with their villages, and dwelt in them. <sup>19</sup> For our Lord had humbled Iuda because of Achaz the king of Iuda, for that he had made it naked of helpe, and had contemned our Lord. <sup>20</sup> And he brought agaynst him Theglathphalnasar the king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him, and spoyled him no man resisting. <sup>21</sup> Therfore Achaz spoyling the house of our Lord, and the house of the kinges, and of the princes gaue giftes to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it did nothing profite him.

<sup>22</sup> Moreouer also in the time of his distresse he increased contempte agaynst our Lord, king Achaz himself by himself, <sup>23</sup> immolated victimes to the goddes of Damascus that stroke him, and sayd: The goddes of the kinges of Syria doe helpe them, whom I wil pacifie with hostes, and they wil ayde me, wheras on the contrarie part they were his ruine, and al Israels. <sup>24</sup> Achaz therefore hauing spoyled al the vessels of the house of God, and broken them shut the gates of the temple of God, and made him altars in al the corners of Ierusalem. <sup>25</sup> In al the cities also of Iuda he built altars to burne frankincense, and he prouoked to wrath our Lord the God of his fathers. <sup>26</sup> But the rest of his wordes, al his workes the first and the last are writen in the Booke of the kinges of Iuda and Israel. <sup>27</sup> And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the Citie of Ierusalem: for they receiued him not into the sepulchres of the kinges of Israel. And Ezechias his sonne reigned for him.
