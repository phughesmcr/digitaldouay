Abimelech and the inhabitantes of Sichem: Who began to detest him, <sup>24</sup> and to lay the wickednes of the murdering of the seuentie sonnes of Ierobaal, and the sheading of their bloud vpon Abimelech their brother, and vpon the rest of the princes of the Sichimites, that had holpen him. <sup>25</sup> And they sette an ambushment against him on the toppe of the mountaines: and whiles they taryed for his coming, they committed robberies, taking prayes of them that passed by: and it was told Abimelech. <sup>26</sup> And Gaal the sonne of Obed came with his brethren, and passed into Sichem. At whose coming the inhabitantes of Sichem taking courage, <sup>27</sup> issued forth into the fieldes, wasting the vineyardes, and treading the grapes: and gathering companies of musicions went into the temple of their god, and in their bankettes and cuppes cursed Abimelech, <sup>28</sup> Gaal the sonne of Obed crying: Who is Abimelech, and what is Sichem, that we should serue him? Is he not the sonne of Ierobaal, and hath made Zebul his seruant prince ouer the men of Emor the father of Sichem?

To whom he answered: Thou seest the shadowes of the mountaines as it were heades of men, and with this errour thou art deceiued. <sup>37</sup> Againe Gaal said: Behold there cometh downe people from the nauel of the land, and one trouppe cometh by the way, that
