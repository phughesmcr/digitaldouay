<sup>23</sup> with the mind of prevarication we have erected this altar, let him not keepe vs, but punish vs presently: and if we did it with that minde, that we might lay vpon it holocaustes, and sacrifice, and pacifique victimes, let him selfe examine it and iudge: <sup>24</sup> and not rather with that meaning and deliberation, that we said: To morrow your children wil say to our children: What haue you to doe with our Lord the God of Israel? <sup>25</sup> Our Lord hath put a border betwen vs and you, O ye children of Ruben, and children of Gad, the riuer Iordan: and therfore you haue no part in our Lord. And by this occasion your children shal auert our children from the feare of our Lord. We therfore thought it better, <sup>26</sup> and said: Let vs build vs an altar, not for holocaustes, nor to offer victimes, <sup>27</sup> but for a testimonie betwen vs and you, and our issue and your progenie, that we may serue our Lord, and it may be our right to offer both holocaustes, and victimes, and pacifique hostes: and that your children to morrow say not to our children: You haue no part in our Lord. <sup>28</sup> And if they wil say so, they shal answer them: Behold the altar of our Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocaustes, nor for sacrifice, but for our testimonie and yours. <sup>29</sup> God saue vs from this abomination that we should reuolt from our Lord, and leaue his steppes, erecting an altar to offer holocaustes, and sacrifices, and victimes, beside the altar of our Lord God, which is erected before his tabernacle. <sup>30</sup> Which thinges being heard, Phinees the priest, and the princes of the legacie, which were with him, were pacified: and they admitted most willingly the wordes of the children of Ruben, & Gad, and of the halfe tribe of Manasses. <sup>31</sup> And Phinees the priest the sonne of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that our Lord is with vs, because you are not culpable of this prevarication, and haue deliuered the children of Israel from the hand of our Lord. <sup>32</sup> And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the Land of Galaad, into the Land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and reported to them. <sup>33</sup> And the saying pleased al that heard it. And the children of Israel praysed God, and they did no more say, that they would goe vp against them, and fight, and destroy the Land of their possession. <sup>34</sup> And the children of Ruben, & the children of Gad called the altar, which they had built, Our testimonie, that our Lord he is God.

<aside>In the law of Moyses was one onlie altar for sacrifice, for the whole people of God, to auoide schisme and idolatrie. Now in the Church (being in al nations) are manie altares, & but one Sacrifice prefigured by al the former.</aside>
