Samuel. Saul.

called Saul in the high chaber, saying: Arise that I may dismisse
thee. And Saul arose: and they went both forth: to witte, he
and Samuel. <sup>27</sup> And when they came downe in the vttermost
part of the citie, Samuel said to Saul: Speake to the seruant
that he goe before vs, and passe: but stay thou alitle while,
that I may tel thee the word of our Lord.

CHAP. X.

*Saul is annointed king, and confirmed by signes that his ordinance is of God.
10. He prophecie-th, which the people doth admire. 17. Samuel calleth the
people together, for appointing a king, the lotte falleth on Saul. 25. And the
law of the king is againe mentioned.*

<sup>1</sup> And Samuel tooke a litle vessel of oyle, and powred
vpon his head, and kissed him, and sayd: Behold, our
Lord hath annointed thee vpon his inheritance to be prince,
and thou shalt deliuer his people out of the handes of their
enemies, that are round about them. And this shal be a signe
vnto thee, that God hath annointed thee to be prince. <sup>2</sup> When
thou shalt be departed from me this day, thou shalt finde two
men beside the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benia-
min, in the South, and they shal say to thee: The asses are
found, which thou dist goe to seeke: and thy father letting
goe the asses, is careful for you, and sayeth: What shal I doe
concerning my sonne? <sup>3</sup> And when thou shalt depart thence,
and passe farder, and shalt come to the oke Thabor, three
men going vp to God into Bethel shal finde thee there, one
carying three kiddes, and an other three manchettes of bread,
and an other carying a flagon of wine. <sup>4</sup> And when they
haue saluted thee, they wil geue thee two loaues, and thou
shalt take them of their hand. <sup>5</sup> After these thinges thou
shalt come into the hil of God, where the garrison of the
Philisthiimes is: and when thou shalt be entered there into
the citie, thou shalt meete there a flocke of prophetes co-
ming downe from the excelse, and before them psalterie and
tymbre, and fluite, and harpe, and themselues prophe-
cying. <sup>6</sup> And the Spirit of our Lord shal seaze vpon thee,
and thou shalt prophecie with them, and shalt be changed
into an other man. <sup>7</sup> Thefore when al these signes shal
chance to thee, doe whatsoeuer thy hand shal finde, because
our Lord is with thee. <sup>8</sup> And thou shalt goe downe before
me into Galgala (for I wil come downe to thee) that thou
mayest
