and approching to the doore, endeuoured to put fire vnder it: <sup>53</sup> and behold one woman casting from aboue a peece of a milstone, dashed it against the head of Abimelech, and brake his brayne. <sup>54</sup> Who called by and by his esquire, and said to him: Draw out thy sword, and strike me: lest perhaps it be said that I was slaine of a woman. Who doing as he was commanded slew him. <sup>55</sup> And when he was dead, al that were with him of Israel, returned into their seates: <sup>56</sup> and God repayed the euil, that Abimelech had done against his father, killing his seuentie brethren. <sup>57</sup> The Sichemites were also rewarded for that which they had wrought, and the curse of Ioatham the sonne of Ierobaal came vpon them.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. IX.

[^1] *The trees went to annoint a king.*] According to the historie Ioatham Gedeons youngest sonne, by a parable iustly expostulated the iniurie donne by the Sichemites to his fathers house, in preferring a base bound womans sonne, and cruelly murdering the rest of his sonnes: who with much trauail, and manie dangers of his owne life, had deliuered them from seruitude. But in the spiritual sense, which (as the ancient fathers note) is chiefly intended, Idolaters and Heretikes are reproued, who rather accept of vniust vsurpers, that wil serue their licentious appetites, and maintaine vice and wickednes, then to be ruled by iust and lawful Superiors, appointed by Gods ordinance, indued with grace of the Holie Ghost (signified by *the oliue tree*;) such as bring forth wholsome swete vertues (signified by *the figge tree*;) and are replenished with admirable fortitude (signified by the vine tree:) and in their places set vp base, ambitious, cruel, and crabbed princes, signified by the bramble, or brere. Thus Nemrod, Abimelech, Mahomet, and innumerable other tyrants haue benne aduanced, & especially Antichrist *that be extolled aboue al that is called God, or is worshipped*, and shal most cruelly persecute al Chatholiques, that wil not conforme them selues to his proceedings. But in fine (as here is prefigured in Abimelech) *fire shal rise against this bramble Antichrist, and shal deuoure him and al his together*. S. Beda. *q.* *in lib. Iudic. c. 6.*
