Nehemias.

<sup>11</sup> And I assembled them, and I made them to stand in their standings. <sup>12</sup> And al Iuda caried the tythe of the corne, wine, and oyle into the store houses. <sup>13</sup> And we appoynted ouer the store-houses Selemias Priest, and Sadoc scribe, and Phadaia of the Leuites, and next to them, Hanan the sonne of Zachur, the sonne of Mathanias: because they were approued faithful, and to them were committed the portions of the bretheren. <sup>14</sup> Remember me my God for this thing, and wipe not out my mercies, which I haue done in the house of my God, and in his ceremonies. <sup>15</sup> In those daies I saw them in Iuda treading the presses on the Sabbath, carying heapes, and loding vpon asses wine, and grapes, and figges, and al maner of burthen, and bringing it into Ierusalem on the Sabbath day.
