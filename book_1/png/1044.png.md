tians, when they ran armed after thy seruantes, trusting in chariotes, and in their horsemen, and in a multitude of men of warre. <sup>7</sup> But thou didst looke ouer their campe, and darke- nesse wearied them. <sup>8</sup> The depth held their feete, and the waters ouerwhelmed them. <sup>9</sup> So let these also be made ô Lord, which trust in their multitude, and in their chariotes, and in pikes, and in shieldes, and in their arrowes, and glorie in their speares, <sup>10</sup> and know not thy self art our God, which destroyest warres from the beginning, and Lord is thy name. <sup>11</sup> Lift vp thyne arme as from the beginning, and dash their power in thy power: let their power fal in thy wrath, which promise that they wil violate thy holie thinges, and pollute the tabernacle of thy holie name, & with their sword throw downe the horne of thyne altar. <sup>12</sup> Bring to passe Lord, that his pride be cut of with his owne sword, <sup>13</sup> let him be caught with the snares of his eies in me, and thou shalt strike him from the lippes of my charitie. <sup>14</sup> Geue me constancie in mind, that I may contemne him: and powre that I may ouerthrow him. <sup>15</sup> For this shal be a memorial of thy name, when the hand of a woman shal ouerthrow him. <sup>16</sup> For not in multitude is thy power ô Lord, neither in strength of horses is thy wil, neither haue the proud pleased thee from the beginninge: but the prayer of the humble and meeke hath alwayes pleased thee. <sup>17</sup> God of the heauens, creatour of the waters, and Lord of euerie creature, heare me wretch, praying and presuming of thy mercie. <sup>18</sup> Remember Lord thy testament, and geue a word in my mouth, and strengthen counsel in my hart, that thy house may continew in thy sanctification: <sup>19</sup> and al Nations may acknowledge, that thou art God, and there is no other besides thee.
