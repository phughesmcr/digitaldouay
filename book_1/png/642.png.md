appointment, his men with wordes, and permitted them not to rise against
Saul: moreouer Saul rising out of the caue, went on his iour-
ney begunne. <sup>9</sup> And Dauid rose vp after him: and going out
of the caue, cried behind Sauls backe, saying: My Lord King.
And Saul looked backe behind him: and Dauid bowing him
selfe flat toward the ground adored, <sup>10</sup> and sayd to Saul: Why
doest thou heare the wordes of men that say: Dauid seeketh
euil against thee? <sup>11</sup> Loe this day thyne eies haue seene, that
our Lord deliuered thee in my hand, in the caue, and I had a
cogitation to kil thee, but myn eie hath spared thee. For I
sayd: I wil not extend myn hand vpon my lord, because he is
the annointed of our Lord. <sup>12</sup> But rather see and knowe, o
my father, the hemme of thy cloke in my hand, that when I
did cut of the hemme of thy cloke, I would not extend my
hand vpon thee. Marke, and see, that there is no euil in my
hand, nor iniquitie, neither haue I sinned against thee: but
thou lyest in waite for my life, to take it away. <sup>13</sup> Our Lord
iudge betwen me and thee, and our Lord reuenge me of thee,
but be not my hand vpon thee. <sup>14</sup> As also it is sayd in the old
prouerbe: FROM THE IMPIOVS shal impietie procede: be not
therefore my hand vpon thee: Whom doest thou persecute O
King of Israel? <sup>15</sup> Whom doest thou persecute? thou persecu-
test a dead dog, and a flea. <sup>16</sup> Our Lord be iudge, & iudge bet-
wen me and thee, and he see, and iudge my cause, and deliuer
me out of thy hand. <sup>17</sup> And when Dauid had fully ended spea-
king such wordes to Saul, Saul sayd: Is this thy voice my sonne
Dauid? and Saul lifted vp his voice, and wept: <sup>18</sup> and sayd to
Dauid: Thou art iuster then I: for thou hast done me good
turnes, and I haue rendred thee euil. <sup>19</sup> And thou hast shewed
this day what good thinges thou hast done to me: how our
Lord deliuered me into thy hande and thou hast not killed
me. <sup>20</sup> For who when he hath found his enemie, wil let him
goe in a good way? But our Lord render thee this good turne,
for that which thou hast wrought toward me this day. <sup>21</sup> And
now because I knowe that thou most certeinly shalt reigne,
and haue the kingdome of Israel in thy hand: <sup>22</sup> sweare to me
in our Lord, not to destroy my seede after me, nor to take
away my name from the house of my father. <sup>23</sup> And Dauid
sware to Saul. Saul therefore went into his house: and Dauid
and his men went vp into safer places.

<aside>Dauid's appointment, could not law-fully be slaine by his subiec-tes without like ordinance from God. For though Dauid was also alrea-dy annointed, yet that was not to reigne presently, but when Saul should die, or otherwise be taken away.</aside>
