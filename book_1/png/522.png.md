## CHAP. XVIII.

From the campe of Israel in Silo surveyors are sent to divide the rest of the Land into seven partes, for the seven tribes yet without portions. 10. Which being donne, Iosue casteth lottes for them, 11. and the first lotte falleth to Beniamin, 12. whose part is described by the limites, 21. with the names of the principal cities.

AND al the children of Israel were assembled in Silo, and there they pitched the tabernacle of the testimonie, and the Land was subdewed to them. <sup>2</sup> But there remained seven tribes of the children of Israel, which as yet had not received their possessions. <sup>3</sup> To whom Iosue said: How long are you slack with cowardenes, and enter not to possesse the Land, which our Lord the God of your fathers hath geuen you? <sup>4</sup> Choose of euerie tribe three men, that I may send them, and they may goe and circuite the Land, and marke it out according to the number[^1] of euerie multitude: and report vnto me that which they haue marked out. <sup>5</sup> Diuide vnto you the Land into seuen partes: let Iudas be in his boundes on the south quarter, and the house of Ioseph on the North. <sup>6</sup> the Land in the middes betwen these marke out into seuen partes: and you shal come hither to me, that before our Lord your God I may cast the lotte for you: <sup>7</sup> for the Leuites part is not among you, but the priesthod of our Lord is their inheritance. And Gad and Ruben, and the halfe tribe of Manasses had now receiued their possessions beyond Iordan at the East side: which Moyses the seruant of our Lord gaue them. <sup>8</sup> And when the men were rysen vp, that they might goe to marke out the land, Iosue commanded them, saying: Circuite the Land and marke it out, and returne to me: that here before our Lord, in Silo I may cast the lotte for you <sup>9</sup> They therfore went on: and going ouer it, diuided it into seuen partes, writing it in a volume. And they returned to Iosue into the campe in Silo. <sup>10</sup> Who did cast lottes before our Lord in Silo, and diuided the Land to the children of Israel into seuen partes. <sup>11</sup> And first came vp the lotte of the children of Beniamin by their families, to possesse the Land betwen the children of Iudas and the children of Ioseph. <sup>12</sup> And their border was against the North from Iordan: going forward by the side of Iericho on the north quarter, and thence Westward rysing vp vnto the mountaines:

[^1]: :: Not equal but proportionable partes were assigned, for so it was commanded. Num. 26. v. 54. To the greater number to geue a greater portion, and to the fewer a lesse.

<aside>:: After the portions were appointed by men industrie & discretion, God confirmed the same by lotte, to take away al occasion of discontentment.</aside>
