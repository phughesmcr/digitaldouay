<sup>11</sup>throat. The eare hearing counted me blessed, and the eie

<sup>12</sup>seing gaue testimonie to me: For that I had deliuered the
poore man crying out, and the pupil, that had no helper.

<sup>13</sup>The blessing of him that was readie to perish came vpon
me, and I conforted the hart of the widow.

<sup>14</sup>I was clothed
with iustice: and I reuested me with my iudgement, as with

<sup>15</sup>a garment and crowne.

<sup>16</sup>I was an eie to the blind, and a foote
to the lame.

<sup>17</sup>I was the father of the poore: and the cause
which I knew not, I searched most diligently.

<sup>18</sup>I brake the
iawes of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I tooke away
the praye.

<sup>19</sup>And I said: I wil die in my litle nest, & as a palme-
tree wil multiplie daies.

<sup>20</sup>My roote is opened beside the wa-
ters, and dewe shal continue in my haruest.

<sup>21</sup>My glorie shal
alwaies be renewed, and my bow in my hand shal be repay-
red.

<sup>22</sup>They that heard me, expected sentence, and attent
held their peace at my counsel.

<sup>23</sup>To my wordes they durst
adde nothing, and my speach distilled vpon them.

<sup>24</sup>They
expected me as rayne, and they opened their mouth as it were
to a lateward shower.

<sup>25</sup>If at anie time I laughed on them,
they beleued not, and the light of my countenance fel not on
the earth.

<sup>26</sup>If I would haue gone to them, I sate first, and
when I sate as a king, with his armie standing about him,
yet was I a conforter of them that mourned.

CHAP. XXX.

*Holie Iob sheweth the great change of his temporal estate, from welfare into
great calamitie.*

<sup>1</sup>BVT now they of yonger time scorne me, whose fathers
I vouchsafed not to put with the dogs of my flocke:

<sup>2</sup>The force of whose handes was to me as nothing, and they
were thought vnworthie of life itself.

<sup>3</sup>Barren with pouer-
tie and famine, who gnawed in the wildernes, il fauoured by
calamitie and miserie.

<sup>4</sup>And they did eate grasse, and the bar-
kes of trees, and the roote of iunipers was their meat.

<sup>5</sup>Who
taking these thinges violently out of the valles, when they
had found euerie thing, they ranne to them with a crie.

<sup>6</sup>They dwelt in the deserts of torrentes, and in caues of the
earth, or vpon grauel.

<sup>7</sup>Who reioy≈øed among these kind
of thinges, and counted it delicacies to be vnder the briers.

<sup>8</sup>The children of foolish and base men, and in the earth
not appearing at al.

<sup>9</sup>Now am I turned into their song, and
