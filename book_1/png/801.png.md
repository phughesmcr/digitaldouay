Of Iuda: Ochozias of Isr. Iehu.

<sup>27</sup> But Ochozias the king of Iuda seing this, fled by the way of the house of the garden: and Iehu pursewed him, and said: This man also strike ye in his chariote. And they stroke him in the going vp of Gauer, which is beside Ieblaam: who fled into Mageddo, and died there. <sup>28</sup> And his seruantes layd him vpon his chariote, and caried him into Ierusalem: and they buried him there in his sepulchre with his fathers in the Citie of Dauid. <sup>29</sup> In the eleuenth yeare of Ioram the sonne of Achab, reigned Ochozias ouer Iuda, <sup>30</sup> and Iehu came into Iezrahel. Moreouer Iezabel hearing of his entrance, paynted her face with stibicke stone, and decked her head, and beheld through the window <sup>31</sup> Iehu coming at the gate, and sayd: Can there be peace to Zambri, that killed his maister? <sup>32</sup> And Iehu lifted vp his face to the window, and sayd: What is she? And two or three eunuches bowed them selues to him. <sup>33</sup> But he sayd to them: Cast her downe headlong, & they threw her downe and the wal was sprinkled with the bloud, and the hoofes of the horses trode her. <sup>34</sup> And when he was entered in, to eate, and to drinke, he sayd: Goe, and see that cursed woman, and burie her: because she is a kinges daughter. <sup>35</sup> And when they went to burie her, they found nothing but the skul, and the feete, and the extreme partes of the handes. <sup>36</sup> And returning they told him. And Iehu sayd: It is the word of our Lord, which he spake by his seruant Elias the Thesbite, saying: In the field of Iezrahel shal the dogges eate the flesh of Iezabel, <sup>37</sup> and the flesh of Iezabel shal be as dung vpon the face of the earth in the field of Iezrahel, so that they which passe by shal say: Is this that same Iezabel?
