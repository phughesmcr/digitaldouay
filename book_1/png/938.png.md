Leuites stoode, holding the instrumentes of Dauid, and the
Priestes trumpettes. <sup>27</sup> And Ezechias commanded that they
should offer holocaustes vpon the altar: and when holocaustes were offered, they began to sing prayses to our Lord,
and to sound with trumpettes, and on diuerse instrumentes,
which Dauid the king of Israel had prepared for to sound.
<sup>28</sup> And al the multitude adoring, the singing men, and they
that held the trumpettes, were in their office, whiles the holocaust was accomplished. <sup>29</sup> And when the oblation was
ended, the king bowed, and al that were with him, and adored. <sup>30</sup> And Ezechias, and the princes commanded the Leuites, that they should prayse our Lord in the wordes of Dauid,
and Asaph the Seer: who praysed him with great ioy, and
bowing the knee adored. <sup>31</sup> But Ezechias added these wordes
also: You haue filled your handes to our Lord, come, and
offer victimes, and prayses in the house of our Lord. Al the
multitude therfore offered hostes, and prayses, and holocaustes with a deuout minde. <sup>32</sup> Moreouer the number of
the holocaustes, which the multitude offered, was this, oxen
seuentie, rammes an hundred, lambes two hundred. <sup>33</sup> And
they sanctified to our Lord oxen six hunered, & sheepe three
thousand. <sup>34</sup> But the Priestes were few, neither could they
suffise to draw of the skinnes of the holocaustes: wherefore
the Leuites also their brethren holpe them, til the worke
was accomplished, and the Priestes were sanctified, for the
Leuites are sanctified with an easier rite, then the Priestes.
<sup>35</sup> There were holocaustes therfore verie many, the fatte of
pacifiques, and the libamentes of the holocaustes: and the
seruice of the house of our Lord was accomplished. <sup>36</sup> And
Ezechias reioyced, and al the people, because the ministerie
of our Lord was accomplished. For it pleased them that the
thing should be done of a soden.
