Church and Religion.

mentes: for this is euerie man (or, *to this end man is created*) and
God wil bring, into Iudgement al thinges, that are done, for
euerie errour (*or obscure thing*) whether it be good or euil.

Neither were these and other pointes of Faith and Religion interrupted, but stil beleued and professed in the Church alwaies visible and
incontaminate, notwithstanding some boughes and branches became vnfructful, and rotten: others brake of and were separated from the vine.
For when Salomon falling to luxurie, multiplying manie wiues and concubines, was by them seduced and brought to spiritual fornication, and
idolatrie, making altars, & offering sacrifices to Idoles, the Priestes,
Prophetes, and people generally perseured in Gods law & seruice.
<sup>3</sup>. Reg. 11. *For whose death* Ieroboam his seruant, of the tribe of Ephraim, possessing Tenne Tribes (*called the kingdom of Israel*) to maintaine his new state, fearing that if the people returned to Ierusalem, for religions sake, they would depart from him, and returne to the right heyres of
Dauid and Salomon, made an egregious Schisme, setting vp two
golden calues in Bethel, and Dan. <sup>3</sup>. Reg. 12. made temples, altares,
and priestes to serue them, al opposite to Gods ordinance. But not only the
other Two Tribes, called the kingdom of Iuda, but also the greatest part
of Israel, especially Priestes, Leuites, and deuoutest people, repayred
stil to Ierusalem, not yelding to that schisme and idolatrie. 1. Par. 11.
Moreouer God raised vp and sent special Prophetes, to confirme the weake
and recal the seduced.

For Ieroboam had no sooner set vp his new altar in Bethel, and begunne
to offer incense vpon it, but a Prophet came out of Iuda, in the word
of our Lord: and cried against that altar, foretelling that wheras for that
present, they burnt frankincense vpon it, the time should come, when the false
priestes should be burned there, confirming by present miracles that which
he vttered in wordes, the kings hand suddainly withering, & restored
againe by the prophets prayer, and the new altar cleuing in sunder, that
the ashes fel out. <sup>3</sup>. Reg. 13. Further an other Prophet called Ahias foreshewed the destruction and vtter extirpation of Ieroboams familie, for his
enormous wickednes, and namely (*which is most often inculcate*) for making Israel to sinne, by deuising and setting abroch a new religion. <sup>3</sup>. Reg.
14. which ruine happened very shortly. For himself reigning twentie two yeares
(<sup>3</sup>. Reg. 14.) one of his sonnes died presently according to the Prophets
word. v. 18. An other called Nadab succeding to his father, reigned only
two yeares, and was slaine together with their whole race and kindred,
by Baasa of the tribe of Issachar. <sup>3</sup>. Reg. 15. Likewise Baasa folowing the
bad steppes of Ieroboam was forewarned by Iehu a Prophet, that his house
should also be destroyed. And accordingly when he had reigned foure and
