<sup>18</sup> God that begatte thee thou hast forsaken, and hast forgotten our Lord thy creatour.

<sup>19</sup> Our Lord saw, and was moued to wrath: because his sonnes and daughters prouoked him.

<sup>20</sup> And he said: I wil hide my face from them, and wil consider their last: for it is a peruerse generation, and vnfaithful children.

<sup>21</sup> They haue prouoked me in that, which was no God, and haue angred me in their vanities: and I wil prouoke them in that, which is no people, and in a foolish nation wil I anger them.

<sup>22</sup> A fyre is kindled in my wrath, and shal burne euen to the lowest partes of hel: and shal deuoure the earth with her spring, and shal burne the foundations of mountaines.

<sup>23</sup> I wil heape euils vpon them, and myne arrowes I wil spend in them.

<sup>24</sup> They shal be consumed with famine, and birdes shal deuoure them with most bitter biting: the teeth of beastes wil I send vpon them, with the furie of those that traile vpon the ground, and crepe.

<sup>25</sup> Without shal the sword deuoure them, & within fearefulnes, the young man and the virgin together, the sucking child with the old man.

<sup>26</sup> I said: Where are they? I wil make their memorie to cease from among men.

<sup>27</sup> But for the wrath of the enemies I haue differred: lest perhaps their enemies might be proude, and would say: Our mightie hand, and not the Lord, hath done al these thinges.

<sup>28</sup> A nation without counsel is it, and without wisdome.

<sup>29</sup> O that they were wise, and vnderstoode, and would prouide for their last.

<sup>30</sup> How should one pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight? was it not therefore, because their God sold them, and our Lord inclosed them?

<sup>31</sup> For our Lord is not as their goddes: our enemies also are iudges.

<sup>32</sup> Of the vineyard of Sodom, is their vineyard, and of the suburbes of Gomorrha: their grape the grape of gall, and the clusters most bitter.

<sup>33</sup> The gall of dragons their wine, and the venime of Aspes vncurable.

<aside>m. For their peruersenes God withdrawes his helpe from them.</aside>

<aside>n. God first loueth, before anie man loueth him, but men first forsake God, before he forsake them.</aside>

<aside>o. The Iewes reputed most Gentiles foolish yet now they are inferior to al.</aside>

[^1]: p. For iust causes God some times differreth punish-ment.

[^2]: q. True wisdome considereth thinges past, vnderstandeth things present, and prouideth for thinges to come.

[^3]: r. Al infideles confesse more blasphemie in the true God and in his Religion, then in their owne.
