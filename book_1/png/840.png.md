## ANNOTATIONS.

Because in diuers holie Scriptures, and especialy in these bookes of Paralipo-
menon, manie difficulties occurre concerning diuers persons, and places; as also
differences of numbers, and times; in reconciling wherof the holie Fathers and
Doctors haue much laboured, making sometimes large commentaries to satis-
fie them selues, and other diligent searchers of the truth, & to remoue the oblo-
quies of detractors from the authoritie of holie Scripture, whose learned ex-
plications of such obscurities if we should cite, it would be ouer long, and
contrarie to our purpose of brief Annotations; here once for often, we wil
present to the vulgar reader, certaine cleare and ordinarie rules, by which
the learned Diuines do reconcile such apparent contradictions.

First, it is euident by sundrie examples, that manie persons, places, and some
other thinges had diuers names; & so are sometimes called by one name, some-
times by an other. Secondly (which is more common) manie were called by the
same names, and so must be distinguished by the differences of times, places,
qualities, or other circumstances. Thirdly, in genealogies and other histories,
children are not alwaies called the sonnes, or daughters of their natural
parentes, but sometimes of legal fathers; and sometimes also of those that
adopted them for their children; and sometimes of their grandfathers, or
former progenitors. Fourthly, sometime for mysterie sake, an other num-
ber is expressed, being true in the mystical sense, differing from the precise
number according to the historie. As in the genealogie of Christ the Euan-
gelist counteth thrise fourteen generations from Abraham to our Sauiour,
differing from the historie of the old Testament. Fiftly, euen in the historie it
self, sometimes holie Scripture counteth only the greater numbers, ommitting
the lesser, and in some other addeth also the odde numbers. Sixtly, the Scrip-
tures speake often by tropes, as mentioning part for the whole, or the whole
for the part; so by the figure Synechdoche, Christ is said to haue bene three
dayes dead, that is, one whole day and part of other two. And some king liuing
or reigning so manie yeares and part of an other, and his successour reigning
the other part, ech part is counted to each of them for a whole yeare, and so a
yeare is added, more then is in the precise number. Seuenthly, sometimes the
sonnes reigned together with their fathers, as Ioatham reigned his father Ozias
yet liuing. 4. Reg. 15. & so both their reignes are sometimes counted, sometimes
their seueral yeares, as if euerie one reigned alone. Eightly, the times of vacan-
ces, in the gouernment of the Iudges, reignes of kinges, and the like, are some-
times omitted in calculation, sometimes adioyned to the predecessor, or
successor. Ninthly, sometimes the holie Scripture mentioneth the only time that
one liued or reigned wel, as it were blotting out the rest with obliuion. So Saul
is sayd to haue reigned two yeares (1. Reg 13.) Who wel and euil reigned much
longer. Tenthly, By error in writing, wordes, names, and especially numbers
may easely be changed, and can not easely be corrected. By these or other like
meanes, al the holie Scriptures may be defended, though none ought to pre-

[^1]: Differences of names, numbers, & times, found in holie scriptures, make them hard to be vnderstood.
