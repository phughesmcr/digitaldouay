which was beside the wal, Ionathas arose, and Abner sate at the side of Saul, and Dauids place appeared voide. <sup>26</sup> And Saul sayd nothing that day, for he thought it had chanced perhaps vnto him, that he was not cleane, nor purified. <sup>27</sup> And when the second day was come after the calendes, againe Dauids place appeared emptie. And Saul said to Ionathas his sonne: Why came not the sonne of Isai neither yesterday, nor to day to eate? <sup>28</sup> Ionathas answered Saul: He desired me instantly, that he might goe into Bethlehem, <sup>29</sup> and he said: Let me goe, because there is a solemne sacrifice in the citie, one of my brethren hath sent for me: now therefore if I haue found grace in thy sight, I wil goe quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the kings table. <sup>30</sup> But Saul being wrath against Ionathas, said to him: Thou sonne of a woman which of her owne accord rauisheth a man, am I ignorant that thou louest the sonne of Isai vnto thyne owne confusion, and to the confusion of thyne ignominious mother? <sup>31</sup> For al the dayes, that the sonne of Isai shal liue vpon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom.

For he was stroken-heauie vpon Dauid, because his father had confounded him. <sup>35</sup> And when the morning appeared, Ionathas came into the field according to the appointment with Dauid, and a little boy with him. <sup>36</sup> and said to his boy: Goe, and fetch me the arrowes, which I shoote. And when the boy had runne, he shotte an other arrowe beyond the boy. <sup>37</sup> The boy therefore came to the place of the arrowe, which Ionathas had shotte: and Ionathas cried behind the back of the boy, and said: Loe the arrowe is there further beyond thee. <sup>38</sup> And Ionathas cried againe behind the back of the boy, saying: Make hast spedely, stand not. And Ionathas his boy gathered vp his arrowes, and brought them to his master: <sup>39</sup> and he was altogether ignorant, what was done: for only Ionathas and Dauid knew the matter. <sup>40</sup> Ionathas therefore gaue his armoure to the boy, and said to him: Goe, and cary them
