Who answered: Goe not vp against them, but fetch a compasse behind their backe, and thou shalt come to them ouer against the peare trees. <sup>14</sup> And when thou shalt heare the sound of one going in the toppe of the peare-trees, then shalt thou enter battel: because then wil our Lord goe forth before thy face, to strike the campe of the Philistijms. <sup>15</sup> David therefore did as our Lord had commanded him, and he stroke the Philistijms from Gabaa, vntil thou come to Gezer.
