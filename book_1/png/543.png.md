# Debbora and Barac.

## CHAP. IIII.

Against the people sinning are oppressed, and crying to God, 4. by direction of Debbora a prophetesse, Barac fighteth against Sisara their enemie. 15. Who stricken with feare, and fleeing away, 17. Iahel pretending his safetie killeth him in her house.

<sup>1</sup> AND the children of Israel added to doe euil in the sight <sup>2</sup> of our Lord after the death of Aod, and our Lord deliuered them into the handes of Iabin the king of Chanaan, which reigned in Asor: and he had a captaine of his armie <sup>3</sup> named Sisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of the gentiles. And the children of Israel cried to our Lord: for he had nine hundred yron hooked chariottes, and for twentie yeres had <sup>4</sup> vehemently oppressed them. And there was one Debbora a prophetesse the wife of Lapidoth, which iudged the people <sup>5</sup> at that time. And she sate vnder a palme tree, which was called by her name, betwen Rama and Bethel in the mount of Ephraim: and the children of Israel went vp to her for <sup>6</sup> al iudgement. Who sent, and called Barac the sonne of Abinoem of Cedes in Nepthali: and she said to him: Our Lord God of Israel hath commanded thee, Goe, and lead an armie into mount Thabor, and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting men of the children of Nepthali, and of <sup>7</sup> the children of Zabulon: and I wil bring vnto thee in the place of the Torrent Cison, Sisara the prince of the hoste of Iabin, and his chariotes, and al the multitude, and wil deliuer <sup>8</sup> them in thy hand. And Barac said to her: If thou come with me, I wil goe: If thou wilt not come with me, I wil <sup>9</sup> not goe. Who said to him: I wil goe in deede with thee, but at this time the victorie shal not be imputed to thee, because Sisara shal be deliuered into the hand of a woman. Debbora therfore arose, and went with Barac into Cedes. <sup>10</sup> Who calling vnto him Zabulon and Nepthali, went vp with ten thousand fighting men, hauing Debbora in his com- <sup>11</sup> panie. And Haber the Cineite was in time past departed from the rest of the Cineites his brethren of Hobab, the cosin of Moyses: and had pitched his tentes vnto the valley, which <sup>12</sup> is called Sennim, and was nere Cedes. And it was told <sup>13</sup> Sisara, that Barac the sonne of Abinoem was gone vp into mount Thabor: and he gathered nine hundred yron hooked chariottes, and al his armie from Haroseth of the gentiles

<aside>*: Being a prophetesse she resolued hard and obscure thinges, but exercised no iurisdiction in anie causes, for that belonged to the counsel of Priestes and of seuentie ancientes, where the high priest was the chief Iudge. *Num. 11.</aside>

[^1]: *Deut. 17.* Spiritually Debbora signified the Church & Barac christian Princes, who are directed in their warres, and other affaires by spiritual superiors, as Origen, and other ancient writers expound this historie.
