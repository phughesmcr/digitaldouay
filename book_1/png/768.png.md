They cried therefore with a loud voice, and cut them selues after their rite with kniues and lancers, til they were al embrewed with bloud. <sup>29</sup> And after the midday was past, and whiles they prophecied, the time was come, when they vsed to offer sacrifices, neither voice was heard, nor any did answer, nor attend them praying: <sup>30</sup> Elias sayd to al the people: Come vnto me. And the people coming to him, he repayred the altar of our Lord, that was destroyed. <sup>31</sup> And he tooke twelue stones according to the number of the tribes of the children of Iacob, to whom the word of our Lord came, saying: Israel shal be thy name. <sup>32</sup> And he built of the stones an altar in the name of our Lord: and he made a water gutter, as it were by two furrowes round about the altar, <sup>33</sup> and he layed the wood in order, and diuided the oxe in iointes, and layd it vpon the wood, <sup>34</sup> and said: Fil foure buckettes with water, and powre vpon the holocauste, and vpon the wood. And againe he sayd: Doe it also the second time. Who hauing donne it the second time, he said: The third time also doe the same. And they did so the third time, <sup>35</sup> and the waters ranne about the altar, and the trough of the conduite was filled. <sup>36</sup> And when it was now time that the holocauste should be offered, Elias the prophete coming said: Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, & Israel, shew this day that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy seruant, & that according to thy commandment I haue done al these thinges. <sup>37</sup> Heare me Lord, heare me: that this people may learne, that thou art our Lord God, & thou hast conuerted their hart againe. <sup>38</sup> And the fire of our Lord fel, & deuoured the holocauste, & the wood, and the stones, licking also the dust, and the water, that was in the water gutter. <sup>39</sup> Which when al the people had seene, they fel on their face, and said: Our Lord he is God, our Lord he is God. <sup>40</sup> And Elias said to them: Apprehend the prophetes of Baal, and let not one escape of them. Whom when they had taken, Elias brought them to the Torrent cison, and killed them there. <sup>41</sup> And Elias sayd to Achab: Goe vp, eate, and drinke: because there is found of much raine. <sup>42</sup> Achab went vp to eate and drinke: and Elias went vp into the toppe of Carmel, and flatte on the earth put his face betwen his knees, <sup>43</sup> and he said to his seruant: Goe vp, and looke toward the sea. Who when he was gone vp, and had looked, he said: There is nothing.
