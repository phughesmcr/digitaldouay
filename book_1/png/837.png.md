OF KINGES. 817

it came to passe in the seuenth moneth, there came Ismahel
the sonne of Nathanias, the sonne of Elisama of the kinges
seede, and ten men with him: and stroke Godolias, who also
died: yea the Iewes also & the Chaldees, that were with him
<sup>62</sup> in Maspha. And al the people rysing vp from litle to great,
& the capteynes of the souldiers, came into Ã†gypt fearing the
<sup>72</sup> Caldees. But it came to passe in the seuen and thirteth yeare
of the Transmigration of Ioachin the king of Iuda, in the
twelfth moneth, the seuen and twenteth day of the moneth:
Euilmerodach the king of Babylon, in the yeare, that he
began to reigne, :: lifted vp the head of Ioachin the king of
<sup>28</sup> Iuda out of prison. And he spake vnto him courteously:
and he sette his throne aboue the throne of the kinges, that
<sup>29</sup> were with him in Babylon. And he changed his garmentes,
which he had in the prison, and he did eate bread alwayes in
<sup>30</sup> his sight, al the dayes of his life. A certayne prouision also
he appointed for him without intermission, which was also
geuen him of the king day by day, al the daies of his life.

THE ARGVMENT OF
PARALIPOMENON.

PARALIPOMENON, *that is*, A supplement of thinges ommit-
ted, *called by the Hebrewes* Dibre haiamim, The wordes of the
dayes, *or* Chronicles, *is an Abridgement briefly shewing, besides diuers other
genealogies, from the beginning of the world, the faith and religion both of
the progenitors, and ofspring of the Patriarch Iacob, whose progenie God
chose and made his peculiar people; and in that nation more particularly re-
counting the Actes of king Dauid, and other kinges of his line, til they were
led captiue into Babylon*. A booke of such and so great importance
(sayeth S. Hierom.) as whosoever without it arrogateth the know-
ledge of Scriptures, may mocke himselfe. *The author is vncertaine,
but probably it semeth to be gathered by Esdras, out of other bookes and
traditions, for the perfecting of the old Testament: and is vndoubtedly
canonical Scripture. In hebrew it is al one booke, but being large, is with the
Greekes and Latines parted into two. And the first booke may be diuided
into three principal partes. The first nine chapters conteyne diuers genealogies,
first by the only right line from Adam to Noe, then by diuers lines of Noes
progenie, but most specially of Iacobs twelue sonnes. In the tenth chapter the
reiection, and death of king Saul is repeted. The other ninetene chapters are al
of Dauid; to wit, of his election to be king, and inunction, his vertues, his
faultes also, and his special actes, concerning Gods seruice, gouernment of the
people; and prouision made for building Gods Temple.*
