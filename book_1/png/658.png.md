of our Lord, and vpon the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword. <sup>13</sup> And Dauid said to the yong man that had told him: Whence art thou? Who answered: I am the sonne of a man a stranger of Amalec. <sup>14</sup> Dauid said to him: Why didst thou not feare to put to thy hand, to kil the annointed of our Lord? <sup>15</sup> And Dauid calling one of his seruants, said: Goe runne vpon him. Who stroke him, and he died. <sup>16</sup> And Dauid said to him: Thy bloud be vpon thine owne head: for thyn owne mouth hath spoken against thee, saying: I haue slaine the annointed of our Lord. <sup>17</sup> And Dauid mourned this kind of mourning vpon Saul, and vpon Ionathas his sonne, <sup>18</sup> (and he commanded that they should teach the children of Iuda the bowe, as it is written in the Booke of the iust.) And he said: Consider, o Israel for them that be dead wounded vpon thy high places. <sup>19</sup> The Nobles, o Israel, are slayne vpon thy mountaynes: how are the valiants fallen? <sup>20</sup> Tel it not in Geth, neither tel ye it in the high waies of Ascalon: lest perhaps the daughters of the Philisthijms be gladde, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised reioice. <sup>21</sup> Mountaines of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rayne come vpon you, neither be they fields of the first fruits: because there was the shield of the valiuntes cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he were not annointed with oyle. <sup>22</sup> From the bloud of the slaine, from the fatte of the valiants, the arrowe of Ionathas neuer returned backward, and the sword of Saul did not returne emptie. <sup>23</sup> Saul and Ionathas amiable, and comely in their life, in death also were not diuided: swifter then eagles, stronger then lyons. <sup>24</sup> Yee daughters of Israel weepe vpon Saul, who clothed you with scarlet in delicaces, who gaue golden ornaments to your attyre. <sup>25</sup> How haue the valiuntes fallen in battel? Ionathas bene slayne in thy high places? <sup>26</sup> I am sorie for thee my brother Ionathas exceeding beautiful, and amiable aboue the loue of wemen. As the mother loueth her onlie sonne, so did I loue thee. <sup>27</sup> How haue the strong fallen, and the weapons of warre perished?
