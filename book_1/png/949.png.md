<sup>24</sup> the man, that sent you to me: Thus sayth our Lord: Behold I wil bring euils vpon this place, and vpon the inhabitantes therof, and al the curses, that are writen in this Booke, which they redde before the king of Iuda. <sup>25</sup> Because they haue forsaken me, and haue sacrificed to strange goddes, that they might prouoke me to wrath in al the workes of their handes, therfore shal my furie droppe vpon this place, & shal not be extinguished. <sup>26</sup> But to the king of Iuda that sent you to beseche our Lord, thus speake ye: Thus sayth our Lord the God of Israel: Because thou hast heard the wordes of this volume, <sup>27</sup> and thy hart is mollified, and thou art humbled in the sight of our Lord for these thinges, which are spoken against this place, and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem, and reuerencing my face, hast rent thy garmentes, and wept before me: I also haue heard thee, sayth our Lord. <sup>28</sup> For now wil I gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be brought into thy graue in peace: neither shal thyne eies see al the euil that I wil bring in vpon this place, and vpon the inhabitantes therof. They therfore reported to the king al thinges that she had sayd. <sup>29</sup> But he calling together al the ancientes of Iuda and Ierusalem, <sup>30</sup> went vp into the house of our Lord, and al the men of Iuda, and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem, Priestes and Leuites, and al the people from the least to the greatest. In whose hearing in the house of our Lord, the king read al the wordes of the volume. <sup>31</sup> And standing on his tribunal seate, he made a couenant before our Lord, that he would walke after him, and keepe his preceptes, and testimonies, and iustifications in al his hart, and in al his soule, and would do the thinges that were writen in that volume, which he had read. <sup>32</sup> He adiured also vpon this al that were found in Ierusalem, and Beniamin: and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem did according to the couenant, of our Lord the God of their fathers. <sup>33</sup> Iosias therfore tooke away al abominations of al the countries of the children of Israel: and made al, that were left in Israel, to serue our Lord their God. Al his daies they reuolted not from our Lord the God of their fathers.
