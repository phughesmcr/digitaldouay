therefore sent Aduram, who was ouer the tributes: and al Is-
rael stoned him, and he died. moreouer King Roboam in hast
went vp into his chariote, and fled into Ierusalem: <sup>19</sup> and
Israel reuolted from the house of Dauid, vntil this present
day. <sup>20</sup> And it came to passe when al Israel had heard, that
Ieroboam was returned, they sent, and called him, an assem-
blie being gathered, and they made him king ouer al Israel,
neither did any man folow the house of Dauid beside the tribe
of Iuda onlie. <sup>21</sup> And Roboam came to Ierusalem, and gathe-
red together al the house of Iuda, and the tribe of Beniamin,
an hundred fourescore thousand chosen men warriers, to
fight agaynst the house of Israel, and to reduce the kingdom
to Roboam the sonne of Salomon. <sup>22</sup> But the word of our
Lord came to Semeias the man of God, saying: <sup>23</sup> Speake to
Roboam the sonne of Salomon, the king of Iuda, and to al
the house of Iuda, and Beniamin, and the rest of the people,
saying: <sup>24</sup> Thus sayth our Lord: You shal not goe vp, neither
shal you fight agaynst your brethren the children of Israel:
let euerie man returne into his house, for this word is done
by me. They heard the word of our Lord, and returned from
their iourney as our Lord had commanded them. <sup>25</sup> And Ie-
roboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there:
and departing thence he built Phanuel. <sup>26</sup> And Ieroboam
sayd in his hart: Now wil the kingdom returne to the house
of Dauid, <sup>27</sup> if this people shal goe vp to make sacrifices in
the house of our Lord into Ierusalem: and the hart of this
people wil be turned to their lord Roboam the king of Iuda,
and they wil kil me, and returne to him. <sup>28</sup> And finding out

a deuise he made two golden calues, and sayd to them: Goe
vp no more into Ierusalem: Behold thy goddes Israel, which
brought thee out of the Land of Ã†gypt. <sup>29</sup> And he put one in
Bethel, and the other in Dan: <sup>30</sup> and this thing was an occa-
sion of sinne: for the people went to adore the calfe, as farre
as Dan. <sup>31</sup> And he made temples in the excelfes, and priestes

of the abiectes of the people, which were not of the chil-
dren of Leui. <sup>32</sup> And he appoynted a solemne day in the eight
moneth, the fifteenth day of the moneth, after the similitude
of the solemnities, that was celebrated in Iuda. And going vp
he made in like maner an altar in Bethel, to immolate to
