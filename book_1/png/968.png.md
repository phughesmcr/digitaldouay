them: in feare, & they offered vpon it holocaust to our Lord morning and euening. <sup>4</sup> And they made the solemnitie of tabernacles, as it is writen, and holocaust euery day by order according to the pr√¶cept, the worke of the day in his day. <sup>5</sup> And after these thinges the continual holocaust, as wel in the Calendes, as in al the solemnities of our Lord, that were consecrated, and in al wherein there was offered voluntarily a gift to our Lord. <sup>6</sup> From the first day of the seuenth moneth they began to offer holocaust to our Lord: moreouer the temple of God was not yet founded. <sup>7</sup> And they gaue money to hewers of stones and to masons: meate also and drinke, and oyle to the Sidonians and Tyrians, that they should bring ceder trees from Libanus to the sea vnto Ioppe, according to that which Cyrus the king of the Persians had commanded them. <sup>8</sup> And in the second yeare of their coming to the temple of God in Ierusalem, the second moneth, began Zorobabel the sonne of Salathiel, and Iosue the sonne of Iosedec, and the rest of their brethren the Priestes, and the Leuites, and al that were come from the captiuitie into Ierusalem, and they appoynted Leuites from twentie yeares and vpward, that they should hasten forward the worke of our Lord. <sup>9</sup> And Iosue stood and his sonnes, and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sonnes, and the children of Iuda, as it were one man, that they might be instant vpon them, that did the worke in the temple of God: the sonnes of Henadad, and their sonnes, and their brethren Leuites. <sup>10</sup> The temple therfore of our Lord being founded by the masons, the Priestes stood in their attyre with trumpettes: and the Leuites the children of Asaph in cymbals, to prayse God by the handes of Dauid the king of Israel. <sup>11</sup> And they sang together in hymnes, and confession to our Lord: Because he is good, because his mercie is for euer vpon Israel. Al the people also made a shoute with a lowde crie in praysing our Lord, because the temple of our Lord was founded. <sup>12</sup> Verie manie also of the Priestes and the Leuites, and the princes of the fathers, & the ancients, that had seene the former temple: when they saw this temple founded, they wept with a lowd voyce: and manie shouting in ioy, lifted vp their voyce. <sup>13</sup> Neither could anie man discerne the voice of the crie of them that reioyced, and the voice of the weeping of the people: for one with an other the people showted with a lowd crie, and the voice was heard far of.
