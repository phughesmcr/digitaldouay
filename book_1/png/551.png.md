into the campe of Madian: and when it was come to the ta-
bernacle, it stroke it, and overthrew it, and beate it al flatte
with the earth. <sup>14</sup> He to whom he spake, answered: This
is no other thing, but the sword of Gedeon the sonne
of Ioas the man of Israel. For the Lord hath deliuered Ma-
dian into his handes, and al their campe. <sup>15</sup> And when
Gedeon had heard the dreame, and the interpretation therof,
he adored: and turned to the campe of Israel, and said: Arise
ye, for our Lord hath deliuered the campe of Madian into our
handes. <sup>16</sup> And he diuided the three hundred men into three
partes, and gaue them trumpettes in their handes, and
emptie pitchers, and lampes in the middes of their pitchers.
<sup>17</sup> And he said to them: What you shal see me doe, that doe
ye: I wil enter into part of the campe, and that which I shal
doe folow you. <sup>18</sup> When the trumpet shal sound in my hand,
doe you also sound and crie together round about the campe:
To our Lord and to Gedeon. <sup>19</sup> And Gedeon went in, and
the three hundred that were with him, into part of the campe,
the watch of midnight beginning, and raysing vp the watch
men they began to sound with their trumpettes, and to
clappe the pitchers one against an other. <sup>20</sup> And when they
sounded in three places round about the campe, and had
broken the pitchers, they held the lampes in the left handes,
and with the right they sounded the trumpettes, and cried:
The sword of our Lord and of Gedeon: <sup>21</sup> standing euerie
one in his place round about the enemies campe. Therfore
the whole campe was trubled, and crying out and howling
they fled: <sup>22</sup> and the three hundred men neuertheles per-
sisted sounding with the trumpettes. And our Lord sent in
the sword in al the campe, and they murdered one an other,
<sup>23</sup> fleeing as farre as Bethsetta, and the brinke of Abelmehula
in Tebbath. But the men of Israel of Nephthali, and Aser
shouting together, and al Manasses pursued Madian.
<sup>24</sup> And Gedeon sent messengers into al mount Ephraim,
saying: Come downe to meete Madian, and take the waters
before them to Bethbera and Iordan. And al Ephraim shou-
ted, and tooke the waters before them and Iordan vnto
Bethbera. <sup>25</sup> And two men that were apprehended of Madian,
Oreb, and Zeb: Oreb he slew in the Rocke of Oreb, Zeb in
the Presse of Zeb. And they pursued Madian, carying the
heades of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon beyond the streames
of Iordan.
