<sup>5</sup> came out of Egypt of the malekinde, al the fighting men, died in the desert by the long circuit of the way, who were al circumcised. But the people that was borne in the desert, <sup>6</sup> during the fourtie yeares of the iourney in the wide wildernes was incircumcised: til they were consumed that had not heard the voice of our Lord, and to whom he had sworne before, that he would not shew them a land flowing with milke and honie. <sup>7</sup> The children of these succeded in the place of the fathers, and were circumcised of Iosue: for they were in the prepuce euen as they were borne, neither had any circumcised them in the way. <sup>8</sup> And after that they were al circumcised, they abode in the same place of the campe, vntil they were whole; <sup>9</sup> And our Lord said to Iosue: This day haue I taken away the reproch of Egypt from you.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. V.

[^1] Iosue knowing that the person which appeared, was an Angel and not God, not a man, neither adored him with godlie honour, for that had bene idolatrie, nor with ciuil, for that pertaineth to wordlie and temporal excellencie, and is not competent to sacred thinges; especially to immortal and glorious spirites; and therfore the honour he did to this Angel, was religious honour infinitly inferior to diuine, and yet much greater then ciuil.

[^2] The Angel did not only accept of the honour donne vnto him, but also required more, shewing that the verie place was holie for his presence, being otherwise the common field of Iericho.
