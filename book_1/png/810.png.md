He did according to al thinges, which Ioas his father did: <sup>4</sup>but this onlie that he tooke not away the excelses: for yet the people immolated, and burnt incense in the excelses. <sup>5</sup>And when he obtayned the kingdom, he smote his seruantes, which had slaine the king his father: <sup>6</sup>but their children that killed him, he did not put to death, according to that which is written in the booke of the law of Moyses, as our Lord commanded, saying: The fathers shal not die for the children, neither shal the children die for the fathers: but euerie one shal die in his owne sinne. <sup>7</sup>He smote Edom in the Vail of Salt pittes ten thousand, and tooke the rocke in battel, and called the name therof, Iectehel vntil this present daye. <sup>8</sup>Then Amasias sent messengers to Ioas the sonne of Ioachaz, the sonne of Iehu the king of Israel, saying: Come, let vs see one an other. <sup>9</sup>And Ioas the king of Israel sent agayne to Amasias the king of Iuda saying: A thistle of Libanus sent to a cedar tree, which is in Libanus, saying: Geue thy daughter to my sonne to wife.
