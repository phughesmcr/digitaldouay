and how he hath raysed the magicians and sothsayers out of the land: why therefore doest thou lye in waite for my life, that I may be slaine? <sup>10</sup> And Saul sware vnto her in our Lord, saying: Our Lord liueth, there shal no euil happen vnto thee for this thing. <sup>11</sup> And the woman sayd to him: Whom shal I rayse vp to thee? Who sayd: Raise me vp Samuel. <sup>12</sup> And when the woman had seene Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and sayd to Saul: Why hast thou deceiued me? for thou art Saul. <sup>13</sup> And the King sayd to her: Feare not: what sawest thou? And the woman sayd to Saul: I saw Goddes coming out of the earth. <sup>14</sup> And he sayd to her: What maner of forme hath he? who sayd: An old man is come vp, and he is clothed with a mantel. And Saul vnderstood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himselfe vpon his face on the earth, and adored. <sup>15</sup> And Samuel sayd to Saul: why hast thou disquieted me, that I should be raised vp? And Saul sayd, I am in great distresse: for the Philistijms fight against me, and God is departed from me, and would not heare me, neither in the hand of prophetes, nor by dreames: therefore I haue called thee, that thou shouldest shew me, what I shal doe. <sup>16</sup> And Samuel sayd: Why askest thou, whereas our Lord is departed from thee, and is passed to thine aduersarie? <sup>17</sup> For our Lord wil doe to thee as he spake in my hand, and he wil cut thy kingdome out of thy hand, & wil geue it to thy neighbour Dauid: <sup>18</sup> because thou hast not obeyed the voice of our Lord, neither didst thou the wrath of his furie in Amalec. Therefore that which thou sufferest hath our Lord done to thee this day. <sup>19</sup> And our Lord wil geue Israel also with thee into the handes of the Philistijms: and to morow thou and thy sonnes shal be with me: yea the campe also of Israel wil our Lord deliuer into the handes of the Philistijms. <sup>20</sup> And forthwith Saul fel stretched forth on the ground, for he feared much the wordes of Samuel, and there was no strength in him, because he had not eaten bread al that day. <sup>21</sup> That woman therefore went vnto Saul (for he was very much trubled) and sayd to him: Behold thy handmaide hath obeied thy voice, and I haue put my life in my hand: and I heard the wordes, which thou spakest to me. <sup>22</sup> Now therefore heare thou also the voice of thy handmaide, and I wilset before thee a morsel of bread, that eating thou mayest recouer strength, and be able to goe on thy iourney. <sup>23</sup> Who refused, and sayd: I wil not eate.
