the tribes, and did the iustices of our Lord, and his iudgement with Israel.

<sup>22</sup> To Dan also he said: Dan a lions whelpe, he shal flow largely from Basan.

<sup>23</sup> And to Nephthali he said: Nephthali shal enioy abundance, and shal be ful of the blessinges of our Lord: the sea and the south he shal possesse.

<sup>24</sup> To Aser also he said: Blessed be Aser in children, be he acceptable to his brethren, and dippe he in oile his foote.

<sup>25</sup> His shoe yron and brasse. As the daies of thy youth, so also thy old age.

<sup>26</sup> There is no other God as the God of the rightest: the mounter of heauen is thy helper. By his magnificence the cloudes runne hither and thither,

<sup>27</sup> his habitation is aboue, and vnder the euerlasting armes: he shal cast out the enemie from thy face, and shal say: Be destroyed.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXXIII.

[^1] Came from Sinai.] According to the historie Moyses recounteth here three benefites. First that God gaue the Law in Sinai. (*Exod. 20.*) Secondly, he cured those which were bitten with serpentes nere to Seir. (*Num. 21.*) Thirdly in mount Pharan he appointed Seuentie ancientes to assist Moyses in iudgementes (*Num. 11.*) But according to the Mysterie, which specially is intended, S. Augustin (*q. 56. in Deut.*) saieth this prophecie is not to be negligently passed ouer. For it euidently appeareth that this benediction pertaineth to a new people, whom Christ our Lord hath sanctified, in whose person Moyses spake and not in his owne. So in this prophetical and proper sense (saieth this Doctor) our Lord and Sauiour cometh from *Sinai*, which is interpreted *tentation*, when he passed the tentation of his passion and death, *Heb. 2. v. 18.* Christ riseth from *seir*, interpreted *hearie*, for that in the similitude of the flesh of sinne, enen of sinne, he damned sinne in the flesh. *Rom. 8. v. 3.* He appeareth from mount *Pharan* interpreted *fruitful mountaine*, in that he geueth abundance of grace in his Church of the new Testament; which is a citie set vpon a hil. *Mat. 5.*

[^2] The prophetical sense of these blessings is more certaine, & more euident, then the historical.
