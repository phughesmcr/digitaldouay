by mouth thou hadst promised, in worke thou hast accompli-
shed, as also the present time proueth. <sup>16</sup> Now therfore Lord
God of Israel, fulfil to thy seruant my father Dauid, what
soeuer thou didst speake to him, saying: There shal not fayle
of thee a man before me, to sitte vpon the throne of Israel:
yet so if thy children keepe their waies, and walke in my law,
as thou also hast walked before me. <sup>17</sup> And now Lord God of
Israel, be thy word confirmed, which thou hast spoken to
thy seruant Dauid. <sup>18</sup> Is it credible then that God should
dwel with men vpon the earth? If heauen and the heauens
of heauens doe not take thee, how much more this house,
which I haue built? <sup>19</sup> But to this end only it is made, that
thou shouldest respect the prayer of thy seruant, and his sup-
plication Lord my God: and mayst heare the prayers, which
thy seruant powreth out before thee: <sup>20</sup> that thou open thine
eies vpon this house daies & nightes, vpon the place, wherein
thou hast promised that thy name should be inuocated, <sup>21</sup> and
wouldest heare the prayer, which thy seruant prayeth in it:
and mayst heare the prayers of thy seruant, and of thy people
Israel. Whosoeuer shal pray in this place, heare out of thy
habitation, that is from the heauens, and be propitious. <sup>22</sup> If
anie man shal sinne agaynst his neighbour, and come readie
to sweare agaynst him, and binde himself with a curse before
the altar in this house: <sup>23</sup> thou shalt heare from heauen, and
shalt doe the iudgement of thy seruantes, so that thou render
to the vniust his way vpon his owne head, and reuenge the
iust, rewarding him according to his iustice. <sup>24</sup> If thy people
Israel shal be ouercome of their enemies, (for they wil sinne
to thee) and conuerted shal doe penance, and beseech thy
name, and pray in this place, <sup>25</sup> thou shalt heare from heauen,
and be thou propitious to the sinne of thy people Israel, and
reduce them into the land, which thou gauest them, and their
fathers. <sup>26</sup> If the heauen being shut, there fal no rayne for the
sinnes of the people, and they shal beseech thee in this place,
and shal confesse to thy name, and shal be conuerted from
their sinnes, when thou shalt afflict them, <sup>27</sup> heare from
heauen O Lord, and forgeue the sinnes of thy seruantes and of
thy people Israel, and teach them the good way, by the which
they may goe: and geue rayne to thy land, which thou hast
geuen thy people to possesse. <sup>28</sup> If famine shal arise in the land,
and pestilence, rust, and blast, and locust, and bruche, and the

vp others to
godlie imita-

sed by deuout
persons both

new Testa-
ment.
