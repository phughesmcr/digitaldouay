# OF KINGES. CHAP. VII.

Eliseus prophecieth plentie of corne the next day, and death to a chiefman that wil not beleue it. 5. Foure Lepers going to yeld themselues to the Syrians, 6. Who by Gods prouidence are frighted and fled away, 9. bring newes therof to Samaria, 12. which by trial is found true, 16. And so there is plentie of corne, and the incredulous nobleman is trod to death, with presse of multitude in the gate, as the prophet foretold.

<sup>1</sup> AND Eliseus sayd: Heare ye the word of our Lord: Thus sayth our Lord: At this time to morow a bushel of floure shal be at one stater, and two bushels of barley at one stater, in the gate of Samaria. <sup>2</sup> One of the Dukes, vpon whose hand the king leaned, answearing the man of God, sayd: If our Lord shal make fludgates in heauen, can that possibly be which thou speakest? Who sayd: Thou shalt see it with thine eies, and shalt not eate therof. <sup>3</sup> There were therfore foure men lepers, beside the entrance of the gate: who sayd one to an other: What meane we to be here til we die? <sup>4</sup> Whether we enter into the citie, we shal die for famine: or whether we tarie here, die we must: come therfore, and let vs runne away to the campe of Syria. If they spare vs, we shal liue: but if they wil kil vs, we shal die neuerthelesse. <sup>5</sup> They arose therfore in the euening, to come to the campe of Syria. And when they were come to the beginning of the campe of Syria, <sup>6</sup> they found no man there. For our Lord had made them in the campe of Syria to heare the sound of chariotes, and horses; and of a verie great armie: and they sayd one to an other: Behold the king of Israel hath for wages hyred agaynst vs the kinges of the Hetheites, and of the Aegyptians, and they are come vpon vs. <sup>7</sup> They arose therfore, and fled in the darke, and leaft their tentes, and their horses and asses in the campe, and fled desirous to saue their liues only. <sup>8</sup> Therfore when those lepers were come to the beginning of the campe, they entered into one tabernacle, and did eate and drinke: and they tooke thence siluer, and gold, and rayment, and went, and hid it: againe they returned to an other tabernacle, and from thence likewise taking away they hid it. <sup>9</sup> And they said one to an other: We doe not wel: for this is a day of good tydinges. If we shal hold our peace, and wil not tel vntil morning, we shal be blamed of a heinous offence: Come, let vs goe, and make report in the kinges court.
