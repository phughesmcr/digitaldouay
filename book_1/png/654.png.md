<aside>Dauid by the priests mediation, was instructed what to do.</aside>

Abiathar applied the Ephod to Dauid, <sup>8</sup> and Dauid consulted our Lord, saying: Shal I pursue these theeues, and shal I take them or no? And our Lord sayd to him: Pursue them: for thou shalt take them without doubt, & take from them the praye. <sup>9</sup> Dauid therefore went himselfe, and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came vnto the Torrent Besor: & some, being wearie stayed. <sup>10</sup> But Dauid himselfe, and foure hundred men pursued: for two hundred stayed, who being wearie could not passe the Torrent Besor. <sup>11</sup> And they found an Ægyptian in the field, and brought him to Dauid: and they gaue him bread to eate, and water to drink, <sup>12</sup> and also a peece of a masse of drie figges, and two bunches of resinnes. Who when he had eaten, his spirite returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunken water three daies, and three nightes. <sup>13</sup> Dauid therefore sayd to him. Whose art thou? or whence? and whither goest thou? who sayd: I am a yong man of Ægypt, the seruant of an Amalecite: and my maister hath leift me, because I began to be sicke three daies agone. <sup>14</sup> For we brake forth at the south side of Cerethi, and against Iuda, and at the south of Caleb, and burnt Siceleg with fire. <sup>15</sup> And Dauid sayd to him: Canst thou bring me to this companie? Who sayd: Sweare to me by God, that thou wilt not kil me, nor deliuer me into the handes of my lord, and I wil bring thee to this companie. And Dauid sware to him. <sup>16</sup> Who when he had brought them, behold they sate vpon the face of al the earth, eating and drinking, and as it were keping festiual day, for al the praye, and spoiles which they had taken out of the Land of the Philistijms, and out of the Land of Iuda. <sup>17</sup> And Dauid stroke them from euening vntil the euening of the next day, and there escaped not anie of them, but foure hundred yong men, which had gotten vpon camels, and were fled. <sup>18</sup> Dauid therefore reskewed al thinges, that the Amalecites had taken, and he reskewed his two wiues. <sup>19</sup> Neither was there anie wanting from litle to great as wel of their sonnes as of their daughters, and of the spoiles, and what thinges soeuer they had taken, Dauid brought al againe. <sup>20</sup> And he tooke al the flockes & heardes, and draue them before his face: and they sayd: This is the praye of Dauid. <sup>21</sup> And Dauid came to the two hundred men, which being wearie had staied, neither were able to folow Dauid, and he had bidden them to rest in the Torrent Besor:
