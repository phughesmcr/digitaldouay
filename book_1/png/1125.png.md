The booke

<sup>17</sup> Shadowes doe protect his shadow, the willowes of the tor-
<sup>18</sup> rent shal compasse him. † Loe, he shal sup vp the riuer, and
shal not meruaile: and he hath confidence that Iordan may
<sup>19</sup> runne into his mouth. † In his eies as with a hooke he shal take
him, and with stakes he shal boare through his nosthreles.
<sup>20</sup> † Canst thou drawe out the :: Leuiathan with a hooke, and
<sup>21</sup> with a rope shalt thou tye his tongue? † Shalt thou put a ring
<sup>22</sup> in his nosthreles, or bore through his iaw with a buckle? † Wil
he multiplie prayers to thee, or speake to thee gentle wordes?
<sup>23</sup> † Wil he make a couenant with thee, and shalt thou take him
<sup>24</sup> to be a seruant for euer? † Shalt thou delude him as a birde,
<sup>25</sup> or tye him for thy handmaydes? † Shal freindes cut him, mer-
<sup>26</sup> chantes diuide him? † Shalt thou fil nettes with his skinne,
<sup>27</sup> and the cabbin of fishes with his heade. † Lay thy hand vpon
<sup>28</sup> him: remember battel, and adde to speake no more. † Behold
his hope shal frustrate him, and in the sight of al he shal be
cast downe headlong.

<sup>1</sup> Not as :: cruel wil I raise him: for who can resist my con-

wil not spare him, and his mightie wordes, and framed to be-

<sup>5</sup> shal enter into the middes of his mouth? † Who shal open the
gate of his countenance? dreade is round about his teeth.
<sup>6</sup> † His bodie as shildes that are cast, compact with skales fast
<sup>7</sup> cleauing together. † One is ioyned to an other, and not so

<sup>9</sup> † His sneesing is as the shining of fire, & his eies as the twink-

breath maketh coales to burne, & a flame cometh forth out

[^5]: God at last destroyeth him whom man can not ouercome.
