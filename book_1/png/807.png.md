kinges scribe, and the high priest went vp, and powred it out, and counted the money, that was found in the house of our Lord: <sup>11</sup> and they gaue it according to number and measure into their hand, which did ouersee the masons of the house of our Lord: who bestowed it on carpenters, and on masons, <sup>12</sup> such as wrought in the house of our Lord, and made reparations: and on them that hewed stones, and that they should bye trees, and stones, that were hewed, so that the reparation of the house of our Lord was accomplished in al thinges, <sup>13</sup> which had neede of cost to vphold the house. But yet there were not made of the same money the water pottes of the temple of our Lord, and the fleshhooks, and censars, and trumpets, and euerie vessel of gold and siluer, of the money, <sup>14</sup> that was brought into the temple of our Lord. <sup>15</sup> For it was geuen them that did the worke, that the temple of our Lord might be repayred: and there was no account made with those men, that receiued the money to distribute it to the craftes men, but vpon their fidelitie they bestowed it. <sup>16</sup> But the money for offence & the money for sinnes, they brought not into the temple of our Lord, because it was the priestes. <sup>17</sup> Then Hazael the king of Syria went vp, and fought agaynst Geth, and tooke it: and directed his face to goe vp to Ierusalem. <sup>18</sup> For which cause Ioas the king of Iuda tooke al the sanctified thinges, which Iosaphat, and Ioram, and Ochozias his fathers the kinges of Iuda had consecrated, and which him self had offered: and al the siluer, that could be found in the treasures of the temple of our Lord, and in the kinges palace: and sent it to Hazael the king of Syria, and he retyred from Ierusalem. <sup>19</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ioas, and al that he did, are not these thinges written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>20</sup> And his seruantes arose, and conspired among them selues, and stroke Ioas in the house of Mello in the descent of Sella. <sup>21</sup> For Iosachar the sonne of Semaath, and Iozabad the sonne of Somer his seruantes stroke him, and he died: and they buried him with his fathers in the citie of Dauid, and Amasias his sonne reigned for him.
