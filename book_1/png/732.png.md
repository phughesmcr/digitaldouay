Salomon.

<aside>Resurrection.</aside>

sountrie, til the death of the high priest (Num. 35.) & by Moyses dying in the desert, and not entring into the promised land ouer Iordan. Deut. 4. 31. & 34.

Presupposing the general Resurrection of al men (as a truth knowen by former traditions) king Dauid sheweth the difference of the wicked, and godlie in that time, saying (Psal. 1.) The impious shal not rise againe in iudgement: nor sinners in the councel of the iust: that is, the wicked shal not rise to ioy & glorie, as the iust & godlie shal doe.

<aside>Iudgement.</aside>

Of general iudgement is more plainly prophecied, is. Reg. 2. That our Lord shal iudge the endes of the earth, not that Dauid, nor Salomon, but Christ should raigne in his militant Church; euen to the endes of the earth, and in fine iudge the whole world: The same is confirmed Psal. 49. God wil come manifestly our God, and he wil not keepe silence. Fire shal burne forth in his sight. Psal. 95. He shal iudge the round world in equitie, and the peoples in his truth Psal. 96. Fire shal goe before him, and shal inflame his enemies round about. Againe the same royal prophete (Psalm. 48.) describeth the future and eternal state of the damned saying: as sheepe (creatures vnable to helpe themselues) they are put in hel, death shal feede vpon them. of the blessed he addeth: And the iust shal rule ouer them in the morning, that is, in the resurrection, and Psal. 149. The Sainctes shal reioyce in glorie, they shal be ioyful in their beddes (in eternal rest.) The exaltations (prayses) of God in their throate, and two edged swordes in their handes: to doe reuenge in the nations, punishmentes among the peoples. To bind their kinges in fetters; and their nobles in yron manicles. That they may doe in them the iudgement that is written: This glorie is to al his Sainctes. And much greater glorie belongeth to Sainctes: for this is but accidental, vttered according to vulgar capacitie. The essential and perfect glorie, which no eye hath seene, nor eare hath heard, nor hart can conceiue, consisteth in seing God. Among accidental glorious giftes, the foure dowries of glorified bodies are especially prefigured: Impassibilitie by the wood Setim, wherof the Arke was made (Exod. 25.) Agilitie and Penetrabilitie in some sorte by Dauids quicknes against Goliath, and his conueying of himself into Sauls campe and forth againe (1. Reg. 17. and 26.) but a more plaine figure of Claritie was in Moyses face (Exod. 34.) which by his conuersation with God, became more glorious then mortal eyes were able to behold, glistering and shining as most splendent light through christal, described as if his skinne had benne a clere horne; appearing and spreading beames like the sunne, proceding from the beautie of his soule, so that none of al the people could looke directly vpon him, except he couered his face.
