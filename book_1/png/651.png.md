pithonical spirite
: his seruantes and the woman forced him, and at length hea-
ring their voice, he arose from the ground, and sate vpon the
bed. <sup>24</sup> And that woman had a pasture fed calfe in the house,
and she made hast, and killed him: and taking meale kneded
it, and baked azimes, <sup>25</sup> and sette before Saul, and before his
seruantes, who when they had eaten rose vp, and walked
al that night.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXVIII.

<sup>24</sup> *Saul vnderstood that it was Samuel.* It is not defined nor certaine, whe-
ther the soule of Samuel appeared, or an euil spirit tooke his shape, and spake
to Saul. S. Augustin (*li. 2. q. 1. ad simplician*) proposeth both the opinions as
probable. Where first he sheweth, that Samuels soule might appeare; either
brought thither by the euil spirite, which is not so much to be merueled at, as
that our Lord and Sauiour suffred him self to be sette vpon the pinnacle of the
temple, and to be caried into a high mountaine by the diuel; yea to be taken
prisoner, bound, whipped, and crucified, by the diuels ministers: or that the
spirite of the holie prophet, was not raised by force of the inchantment, or
anie powre of the diuel, but by Gods secrete ordinance vnknowen to the py-
thonical woman, and to Saul, and so appeared in the kings presence, and stroke
him with diuine sentence. Againe he answereth, that there may be a more easie
and readie sense of this place, to wit, that Samuels spirite (or soule) was not in
deede raised, but an imaginarie illusion made by the diuels inchantment,
which semed to be Samuel, and which the Scripture calleth by the name of Sa-
muel, as pictures or images are commonly called those persons or thinges,
which they represent. So when we behold pictures in a table, or on a wal, we
say, this is Cicero, that is Salust, that Achilles, that is Rome. To this effect S.
Augustin discourseth more at large in the place before cited. But in an other
worke written after (*de cura pro mortuis gerenda. c. 15.*) teaching that soules of
the dead appeare sometimes to the liuing, he saith expressly, *Samuel the prophet
being dead, foretold thinges to King Saul yet liuing*. Though some be of opi-
nion (saith he) that Samuel himself appeared not, but some euil spirit tooke
his similitude.

And this last iudgement of S. Augustin is much confirmed: first by the wor-
des of this text, literally and plainly affirming that Samuel appeared, and spake
to Saul, and Saul to him, and that Saul *vnderstood* (or *knew*, not only thought,
imagined, or supposed) *that it was Samuel*. Secondly, this apparition came
sooner, preuenting the inchantment, and in better order, then the pithonical
woman expected, as appeareth by her answer, saying she saw God (or an ex-
cellent person) ascending in comlie maner and attyre: whereas euil spirites
vsed to appeare (as the Rabbins testifie) in vglie bodies, with the heeles into
the ayer, and head downward. Thirdly, the Author of Ecclesiasticus (*ch. 46.*)
amongst the prayses of Samuel the prophet, saith, *he slept*, (or died) *and cer-
tified the King, and shewed to him, the end of his life*. Where it semeth clere, that
the same person that died, denounced Gods wil and sentence to Saul. Moreouer
