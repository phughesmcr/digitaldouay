OF IOB.

See, northe taste of his children, nor torments of his bodie, could driue him to impatience but he stood immoueable in the seruice of God, for example to vs, that we fall not for anie worldlie damage, losse of dearest friendes or corporall afflictions. & blessed be God, by whose blessing we may now v.6 happie English Catholiques, that patientlie suffere the verie same kindes of tribulations, (though not in so great a degree ) in our time. S. Cyprian (*de bono patientiae*) Iob examined & proued by the vertue of patience was aduanced to the verie height of prayse, a rich lord in possession, & a more rich father in children, suddainly was neither lord, nor father: was also most greuously afflicted in his flesh: and that no tentation might be wanting the diuel armed his wife against him. yet was he not moued, but by victorious patience thanked God for al. In like sorte other holie fathers, for encouragement and consolation of the afflicted, write much of holie Iobs inuincible patience. Aboue al S. Gregorie, our Apostle, dilateth most excellently in thirtie and fiue whole bookes, describing & proposing his so great vertues to be imitated by al Christians, first of al (li. 1. c. 3.) obseruing how great a prayse it is to be good in such a place, *in the middes of a crooked and peruerse nation, shining as a light in the world, dwelling in the gentiles, where was the seate of Satan, a hillie man fl. bookes*.

*Satan by Gods permission, 7. striketh Iob with sores from the sole of his foote to the toppe of his head. 9. His wife also insulteth against him, but he sinneth not 11 Three friendes coming to visite and conforte him, sitte silent by him seuen dayes.*

<sup>1</sup> AND it came to passe when on a certaine day the sonnes of God were come, and stood before our Lord, and Satan came among them, and stood in his sight, <sup>2</sup> that our Lord sayd to Satan: From whence comest thou? who answering sayd: I haue gone round about the earth, and walked through it. <sup>3</sup> And our Lord sayd to Satan: Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there is not the like him in the earth, a man simple, and right, and fearing God, and departing from euil, and yet reteyning innocencie? But thou hast moued me against him, that I should afflict him in vaine. <sup>4</sup> To whom Satan answering, said: Skinne for skinne, & al thinges that a man hath, he wil geue for his life: <sup>5</sup> otherwise put thy hand, and touch his bone and flesh, and then shalt thou see that he wil blesse thee in the face. <sup>6</sup> Our Lord therfore sayd to Satan: Behold he is in thy hand, but yet saue his life. <sup>7</sup> Satan therefore
