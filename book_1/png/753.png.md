Roboam, OF KINGES. 735

yoke vpon vs: thou therfore diminish now a litle of thy fathers most hard empire, and of the most heauie yoke, that he layd vpon vs, and we wil serue thee. <sup>5</sup>Who sayd to them: Goe vntil the third day, and returne to me. And when the people was gone, <sup>6</sup>king Roboam tooke counsel with the ancientes, that assisted before Salomon his father, whiles he yet liued, and he sayd: What counsel doe you geue me, that I may answer this people? <sup>7</sup>Who sayd to him: If this day thou wilt yeld to this people, and condescend to them, and graunt to their petition, and wilt speake to them gentle wordes, they wil be thy seruantes alwaies. <sup>8</sup>Who leaft the counsel of the ancientes, which they had geuen him, and admitted yongmen, that had bene brought vp with him, and wayted on him, <sup>9</sup>and he sayd to them: What counsel geue you me, that I may answer this people, which haue sayd to me: Make the yoke lighter which thy father hath put vpon vs? <sup>10</sup>And the yongmen, that had bene brought vp with him, sayd: Thus speake to this people, which haue spoken to thee, saying: Thy father aggrauated our yoke, doe thou ease it. Thus shalt thou speake to them: My least finger is grosser than the backe of my father. <sup>11</sup>And now my father layd vpon you a heauie yoke, but I wil adde vpon your yoke: my father bette you with scourges, but I wil beate you with scorpions. <sup>12</sup>Ieroboam therefore came, and al the people to Roboam the third day, as the king had spoken, saying: Returne to me the third day. <sup>13</sup>And the king answered the people rough wordes, leauing the counsel of the ancientes, which they had geuen him, <sup>14</sup>and he spake to them according to the counsel of the youngmen, saying: My father made your yoke heauie, but I wil adde to your yoke: my father bette you with whippes, but I wil beate you with scorpions. <sup>15</sup>And the king condescended not to the people: because our Lord was turned away from him, that he might rayse vp his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the Silonite, to Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat. <sup>16</sup>The people therefore seing that the king would not heare them, answered him, saying: What part haue we in Dauid? or what inheritance in the sonne of Isai? Goe into thy tabernacles Israel, now see to thy house Dauid. And Israel went into their tabernacles. <sup>17</sup>But ouer the children of Israel, whosoeuer dwelt in the cities of Iuda, Roboam reigned. <sup>18</sup>King Roboam
