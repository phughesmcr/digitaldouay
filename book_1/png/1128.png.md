The booke

or that patient sustaining of worldlie losses, and other afflictions, such as Iob suffered, are not satisfactorie, or meritorious workes.

8. *These seuen oxen, and seuen rammes*. In the number of seuen is a mysterie of perfection and fulnes, often vsed in holie scripture. For God creating the world and al thinges therin, in six dayes, rested the seuenth. Seuenfold punish-ment was executed for Cain. Seuen priests with seuen trumpets were consecrated in Nazareth. And in the law the ground rested from tillage the seuenth yeare, with innumerable the like. As S. Gregorie in this place, and other Fathers note in their workes. Also these seuen victimes offered in sacrifice, import the great-nes of these mens offence in accusing Iob, and in auouching their false opinion.

8. *Iob shal pray for you*. Neither had so manie sacrifices sufficed, as S. Chri-sostom obserueth, *hom. 5. in Iudeos*, vnles Iob also had prayed for the offenders. Where we see that both Sacrifice, & the deuotion of him that offereth it, haue their effectes: whence commeth the distinction vsed in Scholes, of *opus opera-tum*, and *opus operantis*. As it is manifest likewise, that mediation of one man for an other, did not derogate from Gods benigne mercie, in the law of nature, wherein these men liued. Not now from Christes mediation, in the law of Grace. 2. Cor. 1. v. 11.

A BRIEF RECAPITVLATION
of this strange and sacred historie.

For auoiding prolixitie (this volume growing great) we haue for most part contracted our Annotations into the margin, making very few others in this booke, which otherwise offered much more occasion, as wel for explicating hard places, as of other doctrinal and moral instructions. Neither in dede can ordinarie Annotations wel suffice for vnderstanding of this, and other hard bookes. But rather large Commentaries are required, such as S. Gre-gorie, and other ancient Fathers; as also F. Iohn de Pineda, and others haue lately written. Wherto we therfore remitte the lerned readers. And for the benefite of others of our nation, we shal here briefly recapitulate the summe, and principal pointes of this holie and admirable historie, consisting in a sin-gular holie mans constancie, and glorious victorie, against inuisible and visi-ble aduersaries, both in prosperous and aduerse fortune.

First this holie man Iob in abundance of wealth and riches, blessed with manie children (ch. 1.) sitting in a princelie throne, and royal digni-tie (ch. 29.) in the land of Hus, was not only assaulted with common ten-tations of the continual enimie, as al are that liue piously in God, but so much the more, as he was more godlie, sincerer and perfecter then other men, yet he neuer set his hart vpon worldlie or temporal thinges, but with al due feare so serued God, and parted from euil, that Satan himself (the calumniator of mankind) could not charge him with anie sinne at al. Though he would not for al that confesse him to be iust, or perfect: but for further trial of him, demanded and obtained licence of God to touch al his possessions, and so bereaued him of al his goodes, & children in one day. And when he
