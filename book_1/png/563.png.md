Iephte.

Iephte offended in vowing without special warrant from God, to sacrifice, that indiscreetly: which by the law was not sacrificable,) yet sinned not in performing his vow, but rather pacified God thereby, whose will seemed to be, that for punishment of his sinne he should sacrifice his daughter, because by his divine providence the first mette him: and the omission might rather have benne for his natural love towards his onlie childe, then for the vnlawfulnes of the sacrifice: seeing it once pleased God to command Abraham to immolate his sonne Isaac, though when it came to execution, he forbade the same, appointing an other hostie in place of the childe, which here he did not. Neither was it iniurious to the daughter, seing she, as al mankinde, must once die when God appointeth. Yea further she offered herself freely (which semed to be by Gods instinct) willing her father to do to her whatsoever he had promised to God. This is the summe of S. Augustine large discourse. Likewise S. Ambrose (li. 3. *de offic. c. 12.) supposeth assuredly that this prince Iephte offended in vowing vnaduisedly, for it also repented him, when his daughter first mette him: yet that with godlie feare and dread he performed to his owne bitter paine that which he had promised; instituting an anniuersarie lamentation of his daughter, for a warning to posteritie of more circumspection in making vowes. S. Hierom also (li. 1. advers. Iovinian.) approveth their opinion that say: It was Gods ordinance Iephte should feele the errour of his vnaduised vow, by the death of his daughter, for a document to others. The very same teacheth S. Chrisostom, (ho. 14. ad pop. Antioch.) that God would have this errour to be thus punished, that others might be warned from vowing the like. S. Gregorie Nazianzeu (orat. de Machab.) preferring the martyrdome of the seven brothers and their mother, before this sacrifice of Iephte as more admired, and more honorable, yet condemneth not this, but recounteth it amongst other commendable actes. Theoderet (q. 19. in Iudic.) and al the aforesaid fathers do highly commend the daughters promptnes in offering her self to be sacrificed, which either much extenuated her fathers fault, or wholly iustified his fact. Thus the ancient fathers moderate their censures. Yet a new glosser of the English Bible without scruple sayeth, that by his rash vow, and wicked performance his action was defiled; and againe, that he was overcome with blinde zele, not considering whether the vow was lawful or no.

<sup>1</sup> BVT behold in Ephraim there arose a sedition. For they passing against the North, said to Iephte: Going to fight against the children of Ammon, why wouldst thou not cal vs, that we might goe with thee? Therfore we wil burne thy house. <sup>2</sup> To whom he answered: I and my people were at great strife against the children of Ammon: and I called you, that you should ayde me, and you would not doe it. <sup>3</sup> Which I seeing I put my life in myne owne handes, and passed to the children of Ammon, and our Lord delivered them into my handes.
