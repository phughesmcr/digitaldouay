OF KINGES,

<sup>11</sup> The names of the twelue sonnes of Israel were grauen in the two chiefe ornaments of the high priest, in the Ephod and Rationale (Exod. 18.) Manna was not only reserued as a memorie of Gods singular benefite, but also honorably reposed as a Relique in a golden vessel, and kept in the Arke of God (Exod. 16. Heb. 9.) Iosephs bones reserued and remoued (Iosue 24.) Images of holie Cherubims were made and sette vp together with the Arke, and Propitiatorie in the chiefe place of the Tabernacle, called Sancta Sanctorum (Exod. 25.) An image also of a serpent was made in brasse for the health of those that were striken by serpentes (Num. 21.) Images also of lions and oxen were made, and sette vnder the foote of the lauar (called a sea) in the Temple (3. Reg. 7.) The honour done to anie holie thing, namely to the Arke (2. Reg. 6.) redounded to Gods more honour, and al this so farre from idolatrie, that quite contrarie, in presence of the Arke the idol Dagon fel to the ground, and broke in peeces, 1. Reg. 5.

Exequies for the dead with weeping and fasting were then practised in the Church, as appeareth by the peoples mourning for Aaron thirtie dayes. Num. 20. Also for Moyses. (Deut. 34.) By the Gabaonites fasting seuen dayes for Saul and his sonnes lately slaine. 1. Reg. 31. Likewise king Dauid with al his court mourning weping and fasting for them. 2 Reg. 1. Al which were to no purpose, if soules departed could not be releeued by such meanes. It moreouer appeareth that the same royal prophet beleeued diuers places to be in hel, when he said (Psal. 85.) Thou hast deliuered my soule from the lower hel, signifying plainly that there is a lower and a higher hel: which higher the Church calleth Purgatorie, where soules suffer that paine in satisfaction for their sinnes, which remaineth not satisfied before death, or is due after the guilt of sinne is remitted, the law prescribing that besides restitution of damage, sacrifices should also be offered (Leuit. 5. 6. 16.) And Dauid was punished by the death of his child. 2. Reg. 12. Or by the plague sent amongst his people 2. Reg. 24. after his sinnes were remitted. He feared also punishment in the other world, yet was deliuered from both, saying: (Psal. 6.) Lord rebuke me not in thy furie, nor chastice me in thy wrath. that is (saith S. Gregorie) Strike me not with the reprobate, nor afflict me with those, that are purged by the punishing flames. And most expressly signifieth also a higher place called hel, saying (Psal. 15.) in the person of Christ to his Father: Thou shalt not leaue my soule in hel. From whence Christ deliuered the holie Patriarches Prophetes and other perfect soules, resting without sensible paine, or brought them into heauen, whither before him, none could enter which was also signified by the cities of refuge, whence none might depart to their proper countries.
