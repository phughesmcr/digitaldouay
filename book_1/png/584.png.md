come, and their brethren, and shal beginne to complaine against you, and to chide, we wil say to them: Haue pittie on them: for they tooke them not away by the right of warryers and conquerours, but when they desired to receiue them, you gaue them not, and on your part the fault was commit-ted. <sup>23</sup> And the children of Beniamin did, as it had beene commanded them: and according to their number, they tooke away to them selues of those that ledde the daunses, euerie one his wife: and they went into their possession, buil-ding cities, and dwelling in them. <sup>24</sup> The children of Israel also returned by their tribes, and families into their taberna-cles. In those daies there was not a King in Israel: but euerie one did that which semed right to him selfe.

THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF RVTH.

AMONGST other thinges that happened to the people of Israel, in the time of the iudges, this historie of Ruth, to wit, her coming from Moab, her conuersion to true Religion, godlie conuersation, and mariage with Booz of the tribe of Iuda, is recorded, as a more principal matter. For that not onlie king Dauid, but consequently also our SAVIOVR, the Redeemer of mankind descended from her. Whereby was foresignified, that as saluation thus proceded from the Gentiles together with the Iewes: so the Gentiles are made partakers of the same grace. More clerly prophecied, as S. Hierom noteth, by Isai (cap. 16.) saying: Send forth Ã´ Lord the lambe, the Ruler of the earth, from the Rocke of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Sion. That is, from Ruth the gentile to Hierusalem, or rather to the Church. This mariage of Ruth came to passe about the time of Abesan Iudge. The booke was written, as is most probable, by Samuel: and is diuided into foure chapters; whose contentes folow in their places.
