Eliseus, *of kinges.*

<sup>22</sup> he said: Wel, my maister hath sent me to thee, saying: Euen now there are come to me two yong men from mount Ephraim, of the children of the prophetes: geue them a talent of siluer, and two change of rayment. <sup>23</sup> And Naaman sayd: It is better that thou take two talentes. And he forced him, & bound the two talentes of siluer in two bagges, and the duble rayment, & layd it vpon two of his seruantes, who also caried it before him. <sup>24</sup> And when he was come now in the euening, he tooke it out of their hand, & layd it vp in the house, & dismissed the men, and they departed. <sup>25</sup> And himself going in, stood before his maister. And Eliseus said: From whence comest thou Giezi? Who answered: Thy seruant hath not gone any whither. <sup>26</sup> But he sayd: Was not my hart present, when the man returned out of his chariote to meete thee? Now therefore thou hast receiued siluer, and taken rayment, to bye oliuetes, and vineyardes, and sheepe, and oxen, and seruantes, and handmaides. <sup>27</sup> But the leprosie also of Naaman shal cleaue to thee, and to thy seede, for euer. And he went out from him a leper as it were snow.

CHAP. V.

<aside>*But in peace.*] Sheismatiques, as they are commonly (but improperly) now called in England, which being in mind and iudgement Catholiques, goe sometimes to Protestantes common prayers, or sermons, draw an excuse of their fact, from this warrant of the Prophet, permitting Nobleman of Syria to goe and serue his king in the temple, where he adored an Idol. But who-soeuer wil duly consider this example, shal find great difference in respect of the times, places, persons, and of the very doubtes proposed, between this mans case and ours. For before Christes Gospel was promulgate, neither al Articles of faith were so expressly taught, nor the external profession therof so strictly commanded, as now they are in time of more grace, which geueth more ayde to mans weaknes, wherin also more perfection is required, and therfore our Sauiour exacteth of al to confesse him, and his Religion, before men: *else he wil denie them before his Father.* Likewise in the place, where this Nobleman dwelt, his presence in the temple, and seruice to the king, could not be accounted a reuolt from true religion, which was neuer professed there, nor be scandalous to anie man being al Infidels: but in a christian countrie, where al beare the name of Christians, especially where men are at controuersie about the true Christian religion, al that frequent, or repaire to the same assemblies, for publique seruice of God, are reputed to be of the same religion: or els dissemblers, as it were to haue no care of religion, knowing God, and not glorifying him as God. And reuolting from the truth which they had lerned. The difference also of persons is great. For this Nobleman hauing before his conuersion serued his king, in the office of sustayning him, when he bowed to the Idol, if he should haue refused to do the same, it would rather haue bene supposed, that he disdained</aside>
