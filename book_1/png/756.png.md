<sup>11</sup> And a certaine prophete being old dwelt in Bethel, to whom his sonnes came and told him al the workes, that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: and the wordes which he had spoken to the king, they told their father.

<sup>12</sup> And their father sayd to them: What way went he? His sonnes shewed him the way, by which the man of God was gone, which came out of Iuda.

<sup>13</sup> And he said to his sonnes: Sadle me an asse. Who when they had sadled it, he got vp,

<sup>14</sup> and went after the man of God, and found him sitting vnder a terebinth: and he said to him: Art thou the man of God that camest out of Iuda? He answered: I am he.

<sup>15</sup> And he sayd to him: Come home with me, that thou mayst eate bread.

<sup>16</sup> Who sayd: I can not returne, nor come with thee, neither wil I eate bread, nor drinke water in this place:

<sup>17</sup> because our Lord spake to me in the word of our Lord, saying: Thou shalt not eate bread, and thou shalt not drinke water there, nor returne by the way thou wentest.

<sup>22</sup> and hast returned, and eaten bread, & drunke water in the place wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldest not eate bread, nor drinke water, thy dead bodie shal not be brought into the sepulchre of thy fathers.

<sup>23</sup> And when he had eaten & drunke, he sadled his asse for the prophet, whom he brought backe.

<sup>24</sup> Who when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and [^2] killed him, and his bodie was cast forth in the way: and the asse stood by him, and the lion stood by the dead bodie.

<sup>25</sup> And behold, men passing by saw the dead bodie cast in the way, and the lion standing beside the bodie. And they came and diuulged it in the citie, wherein that old prophet dwelt.

<sup>26</sup> Which when that prophet heard, which had brought him backe out of the way, he sayd: It is the man
