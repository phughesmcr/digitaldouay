the brimme of a chalice, and the leafe of crispedlilie: it con-
tayned two thousand <sup>27</sup> bates. And he made ten brasen seete,
of foure cubites in length euerie foote, and foure cubites in
bredth, and three cubites in height. <sup>28</sup> And the verie worke
it selfe of the seete, was entergrauen: and entergrauinges
betwen the ioyntures. <sup>29</sup> And betwen the litle crownes and
the playtes, lions, and oxen, and cherubs: and in the ioyntures
likewise aboue: and vnder the lions, and oxen as it were ban-
des of brasse hanging downe. <sup>30</sup> And foure wheeles at euerie
foote, and axeltrees of brasse: and at foure sides as it were
litle shoulders vnder the lauatorie cast, looking one against an-
other. <sup>31</sup> The mouth also of the lauatorie was inward in
the toppe of the head: and that which appeared outward,
was of one cubite al round, and together it had one cubite
& a halfe: and in the corners of the pillers were diuers engra-
uinges: and the middle enterpillers square not round. <sup>32</sup> The
foure wheeles also, which were at the foure corners of a foote,
ioyned one to another vnder the foote: one wheele had in
height a cubite and a halfe. <sup>33</sup> And they were such wheeles as
are accustomed to be made in a chariote: and their axeltrees
and spokes, and strakes, and naues, al cast. <sup>34</sup> For those foure
litle shoulders also at euerie corner of one foote, were cast out
of the foote and ioyned together. <sup>35</sup> And in the toppe of
the foote was a certayne roundnes of halfe a cubite, so
wrought, that the lauatorie might be put thereon, hauing the
engrauinges therof, and diuerse caruinges of it self. <sup>36</sup> He
graued also in those fielinges, which were of brasse, and in
the corners, cherubs, and lions, and palmetrees, as it were in
the similitude of a man standing, that they semed not to be
engrauen, but put to round about. <sup>37</sup> After this maner made
he ten feete, of one casting and measure, & like grauing. <sup>38</sup> He
made also ten lauatories of brasse: one lauatorie conteyned
fourtie bates, and it was of foure cubites: also at euerie foote,
that is ten, he put so manie lauatories. <sup>39</sup> And he sette the ten
feete, fiue on the right side of the temple, and fiue on the
leaft: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple against
the East toward the South. <sup>40</sup> Hiram therfore made cauldrons,
and shoueles, and litle pottes, and perfected al the worke of
king Salomon in the temple of our Lord. <sup>41</sup> Two pyllers, and
two cordes of the litle heades, vpon the litle heades of the pyl-
lers: and two litlenettes, to couer the two cordes, that were
