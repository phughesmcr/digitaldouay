Masphaalsoof Galaad, and thence passing to the children of Ammon, <sup>30</sup> he vowed a vow to our Lord, saying: If thou wilt deliuer the children of Ammon into my handes, <sup>31</sup> whosoever shal first come forth out of the doores of my house, and shal meete me returning with peace from the children of Ammon, him wil I offer an holocauste to our Lord. <sup>32</sup> And Iephte passed to the children of Ammon, to fight against them: whom our Lord deliuered into his handes. <sup>33</sup> and he stroke from Aroer til thou come to Mennith, twentie cities, and as farre as Abel, which is sette with vineyardes, with a very great plague. and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel <sup>34</sup> But Iephte returning into Maspha to his house, his onlie begotten daughter mette him with tymbrels and daunces. for he had not other children. <sup>35</sup> Whom when he saw, he rent his garmentes, and said: Wo is me my daughter thou hast deceiued me, and thy self art deceiued: for I haue opened my mouth to our Lord, and I can doe no other thing. <sup>36</sup> To whom she answered: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to our Lord, do vnto me whatsoeuer thou hast promised, the reuenge and victorie of thyne enemies being granted to thee. <sup>37</sup> And she said to her father: This only grant me which I desire: Suffer me that two monethes I may goe about the mountaines, and bewayle my virginitie with my felowes. <sup>38</sup> To whom he answered: Goe. And he dismissed her two monethes. And when she was gone with her felowes and companions, she mourned her virginitie in the mountaines. <sup>39</sup> And the two monethes being expired, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed, who knew not man. Thence forth a fashion in Israel, and a custome was kept: <sup>40</sup> that after the compasse of a yeare the daughters of Israel assemble together, and mourne the daughter of Iephte the Galaadite foure dayes.

39. *Did to her as he had vowed.*] VVhether Iephte did wel or no in sacrificing his daughter, hauing vowed to offer in sacrifice whosoeuer (or whatsoeuer) should first mete him returning with victorie, as it hapened she did, is a great and hard question, saith S. Augustin (q. 49. in lib. Iudic.) and not easily decided, the holie scripture neither approuing nor reprouing his fact. Neuerthelesse by conference of other scriptures and discourse of reason, he iudgeth it most probable that Iephte
