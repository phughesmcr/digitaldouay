# Third booke

Vpon example of the new Testament so expounding the old. Namely S. Paul teaching (as before is noted) that the whole law was a pedagogue guiding men to Christ, and affirming that al thinges happened to the people of the old Testament in figure of the new.

Leauing therfore to prosecute the same further, which would require a verie great worke, it may here suffice to geue according to the literal sense, a briefe view of certaine other pointes of Religion, practised in this fourth age.

Where it is clere, that as Iacob the Patriarch had foretold (Gen. 48.) that Abrahams, Isaacs, and his owne name should be inuocated, so Moyses prayd God for his promise made to them, and for their sake, to pardon the people, saying: Exod. 32. Remember Ã´ Lord Abraham, Isaac, & Israel. And our Lord was pacified, from doing the euil which he had spoken against his people. His diuine prouidence so disposing, that he could be hindered, by such prayers, from that which he threatned. And wheras Moyses did not directly inuocate the holie Patriarches, as Christians now cal vpon glorified Sainctes, to pray for them, the cause of difference is, for that now Sainctes seing God, know in him, whatsoeuer perteyneth to their glorie, which state none before Christ attained vnto. Num 35. v. 25. Deut. 4. v. 22.

Againe Protestantes obiect, that for so much as God knoweth al our necessities, desires, dispositions, and whatsoeuer is in man, it is nedles (say they) superfluous & in vaine, that Sainctes should commend our causes. To this we answer, that not only glorious Sainctes, but also mortal men by Gods ordinance (by which nothing is done vainly) do such offices, as mediators betwen God and other men, for so Moyses told the wordes of the people to our Lord (Exod. 19.) notwithstanding Gods omniscience, or knowledge of al thinges. Also God expressly commanded Iobs freinds to goe to Iob, promising to heare his prayer for them. As for Sainctes hearing or knowing our prayers made to them, though onlie God of himselfe, and by his owne power, seeth mens secrete cogitations, and therfore is properly called the searcher of hartes (1. Reg. 16.) yet God communicateth this power to prophetes, to see the secrete thoughtes of others; so Samuel knew the cogitations of Saul (1. Reg. 9. v. 20.) And Abias saw by reuelation the coming of Ieroboams wife to him in Silo (3. Reg. 14.) Much more God reueleth our present state, and affaires to glorified soules; who are as Angels in heauen (Math. 22.) and being secure of their owne glorie, are careful (sayeth S. Cyprian) of our Saluation. Neither is it derogation to God that Sainctes are honoured, and titles ascribed to them, of intercessors, mediators, and the like; for such titles are geuen to them not as to God, but by way of participation only. So Iudges are called goddes and sauiours (Exod. 22. Iudic. 3.) and Priestes called goddes (Exod. 22.) Praise geuen to God and Gedeon. Iudic. 7. Protection and adoration of Angels is very frequent, Exod. 23. 32.
