Amasias the king of Iuda, are not these thinges writen in the
Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Israel? And
<sup>16</sup> Ioas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the
kinges of Israel: & Ieroboam his sonne reigned for him. <sup>17</sup> And
Amasias the sonne of Ioas the king of Iuda liued, after that
Ioas the sonne of Ioachaz the king of Israel was dead, fiftene
yeares. <sup>18</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Amasias, are not
these thinges writen in the Booke of the wordes of the daies
of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>19</sup> And there was a conspiracie made
against him in Ierusalem: but he fled into Lachis. And they
sent after him into Lachis, and killed him there. <sup>20</sup> And they
caried him away vpon horses, and he was buried in Ierusalem
with his fathers in the Citie of Dauid. <sup>21</sup> And al the people of
Iuda tooke Azarias sixtene yeares old, and made him king for
his father Amasias. <sup>22</sup> He built Ã†lath, and restored it to Iuda,
after that the king slept with his fathers. <sup>23</sup> In the fiftenth
yeare of Amasias the sonne of Ioas the king of Iuda, reigned
Ieroboam the sonne of Ioas the king of Israel in Samaria, one
and fourtie yeares: <sup>24</sup> and he did that which is euil before
our Lord. He departed not from al the sinnes of Ieroboam
the sonne of Nabat, who made Israel to sinne. <sup>25</sup> He restored
the borders of Israel from the entrance of Emath, vnto the Sea
of the wildernesse, according to the word of our Lord the
God of Israel, which he spake by his seruant Ionas the sonne of
Amathi, the prophete, who was of Geth, which is in Opher.
<sup>26</sup> For our Lord saw the affliction of Israel exceeding bitter,
and that they were consumed vnto the imprisoned & meanest
persons, and that there was none to helpe Israel: <sup>27</sup> Neither
did our Lord determine that he would destroy the name of
Israel from vnder heauen, but he saued them in the hand of
Ieroboam the sonne of Ioas. <sup>28</sup> But the rest of the wordes of
Ieroboam, and al that he did, and his strength, wherwith he
fought, and how he restored Damascus, and Emath to Iuda in
Israel, are not these thinges writen in the Booke of the wor-
des of the daies of the kinges of Israel? <sup>29</sup> And Ieroboam slept
with his fathers the kinges of Israel, and Zacharias his sonne,
reigned for him.
