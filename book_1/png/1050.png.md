IVDITH.

Lord hath not suffered me his handmayde to be defyled, but without pollution of sinne he hath called me backe to you, reioycing in this victorie, in my escape, and in your deliuerie. <sup>21</sup> Confesse ye al to him, because he is good, because his mercie is for euer. <sup>22</sup> And they al adoring our Lord, said to her: Our Lord hath blessed thee in his power, because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nothing. <sup>23</sup> Moreouer Ozias the prince of the people of Israel, said to her: Blessed art thou daughter of our Lord the high God aboue al wemen vpon the earth. <sup>24</sup> Blessed be our Lord, which made heauen and earth, which hath directed thee vnto the woundes of the head of the prince of our enemies. <sup>25</sup> Because this day he hath so magnified thy name, that thy prayse shal not depart out of the mouth of men, which shal be mindeful of the power of our Lord for euer, for that thou hast not spared thy life for the distresses and tribulation of thy kinred, but hast holpen the ruine before the presence of our God. <sup>26</sup> And al the people sayd: So be it, so be it. <sup>27</sup> Moreouer Achior being called came, and Iudith said to him: The God of Israel, to whom thou gauest testimonie, that he reuengeth him self of his enemies, he hath cut of the head of al the vnfaithful this night by my hand. <sup>28</sup> And that thou mayst proue that it is so, loe the head of Holofernes, who in the contempt of his pride contemned the God of Israel: and threatened thee death, saying: When the people of Israel shal be taken, I wil command thy sides to be pearced with a sword. <sup>29</sup> But Achior seing the head of Holofernes, being in anguish for feare, fel on his face vpon the earth, and his soule was sore trubled. <sup>30</sup> But after taking spirit agayne he was refreshed, & fel downe at her feete, and adored her, and sayd: <sup>31</sup> Blessed art thou of thy God in euerie tabernacle of Iacob, because in euerie nation, which shal heare thy name, the God of Israel shal be magnified in thee.
