Of Israel Ochozias.

OF KINGES. 761

an Angel of our Lord spake to Elias the Thesbite, saying:
Arise, and goe vp to meete the messengers of the king of
Samaria, and thou shalt say to them: What is there not a God
in Israel, that ye goe to consult Beelzebub the god of Ac-
caron? <sup>4</sup> Wherfore thus saith our Lord: From the bed on
which thou art ascended, thou shalt not goe downe, but
dying thou shalt die. And Elias went away. <sup>5</sup> And the mes-
sengers returned to Ochozias: Who said to them: Why are
you returned? <sup>6</sup> But they answered him: A man mette vs:
and sayd to vs: Goe, and returne to the king, that sent you, and
you shal say to him: Thus saith our Lord: Doest thou therfore
send to consult Beelzebub the god of Accaron, because there
was no God in Israel? Therfore from the bed, which thou
art vpon, thou shalt not goe downe, but dying thou shalt
dye. <sup>7</sup> Who said to them: What shape and habite had that
man, which mette you, and spake these wordes? <sup>8</sup> But they
said: A hearie man, and girded about his raines with a girdle
of lether: Who said: It is Elias the Thesbite. <sup>9</sup> And he
sent vnto him a captaine of fiftie men, and the fiftie that were
vnder him. Who went vp, and sayd to him sitting in the toppe
of the mount: Man of God, the king hath commanded that
thou come downe. <sup>10</sup> And Elias answering, sayd to the cap-
taine of fiftie men: If I be a man of God, let fyre come
downe from heauen, and deuoure thee, and thy fiftie. Fyre
therfore came downe from heauen, and deuoured him and
the fiftie men that were with him. <sup>11</sup> And he sent againe
vnto him an other captaine of fiftie men, and his fiftie with
him. Who spake to him: Man of God, Thus saith the king:
Make hast, come downe. <sup>12</sup> Elias answering said: If I be a
man of God, let fyre come downe from heauen, and deuoure
thee, and thy fiftie. Fyre therfore came downe from heauen,
and deuoured him, and his fiftie. <sup>13</sup> Agayne he sent a third
captaine of fiftie men, and the fiftie that were with him.
Who when he was come, bowed his knees toward Elias,
and prayed him and sayd: Man of God despise not my life
and the liues of thy seruantes that are with me. <sup>14</sup> Behold
fyre came downe from heauen, and hath deuoured the two
first captaynes of fiftie men, and the fifties, that were with
them: but now I beseech thee that thou haue mercie on my life.
<sup>15</sup> And an Angel of our Lord spake to Elias, saying: Goe
downe with him, feare not. He therfore arose, and went
