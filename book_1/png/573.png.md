Michas idol:

IVDGES. 553

God directly and extraordinarily concurred by restoring in that moment his himselfe with admirable strength, that he could pull downe two such pillers. And confor- his enemies: mably we may gather, that God inspired his mind to attempt this fact, and so he erred not, but obeyed God herein: as S. Augustin noteth. *li. 1. c. 21. & 16. de ciuit. Dei*. Secondly he was moued with zele of Gods honour, hearing the Idolaters praise their false god Dagon. Thirdly, he had a good and pure intention to reuenge him selfe for Gods more glorie, praying to him for restauration of strength. Fourthly he did not directly desire to kil himselfe, but to kil the Phi- Samson a fi-listims, though himselfe must also die with them. And in this act especially he gure of Christ, was a figure of Christ, who chiefly by his death conquered his enemies.

CHAP. XVII.

Michas and his mother cause a grauen, and a molten idol to be made of siluer. 5. He maketh one of his sonnes priest for the idol, 10. and for the same purpose hyreth also a Leuite.

<sup>1</sup> THERE was at that time a certaine man of mount Ephraim named Michas, <sup>2</sup> who said to his mother: The thousand and hundred siluer peeces, which thou hadst separated to thy selfe, and concerning the which thou didst sweare in my hearing, behold I haue, and they are with me. To whom she said: Blessed be my sonne to the Lord. <sup>3</sup> He therfore rendred them to his mother, who had said to him: I haue consecrated and vowed this siluer to the Lord, that my sonne may receiue it of my hand, and make :: a grauen and :: a molten (god) and now I deliuer that to thee. <sup>4</sup> He rendered them therfore to his mother: who tooke two hundred siluer peeces and gaue them to the siluersmith, that he might make of them a grauen and a molten (god) which was in the house of Michas. <sup>5</sup> Who separated also therein a litle house to the God, and made an Ephod, and Theraphim, that is to say, a priestlie vestiment, and idoles: and he :: filled the hand of one of his sonnes, and he became his priest. <sup>6</sup> In those daies there was not a king in Israel, but euerie one did that, which semed right to him self. <sup>7</sup> There was also an other yong man of Bethlehem Iuda, of the kinred therof: and he was a Leuite, and dwelt there. <sup>8</sup> And going forth out of the citie of Bethlehem, he would soiourne wheresoeuer he should find it commodious for him. And when he was come into mount Ephraim, making his iourney, and had turned aside a litle into the house of Michas, <sup>9</sup> he was demanded of him whence he came. Who answered: I am a Leuite of Bethlehem Iuda, and I goe to dwel where I shal be able, and shal perceiue it to be profitable for me. <sup>10</sup> And Michas
