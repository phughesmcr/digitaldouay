Which when Manue and his wife had seene, they fel flatte on the ground, <sup>21</sup> and the Angel of our Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue vnderstood that it was an Angel of our Lord, <sup>22</sup> and he said to his wife: Dying we shal die, because we haue seene God. <sup>23</sup> To whom his wife answered: If our Lord would haue killed vs, he would not haue taken of our handes holocaustes and libamentes, neither would he haue shewed vs al these thinges, nor haue told vs these thinges that are to come. <sup>24</sup> She therfore bare a sonne, and called his name Samson. And the child grewe, and our Lord blessed him. <sup>25</sup> And the Spirit of our Lord beganne to be with him in the campe of Dan betwixt Saraa and Esthaol.
