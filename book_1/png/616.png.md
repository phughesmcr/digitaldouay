And when Saul was yet in Galgal, al the people was sore afrayd, which folowed him. <sup>8</sup> And he expected seuen daies according to the appointment of Samuel, and Samuel came not into Galgal, and the people slipt away from him. <sup>9</sup> Saul therfore said: Bring me the holocauste, and the pacifiques. And he offered the holocauste. <sup>10</sup> And when he had finished offering the holocauste, behold Samuel came: and Saul went forth to mete him & salute him. <sup>11</sup> And Samuel spake to him: What hast thou done?
