in the valley on the North side of the high hil. <sup>1</sup>And our Lord said to Gedeon: There is much people with thee, neither shal Madian be deliuered into their hand: lest Israel glorie against me, and say: By myne owne force I am deliue­red. <sup>2</sup>Speake to the people, and proclame in al their hea­ring: He that is fearful and timorous, let him returne. And they departed from mount Galaad, and there returned two and twentie thousand men, and onlie ten thousand remained. <sup>3</sup>And our Lord said to Gedeon: Yet there is a great multi­tude, leade them to the waters, and there I wil proue them: and of whom I shal tel thee that he goe with thee, let him goe: whom I shal forbid to goe, let him returne. <sup>4</sup>And when the people were come downe to the waters, our Lord said to Gedeon: They that shal lappe the water with their tongues, as dogges are wont to lappe, thou shalt separate them apart: but they that shal drinke bowing downe their knees, shal be on the other part. <sup>5</sup>The number therfore of them that had lapped water, their hand casting it to their mouth, was three hundred men: and al the rest of the multitude had drunck kneeling. <sup>6</sup>And our Lord said to Gedeon: In the three hundred men, that lapped water, I wil deliuer you, and geue Madian in thy hand: but let al the rest of the multitude re­turne into their place. <sup>7</sup>Taking therfore victuals and trum­pettes according to the number, al the rest of the multitude he commanded to depart to their tabernacles: and him selfe with the three hundred gaue him selfe to the battel.
