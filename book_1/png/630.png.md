and to me they haue geuen a thousand: what remayneth for him but only the kingdom? <sup>9</sup> Therefore Saul did not looke vpon Dauid with right eies from that day and afterward. <sup>10</sup> And a day after, the euil spirit of God inuaded Saul, and he prophecied in the middes of his house. And Dauid played with his hand as euery day. And Saul held a speare, <sup>11</sup> and threw it, thinking that he could naile Dauid to the wal, and Dauid declined from his face the second time. <sup>12</sup> And Saul feared Dauid because our Lord was with him, and was departed from himself. <sup>13</sup> Saul therefore remoued him from him, and made him a tribune ouer a thousand men, and he went out and came in before al the people. <sup>14</sup> Also in al his wayes, Dauid delt wisely, and our Lord was with him. <sup>15</sup> Saul therefore saw that he was exceding wise, and he beganne to beware of him. <sup>16</sup> But al Israel, and Iuda loued Dauid, for he came in and went out before them. <sup>17</sup> And Saul sayd to Dauid: Behold my elder daughter Merob, her wil I geue thee to wife, only be thou a valyant man, and fight the battels of our Lord. And Saul thought saying: Be not my hand vpon him, but let the handes of the Philistians be vpon him. <sup>18</sup> And Dauid sayd to Saul: What am I, or what is my life, or the kindred of my father in Israel, that I should be made the sonne in lawe of the king? <sup>19</sup> And it came to passe, at what time, Merob the daughter of Saul should haue beene geuen to Dauid, she was geuen to Hadriel the Molathite to wife. <sup>20</sup> But Dauid loued Michol the other daughter of Saul. And it was told Saul, and it pleased him. <sup>21</sup> And Saul sayd: I wil geue her to him, that she may be a scandal vnto him, and that the hand of the Philistians may be vpon him. And Saul sayd to Dauid: In two thinges thou shalt be my sonne in lawe this day. <sup>22</sup> And Saul commanded his seruantes: Speake to Dauid secretly out of my presence, saying: Behold thou pleasest the King, and al his seruantes loue thee. Now therefore be thou the kinges sonne in lawe. <sup>23</sup> And the seruantes of Saul spake al these wordes in the eares of Dauid. And Dauid sayd: Doth it seme vnto you a smal matter to be the sonne in lawe of a King? But I am a poore man, and of smal ability. <sup>24</sup> And the seruantes of Saul reported, saying: These maner of wordes hath Dauid spoken. <sup>25</sup> And Saul sayd: Speake thus to Dauid: The king nedeth no dowrie, but only an hundred prepuces of the Philistians, that reuenge may be made of the kinges enemies.

<aside>importe dimi-nishing of an other, he that is proud, as Saul now was, is moued to enuie and ma-lice, more and more as the vertues of the other and his praises do in-crease.</aside>
