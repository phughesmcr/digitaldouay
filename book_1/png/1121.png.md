CHAP. XXXVI.

Tet further Eliu sheweth, that God by his powre and wisdome guideth to euerie one that is iust. <sup>16</sup>inferring (falsly) that al Iobs affliction is for his sinnes. <sup>22</sup>discoursing stil of Gods powre, wisdom, and prouidence.

<sup>1</sup>Eliv also adding speake these wordes: <sup>2</sup>Beare with me a litle, and I wil shew to thee: for as yet I haue what to speake for God. <sup>3</sup>I wil repete my knowledge from the beginning, and I wil proue my maker iust. <sup>4</sup>For in deede my wordes are without lye, and perfect knowledge shal be proued to thee. <sup>5</sup>God doth not cast away the mightie, wher-as himself also is mightie. <sup>6</sup>But he saueth not the impious, and he giueth iudgement to the poore. <sup>7</sup>He shal not take away his eyes from the iust, and he placeth kinges in the throne for euer, and there they are extolled. <sup>8</sup>And if they shal be in chaines, and be bound with the ropes of pouertie, <sup>9</sup>He shal shew them their workes, and their wicked deedes, because they haue bene violent. <sup>10</sup>He also shal reuele their eare, to chastise them: and shal speake, that they may returne from iniquitie: <sup>11</sup>If they shal heare and obserue, they shal accomplish their daies in good, and their yeares in glorie. <sup>12</sup>But if they heare not they shal passe by the sworde, and shal be consumed in folie. <sup>13</sup>Dissemblers and craftie men prouoke the wrath of God, neither shal they crie when they are bound. <sup>14</sup>Their soule shal dye in tempest, & their life among the effeminates. <sup>15</sup>He shal deliuer the poore out of his distresse, and shal reuele his eare in tribulation. <sup>16</sup>Therfore he shal saue thee most largely out of the narrow mouth, and not hauing foundation vnder it: and the quietnesse of thy table shal be ful of fatnesse. <sup>17</sup>Thy cause is iudged as an impious mans, cause and iudgement thou shalt receiue. <sup>18</sup>Let not therfore anger ouercome thee, that thou oppresse anie man: neither let multitude of giftes incline thee. <sup>19</sup>Lay downe thy greatnes without tribulation, and al the puissant of strength. <sup>20</sup>Protract not the night, that peoples may come vp for them. <sup>21</sup>Beware thou decline not to iniquitie: for thou hast begunne to folow it after miserie. <sup>22</sup>Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like to him among the lawgeuers. <sup>23</sup>Who can search his waies? or who can say to him: Thou hast
