<sup>38</sup> And Saul sayd: Bring hither al the corners of the people: and know, and see by whom this sinne hath chanced to day. <sup>39</sup> Our Lord the sauiour of Israel liueth, that if it were done by Ionathas my sonne, he shal die without reuoking. Whereunto none of the people gaynesayed him. <sup>40</sup> And he sayd to al Israel: Be you seperated into one side, and I with Ionathas my sonne wil be on the other side. And the people answered Saul: Doe what semeth good in thyn eies. <sup>41</sup> And Saul sayd to our Lord: Lord God of Israel, geue a signe: and Ionathas was caught and Saul, and the people went forth. <sup>42</sup> And Saul sayd: Cast ye lotte betwen me, and Ionathas my sonne. And Ionathas was taken. <sup>43</sup> And Saul sayd to Ionathas: Tel me what thou hast done. And Ionathas told him, and sayd: Tasting I tasted in the tippe of the rod, which was in myn hand a litle honie, and behold I die. <sup>44</sup> And Saul sayd: These thinges doe God to me, and these thinges adde he, that dying thou shalt die Ionathas. <sup>45</sup> And the people said to Saul: Shal Ionathas then die, which hath made this great saluation in Israel? this is vnlawful: our Lord liueth, if there shal fal a heare from his head vpon the ground, because with God hath he wrought to day. The people therefore deliuered Ionathas, that he should not die. <sup>46</sup> And Saul retyred, neither did he pursew the Philistiims: moreouer the Philistiims departed into their places. <sup>47</sup> And Saul, his kingdom being established ouer Israel, fought round about against al his enemies, against Moab, and the children of Ammon, and Edom, and the kinges of Soba, and the Philistians: and whither soeuer he turned him self, he ouercame. <sup>48</sup> And gathering together an armie, he stroke Amalec, and deliuered Israel from the hand of the spoylers thereof. <sup>49</sup> And the sonnes of Saul, were Ionathas and Iesui, and Melchisua: and the names of his two daughters, the name of the first borne Merob, and the name of the yonger Michol. <sup>50</sup> And the name of Sauls wife, Achinoam the daughter of Achimaas: and the name of the prince of his host Abner, the sonne of Ner, the cosin german of Saul by the father. <sup>51</sup> Moreouer Cis was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner, the sonne of Abiel. <sup>52</sup> And there was mightie battel agaynst the Philisthians al the dayes of Saul. For whomsoever Saul had seene a valiant man, and fitte for battel, he ioyned him to him self.
