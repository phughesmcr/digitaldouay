# THE BOOKE ANNOTATIONS.
## CHAP. V.

1. Thyself some of the Sainctes ] Eliphaz prouoking Iob to produce some of his opinion, or to seeke the helpe and patronage of some Sainct in his cause, plainly sheweth the common faith and practise of inuocating Sainctes in that time. Elsit had benne a friuolous speach, which is not to be imputed to a sensible wise man as he was. For it appeareth by the drift of his reasoning, that he supposed some of Gods special seruantes would maintaine a good cause; but that Iobs cause was such as neither God, nor holie Angel, nor good man would defend, and therfore boldly prouoked him to this trial, presuming that he should finde no such patron. Neither did he wil Iob in these wordes to cal vpon God only, for he could not cite (or call) to trial God some of the Sainctes: but must meane some other holie person. And it is clere by the Septuaginta Interpreters, that Eliphaz willed Iob to inuocate the Angels, saying: Inuocate if anie wil answer thee, or if thou shalt see some of the holie Angels. S. Gregorie expoundeth it to the same sense, that Sainctes were to be inuocated in a good cause, but, that Eliphaz here dispising and deriding holie Iob, sayd to him: Thou canst not find Sainctis thy helpers in affliction, whom thou wouldst not haue thy fellowes in prosperitie.

## CHAP. VI.

Iob answereth the obiections of Eliphaz, shewing that in deede the calamitie which he suffereth is much greater than his sinnes deserue; and therfore his lamentation is excusable. 8. wisheth (if it so please God) to be quite dead. 13. complaineth that his freindes are become his aduersaries. 16. grauely expostulated that they reprehend him, 22. and helpe him not.

<sup>1</sup>BVt Iob answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup>Would God my sinnes were weyed, whereby I haue deserued wrath, and the calamitie, which I suffer in a balance. <sup>3</sup>As the sand of the sea this would appeare heauier, wherfore my wordes also are ful of sorrow: <sup>4</sup>Because the arrowes of our Lord be in me, the indignation whereof drinketh vp my spirit, and the terrours of our Lord warre agaynst me. <sup>5</sup>Wil the wilde asse crie when he hath grasse? or the oxe loweth when he shal stand before the ful manger? <sup>6</sup>Or can an vnsauerie thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man tast that which being tasted bringeth death? <sup>7</sup>The thinges which before my soule would not touch, now for anguish are my meates. <sup>8</sup>Who wil graunt that my petition may come: and that God would geue me that which I expect? <sup>9</sup>And he that hath begune, the same would loose his hand, and cut me of? <sup>10</sup>And this might be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare
