and flesh in the morning, in like maner bread and flesh in the
euening, and he dranke of the torrent. <sup>7</sup> But after certayne
daies the torrent was dried: for it had not rayned vpon the
earth. <sup>8</sup> Therefore the word of our Lord came to him, saying:
<sup>9</sup> Arise, and goe into Sarepha of the Sidonians, and thou
shalt tarie there: for I haue commanded a wydow woman
there to feede thee. <sup>10</sup> He arose, and went into Sarepha. And
when he was come to the gate of the citie, the wydow woman
appeared to him gathering stickes, and he called her, and
sayd to her: Geue me a litle water in a vessel, that I may drinke.
<sup>11</sup> And when she went to fetch it, he cried after her saying:
Bring me also, I beseche thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
<sup>12</sup> Who answered: Our Lord thy God liueth, I haue no bread,
but so much meale in a potte as a hand can hold, and a litle oile
in a vessel: behold I gather two stickes, that I may goe in, and
dresse it for me and my sonne, that we may eate, and die.
<sup>13</sup> To whom Elias sayd: feare not, but goe, and doe as thou
hast sayd: but first make for me of the same meale a litle harth
cake, and bring it to me: and for thy self and thy sonne thou
shalt make afterward. <sup>14</sup> For thus sayth our Lord the God of
Israel: The potte of meale shal not fayle, nor the vessel of
oile be diminished vntil the day, wherin our Lord wil geue
rayne vpon the face of the earth. <sup>15</sup> Who went and did according
to the word of Elias: and he did eate, and she, and her
house: and from that day <sup>16</sup> the pot of meale fayled not, and
the vessel of oyle was not diminished, according to the word
of our Lord, which he spake in the hand of Elias. <sup>17</sup> And it
came to passe after these thinges, the sonne of the woman, the
goodwife of the house, fel sicke, and the sickenesse was verie
vehement so that there remayned no breath in him. <sup>18</sup> She
therfore sayd to Elias: What is to me and thee thou man of
God? comest thou vnto me, that myne iniquities might be remembered,
and thou mightest kil my sonne? <sup>19</sup> And Elias sayd
to her: Geue me thy sonne. And he tooke him from her bosome,
and caried him into the vpper chamber where himself
abode, and layd him vpon his bed. <sup>20</sup> And he cried to our
Lord, and sayd: O Lord my God, what, the widow also with
whom I am after a sorte susteyned, hast thou afflicted, that thou
wouldest kil her sonne? <sup>21</sup> And he stretched forth, & measured
him selfe vpon the childe three tymes, & he cried to our Lord,
and sayd: O Lord my God, let the soule of this childe, I beseche

[^1]: To this question (sayth S. Augustin) the prophet answered in spirit: No: For God killed not this childe to afflict so good a mother, but to confirme her in true religion, & to comforte her by raysing him from death. So Lazarus died not to remaine dead, but to lie raysed to life, for Gods more glorie: *Ioan. 11. n. 4.* *s. Aug. li. 2. q. 5. ad Simplici.*
