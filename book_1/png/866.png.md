people, 4. disposeth the offices of Leuites. 8. and maketh a Psalme of praise
to God.*

<sup>1</sup> THEY therfore brought the Arke of God, and set it in
the middes of the tabernacle, which Dauid had pitched
for it: and they offered holocaustes, and pacifiques before
God. <sup>2</sup> And when Dauid had finished offering holocaustes,
and pacifiques, he blessed the people in the name of our
Lord. <sup>3</sup> And he diuided to al through out euerie one, from
man vnto woman a loafe of bread, and a peece of rosted
beefe, and flower fryed with oile. <sup>4</sup> And he appoynted be-
fore the Arke of our Lord of the Leuites, that should mini-
ster, and should remember his workes, & glorifie, and prayse
our Lord the God of Israel: <sup>5</sup> Asaph the prince, and the se-
cond after him Zacharias: moreouer Iahiel, and Semiramoth,
and Iehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, & Obed-
edom: and Iehiel ouer the instrumentes of psalterie, and the
harpes: & Asaph to sound vpon the cymbals: <sup>6</sup> but Banaias,
and Iaziel priestes, to sound the trumpet continually before
the Arke of the couenant of our Lord. <sup>7</sup> In that day Dauid
made Asaph, prince to confesse to our Lord and his brethren.
<sup>8</sup> Confesse ye to our Lord, and inuocate his name: make
his inuentions knowen among the peoples. <sup>9</sup> Chaunt
to him, and sing to him: and tel ye al his meruelous thinges.
<sup>10</sup> Prayse ye his holie name: let the hart of them that reioyce,
seeke our Lord. <sup>11</sup> Seeke ye our Lord, and his powre:
