<sup>6</sup>she might have licence to goe forth, in the night and before day to prayer, and to beseech our Lord. And he commanded his chamberleynes, that as it pleased her, she should goe out & come in to adore her God for three dayes. <sup>7</sup>And she went forth in the nightes into the vale of Bethulia, and washed her self in a fountaine of water. <sup>8</sup>And as she came vp, she prayed our Lord the God of Israel, that he would direct her way to the deliuerie of his people. <sup>9</sup>And going in, she remayned pure in the tabernacle, vntil she tooke her owne meate in the euening. <sup>10</sup>And it came to passe in the fourth day, Holofernes made a supper to his seruantes, and sayd to Vagao his eunuch: Goe, and perswade that Hebrew woman, that she consent of her owne accord to dwel with me. <sup>11</sup>For it is a foule thing with the Assyrians, if a woman mocke a man in doing, that she passe free from him. <sup>12</sup>Then Vagao went in to Iudith, & said: Let not the good yong maide feare to goe in to my Lord, that she may be honoured before his face, that she may eate with him and drinke wine in ioyfulnes. <sup>13</sup>To whom Iudith answered: Who am I, that I should gaynesay my lord? <sup>14</sup>Al that shal be good and best before his eies, wil I doe. And whatsoeuer shal please him, that shal be best to me al the dayes of my life. <sup>15</sup>And she arose, and decked herself with her garmentes, and going in she stood before his face. <sup>16</sup>And the hart of Holofernes was strooken: for he burnt in the concupiscence of her. <sup>17</sup>And Holofernes said to her: Drinke now, and sit downe in ioyfulnes, because thou hast found grace before me. <sup>18</sup>And Iudith said: I wil drinke my lord, because my soule is magnified this day aboue al my dayes. <sup>19</sup>And she tooke, and did eate, and dranke before him those thinges, which her handmayde had prepared her. <sup>20</sup>And Holofernes was made pleasant toward her, and dranke wine exceeding much, so much as he had neuer drunke in his life?
