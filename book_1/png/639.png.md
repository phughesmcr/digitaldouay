sted with an ephod of linnen. <sup>19</sup> And Nobe the citie of the
priests, he stroke in the edge of the sword, men and wemen,
and children, and sucklinge, and oxe and asse, and shepe in

CHAP. XXIII.

<aside>The citie of Ceila oppugned by the Philistims is releued by Dauid. 7. Who fearing to be there betrayed, 13. fleeth into the desert of Ziph. 16. Ionathas repayreth secretly to him, and they confirme againe their former league. 19.
