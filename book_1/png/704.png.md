For Dauids sinne in numbring the people, 11. three sortes of punishments
are proposed to his election: 14. of which he chooseth the plague: and
seuentie thousand die in three dayes. 16. God sheweth mercie. 17. Dauid

from Dan to Bersabee, and number ye the people, that I may
know the number therof. <sup>3</sup>And Ioab sayd to the king: Our

and agayne multiplie it an hundred fold in the sight of my
lord the king: but what meaneth my lord the king by this
kind of thing? <sup>4</sup>Howbeit the kinges word more preuailed

they had passed Iordan, they came into Aroer to the right
hand of the citie, which is in the Vale of Gad. <sup>6</sup>And by Iazer
they passed into Galaad, and into the lower countrie of
Hodsi, and they came into the wooddie countrie of Dan. And
going about neere Sidon, <sup>7</sup>they passed nigh to the walles of
Tyre, and al the land of the Heueite, and the Chananeite,
and they came to the south of Iuda into Bersabee: <sup>8</sup>and ha-
uing viewed the whole land, after nine monethes and twentie
dayes, they were come to Ierusalem. <sup>9</sup>Ioab therfore gaue
the number of the description of the people to the king, and
