772 FOVRTH BOOKE Of Isi. Ioram. Eliseus.

Minister, or shewed disobedience, then thought, that he refrayed for religion: whereas in our case, yet so few do such temporal seruice, about the king in the church: and such as do carrie the sword, scepter, or the like, are accounted of that religion, which is there practised; except they manifest the contrarie, as this man did, and our men commonly do not. Yea if anie do say they are Catholiques, and yet goe to the Protestantes church, they are counted of that rank, S. Paul speaketh of, which confesse they know God, but denie him in their deedes. And those which refuse such an office, can not be iudged disloyal, because it is sufficiently knowne, that Catholiques refuse of mere conscience. An other most especial difference is in the thinges demanded. This Syrian promising expressly before the Prophet, and his owne great trayne, that he would neuer againe serue false goddes, and that he would serue the onlie true God, and for that purpose caried earth with him, to make an Altar for Sacrifice, and returning home preached the miracle wrought in himself, desired not to doe anie thing, whereby he might seme to serue an Idol: but that when the king leaning vpon him, should adore Remmon, he might bow with his maister, not adoring the idol, for he resolued and promised the contrarie, but adoring God Almightie in whom now he beleued. And this the Prophet approued, in that time, place, and person to be lawful. But those that now in England goe to Protestants seruice, or sermons, do neither publikly renounce al heresies, nor professe to frequent Masse, the true Sacrifice of the Christian Church, nor auouch the erecting of an Altar, but goe to church, to shew their selues obedient to the Parliament law, which abandoned the true Diuine Seruice, and in place therof appointed & commanded al to be present at a new forme of common prayer, thereby making it a distinctiue signe of conformitie, and participation in that religion, which these dissenters in their consciences know to be false.

This example therfore doth in no sorte warrant their going to the heretical church: but contrariwise admonisheth al to take resolution in our case (as Naaman did in his) of our Eliseus, or spiritual Superior, and if he should say: Goe in peace, then might they pleade an excuse, but he sayth: None can goe without incurring excommunication, and eternal damnation. The case being so much different from Naamans. It is in deede more like to that of Eleazarus, and other Machabees, who were commanded by raging tyrants, to depart from the law of God, and their fathers. Which by no meanes was lawful to doe, nor to make shew of doing it, but rather to dye, as they did most gloriously.

And the king commandeth to kil Eliseus.

<sup>1</sup>AND the children of the prophetes sayd to Eliseus: Behold the place, wherin we dwel before thee is streite for vs. <sup>2</sup>Let vs goe as far as Iordan, and take out of the wood euerie man some timber, that we may build there a place to dwel in. Who said: Goe. <sup>3</sup>And one of them sayd: Come therfore thou also with thy seruantes. He answered: I wil come
