David.

<aside>By this it appeareth that David consulted God by the high priest, and the high priest for this purpose ioyned the priestlie ornament called Ephod to the Rationale, and so had reuelatio from God.</aside>

First booke

David understood, that Saul secretly prepared euil against him, he sayd to Abiathar the priest: Applie the Ephod. <sup>10</sup>And David sayd: Lord God of Israel, thy seruant hath heard a bruite, that Saul determineth to come into Ceila, to destroy the citie for me: <sup>11</sup>Wil the men of Ceila deliuer me into his handes? and wil Saul come downe, as thy seruant hath heard? Lord God of Israel tel thy seruant. And our Lord sayd: He wil come downe. <sup>12</sup>And David said: Wil the men of Ceila deliuer me, and the men that are with me, into the handes of Saul? And our Lord sayd: They wil deliuer thee. <sup>13</sup>David therefore arose and his men about six hundred, and going out of Ceila, wandered hither and thither vncertaine: and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila, and was saued: for which cause he dissembled to goe forth. <sup>14</sup>But David abode in the desert in most strong places, and he taried in the mount of the desert Ziph, in a shadowed hil. Saul notwithstanding sought him alwayes: and our Lord deliuered him not into his handes. <sup>15</sup>And David saw that Saul was gone forth to seeke his life. Moreouer David was in the desert Ziph, in a wood. <sup>16</sup>And Ionathas the sonne of Saul arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his handes in God: and sayd to him: <sup>17</sup>Feare not: for neither shal the hand of Saul my father finde thee, and thou shalt reigne ouer Israel, and I shal be second to thee, yea and my father knoweth this. <sup>18</sup>Both therefore made a league before our Lord: and David abode in the wood: but Ionathas returned into his house. <sup>19</sup>And the Ziphites went vp vnto Saul in Gabaa, saying: Loe doth not Dauid lye hid with vs in the most safe places of the wood, in the Hil Hachila, which is on the right hand of the desert? <sup>20</sup>Now therefore, as thy soule hath desired, come downe: & it shal be our charge to deliuer him into the kinges handes. <sup>21</sup>And Saul sayd: Blessed be ye of our Lord, because you haue pitied my case. <sup>22</sup>Goe therefore I pray you, and prepare diligently, and deale curiously, and consider the place, where his foote is, and who hath seene him there, for he thinketh of me, that I craftely lye in waite for him. <sup>23</sup>Consider and see al his lurking holes, wherein he is hid, and returne to me with the certeintie of the thing, that I may goe with you. Yea and if he shal stoppe vp himselfe into the earth, I wil search him out among al the thousandes of Iuda. <sup>24</sup>But they rising went into Ziph before Saul: and Dauid and his men were in
