<sup>7</sup> Send me therefore a cunning man, that hath skill to worke in gold, and siluer, brasse, and yron, purple, scarlet, and hyacinth, and that knoweth to make engraued workes with these artificers, which I haue with me in Iewrie, and Ierusalem, whom Dauid my father prepared. <sup>8</sup> But send me also cedar trees, firretrees, and pintrees from Libanus: for I know that thy seruantes haue skil to hew the timber of Libanus, and my seruantes shal be with thy seruantes, <sup>9</sup> that manie trees maybe prepared for me. For the house which I desire to build, is exceeding great, and glorious. <sup>10</sup> Moreouer to the workemen, that shal hew the trees, thy seruantes, I wil geue for victuals of wheat twentie thousand cores, and of barley as manie cores, and of wine twentie thousand, oyle also twentie thousand sates <sup>11</sup> And Hiram the king of Tyre by letters, which he sent to Salomon, sayd: Because the Lord loued his people, therfore hath he made thee to reigne ouer it. <sup>12</sup> And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, that made heauen and earth, who hath geuen to Dauid the king a sonne wise and learned, and of vnderstanding, and prudent, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself. <sup>13</sup> I therefore haue sent thee a man wise and most skilful Hiram, my father, <sup>14</sup> the sonne of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth to worke in gold, and siluer, brasse, and yron, and marble, and in timber, in purple also, and hiacinth, and silke and scarlet: and that knoweth to graue al engrauing, and to deuise wisely whatsoeuer in the worke is necessarie with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord Dauid thy father. <sup>15</sup> The wheate therefore, and barley, and oile, and wine, which thou my lord hast promised, send to thy seruantes. <sup>16</sup> And we wil cut downe the trees out of Libanus, as manie as shal be necessarie for thee, and wil conuey them in boates by the sea vnto Ioppe: and it shal be thy part to transport them into Ierusalem. <sup>17</sup> Salomon therefore numbred al the men, that were proselytes in the land of Israel, after the numbering which Dauid his father numbered, and they were found an hundred fiftie three thousand and six hundred. <sup>18</sup> And he made of them seuentie thousand, that should carie burdens on their shoulders, and eightie thousand, that should cut stones out of the mountaynes: and three thousand and six hundred ouerseers of the worke of the people.
