of Ieroboam arose, and departed, and came into Thersa: and when she entered the threshold of the house, the childe died, <sup>18</sup> and they buried him. And al Israel mourned for him according to the word of our Lord, which he spake in the hand of his seruant Ahias the prophete. <sup>19</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ieroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Israel. <sup>20</sup> And the daies, that Ieroboam reigned, are two and twentie yeares: and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab his sonne reigned for him. <sup>21</sup> Moreouer Roboam the sonne of Salomon reigned in Iuda: one and fourtie yeares old was Roboam when he began to reigne: seuentene yeares reigned he in Ierusalem the citie, which our Lord chose to put his name there, of al the tribes of Israel. And his mothers name was Naama an Ammonite. <sup>22</sup> And Iudas did euil before our Lord, and prouoked him aboue al thinges, that their fathers had done, in their sinnes which they sinned. <sup>23</sup> For they also built them altars, and statues, and groues vpon euerie high hil, and vnder euerie tree ful of grene leaues: <sup>24</sup> yea and effeminates were in the land, and they did al the abominations of the gentiles, which our Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel. <sup>25</sup> And in the fifth yeare of the reigne of Roboam, Sesac the king of Ã†gypt came vp into Ierusalem, <sup>26</sup> and tooke the treasures of the house of our Lord, and the kinges treasures, and al thinges he spoyled: the shieldes also of gold, which Salomon had made: <sup>27</sup> for the which Roboam made brasen shieldes, & deliuered them into the hand of the captaynes of shield bearers, and of them that kept watch before the doore of the kinges house. <sup>28</sup> And when the king went into the house of our Lord, they that had the office to goe before, caried them: and afterward they recaried them to the armourie of the shieldbearers. <sup>29</sup> And the rest of the wordes of Roboam, & al that he did, behold they are written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Iuda. <sup>30</sup> And there was warre between Roboam and Ieroboam alwaies. <sup>31</sup> And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the citie of Dauid: and his mothers name was Naama an Ammonite: and Abias his sonne reigned for him.
