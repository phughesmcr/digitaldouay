the men of Israel issuing out of Masphath pursued the Philistijms, and stroke them vnto the place, that was vnder Bethcar. <sup>12</sup> And Samuel tooke one stone, and layd it between Masphath and Sen: and he called the name of that place, The stone of helpe. And he sayd: Thus farre hath our Lord hol­pen vs. <sup>13</sup> And the Philistijms were humbled, neither added they any more to come into the borders of Israel. Therefore the hand of our Lord was made vpon the Philistijms, al the dayes of Samuel. <sup>14</sup> And the cities, which the Philistijms had taken from Israel, were rendred to Israel, from Accaron vnto Geth, and their borders: and he deliuered Israel from the hand of the Philistijms, and there was peace betwen Israel and the :: Amorrheite. <sup>15</sup> Samuel also iudged Israel al the daies of his life: <sup>16</sup> and he went euerie yeare circuting Bethel and Galgala and Masphath, and iudged Israel in the foresaid places. <sup>17</sup> And he returned into Ramatha: for there was his house, and there he iudged Israel: he built also there an altar to our Lord.
