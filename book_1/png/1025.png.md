said to Tobias: But when thou art entred into thy house forth-
with adore our Lord thy God: and geuing thankes to him
<sup>8</sup> goe to thy father, and kisse him. And immediatly annointe
vpon his eies of this gal of the fish, which thou cariest with
thee. For know thou that forthwith his eies shal be opened,
and thy father shal see the light of heauen, and shal reioice in
the sight of thee. <sup>9</sup> Then ranne the dogge before, which
had beene with them in the way, and coming as it were a mes-
<sup>10</sup> senger with the fawning of his tayle reioysed. And his fa-

his feete: and geuing a seruant his hand, went to meete his
<sup>11</sup> sonne. And receiuing him kissed him, with his wife, and

red God, and geuen thankes, they sate downe together.

<sup>14</sup> fathers eies. And he stayed as it were almost halfe an houre:
& the white blemish began to come out of his eies, as it were
<sup>15</sup> the skinne of an egge. Which Tobias taking drewe from his
<sup>16</sup> eies, and immediatly he receiued sight. And they glorified
God, to wit, himselfe and his wife, and al that knewe him.
<sup>17</sup> And Tobias said: I blesse thee Lord God of Israel, because
thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saued me: and behold I
<sup>18</sup> see Tobias my sonne. After seuen dayes also came in Sara

mels, and much money of his wiues: and that money also,
<sup>19</sup> which he had receiued of Gabelus: and he told his pa-
rentes al the benefites of God, which he had done to him
<sup>20</sup> by the man, that conducted him. And Achior and Nabath
Tobias sisters sonnes came, reioysing at Tobias, and congra-
tulating him for al good thinges, that God had shewed to-
<sup>21</sup> wards him. And for seuen daies making good chere, they
reioysed al with great ioy.
