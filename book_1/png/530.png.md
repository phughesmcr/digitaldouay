In much substance and riches returne to your seates, with
siluer and gold, brasse and yron, and varietie of rayment: di-
uide the praye of your enemies with your brethren. <sup>9</sup> And
the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the halfe
tribe of Manasses returned, and went from the children of
Israel in Silo, which is situated in Chanaan, to enter into
Galaad the Land of their possession, which they had obteyn-
ned according to the commandement of our Lord in the hand
of Moyses. <sup>10</sup> And when they were come to the litle banckes
of Iordan, into the Land of Chanaan, they built beside Ior-
dan an altar of an infinite greatnes. <sup>11</sup> Which thing when
the children of Israel had heard, and certaine messengers had
reported to them that the children of Ruben, and Gad, and
the halfe tribe of Manasses had builded an altar in the Land
of Chanaan, vpon the litle banckes of Iordan, against the
children of Israel: <sup>12</sup> they assembled al in Silo, that they might
goe vp, and fight against them. <sup>13</sup> And in the meane time they
sent to them into the Land of Galaad, Phinees the sonne of
Eleazar the priest, <sup>14</sup> and ten princes with him, one of euerie

the halfe tribe of Manasses into the Land of Galaad, and said
to them: <sup>16</sup> This message doth al the people of our Lord send
to you: What is this transgression? Why haue you forsaken
our Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and
reuolting from the worshippe of him? <sup>17</sup> Is it a smale thing
to you that :: you sinned in Beelphegor, and vntil this pre-
sent day the spotte of this abomination abideth in vs? and
many of the people fel dead. <sup>18</sup> And you to day haue forsaken
our Lord, and to morow his wrath wil rage :: against al Israel.
<sup>19</sup> But if you thinke the land of your possession to be vn-
cleane, passe to the Land, wherein is the tabernacle of our
Lord, and dwel among vs: only that you depart not from
our Lord, and from our companie, an altar being built beside
the altar of our Lord God. <sup>20</sup> Did not Achan the sonne of
Zare transgress the commandement of our Lord, and his
wrath lay vpon al the people of Israel? And he was one man,
and I would he alone had perished in his wicked fact. <sup>21</sup> And
the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the halfe tribe of
Manasses answered the princes of the legacie of Israel: <sup>22</sup> The
most mightie God our Lord, The most mightie God our Lord,
