shall answer: Because they forsooke the couenant of the Lord,
which he made with their fathers, when he brought them
<sup>26</sup> out of the Land of Ã†gypt: <sup>27</sup> and they haue serued strange
goddes, and adored them, whom they knew not, and to
whom they had not beene designed: <sup>28</sup> therfore the furie
of the Lord was wrath against this Land, to bring vpon it al
the curses, that are written in this volume: <sup>29</sup> and he hath
cast them out of their land, in wrath and furie, and in verie
great indignation, and hath throwen them into a strange
land, as this day it is proued. Thinges hidden, to our Lord
God: which are manifest, to vs and to our children for euer,

and wil take thee to him, and bring thee into the Land,
