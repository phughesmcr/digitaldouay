Of Israel Zambri, Amri. OF KINGES. 743

halfe part of the horsemen: and Ela was in Thersa drinking,
and dronken in the house of Arsa the gouernour of Thersa.
<sup>10</sup> Zambri therfore rushing in, stroke and slew him in the seuen and twenteth yeare of Asa the king of Iuda, & he reigned
for him. <sup>11</sup> And when he reigned, and sate vpon his throne,
he stroke al the house of Baasa, and he leaft not of it one that
could pysse agaynst a wal, & his kinsfolke and frendes. <sup>12</sup> And
Zambri destroyed al the house of Baasa, according to the
word of our Lord, that he had spoken to Baasa in the hand of
Iehu the prophet, <sup>13</sup> for al the sinnes of Baasa, and the sinnes
of Ela his sonne, who sinned, and made Israel to sinne, prouoking our Lord the God of Israel in their vanities. <sup>14</sup> But
the rest of the wordes of Ela, and al that he did, are not these
writen in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges
of Israel? <sup>15</sup> In the seuen and twenteth yeare of Asa the king
of Iuda, reigned Zambri seuen daies in Thersa: moreouer the
armie besieged Gebbethon a citie of the Philisthines. <sup>16</sup> And
when they heard that Zambri had rebelled, and slayne the
king, al Israel made Amri their king, who was General of
the warfare ouer Israel that day, in the campe. <sup>17</sup> Amri therfore went vp, and al Israel with him from Gebbethon, and
they besieged Thersa. <sup>18</sup> And Zambri seing that the citie should
be taken, he went into the palace, and burnt him self with
the kinges house: and he died <sup>19</sup> in his sinnes, which he had
sinned doing euil before our Lord, and walking in the way of
Ieroboam, and in his sinne, wherwith he made Israel to sinne.
<sup>20</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Zambri, and of his treason,
and tyrannie, are not these thinges writen in the Booke of
the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Israel? <sup>21</sup> Then was
the people of Israel diuided into two partes: the halfe part of
the people folowed Thebni the sonne of Gineth, to make
him king: and the halfe part Amri. <sup>22</sup> But the people that
was with Amri, preuayled ouer the people that folowed
Thebni the sonne of Gineth: and Thebni died, and Amri
reigned. <sup>23</sup> In the one and thirteth yeare of Asa the king of
Iuda Amri reigned ouer Israel, twelue yeares: in Thersa he
reigned six yeares. <sup>24</sup> And he bought the mount of Samaria
of Somer for two talentes of siluer: and he built it, and he
called the citie which he had built, by the name of Semer the
lord of the mount of Samaria. <sup>25</sup> And Amri did euil in the
sight of our Lord, and wrought wickedly aboue al, that were
