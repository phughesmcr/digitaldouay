IVDGES.

his father and mother said: :: Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, and in al my people, that thou wilt take a wife of the Philisthijms, which are vncircumcised? And Samson said to his father: Take this for me: <sup>4</sup> because she hath pleased mine eyes. † But his parentes knew not that the thing was done of our Lord, and he sought an occasion against the Philisthims. for at that time the Philisthims had dominion ouer Israel. <sup>5</sup> Samson therfore went downe with his father and mother into Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vinyeardes of the towne, there appeared a lions whelpe cruel, and roaring, and mette him. <sup>6</sup> And the Spirit of our Lord came vpon Samson, and he tore the lion, as if he should teare a kidde into peeces, hauing nothing at al in his hand: and this thing he would not tel to his father and mother. <sup>7</sup> And he went downe and <sup>8</sup> spake to the woman, that had pleased his eies. † And after some dayes returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcasse of the lion, and behold there was a swarme of bees in the mouth of the lion and a honie combe. <sup>9</sup> Which when he had taken in his handes, he did eate in the way: and coming to his father and mother, he gaue them part, who also them selues did eate: neither would he for al that tel them, that he had taken the honie from the bodie of the lion. <sup>10</sup> His father therfore went downe to the woman, and made his sonne Samson a feast, for so yong men were accustomed to doe. <sup>11</sup> When the citizens therfore of that place had seene him, they gaue him thirtie companions to be with him. <sup>12</sup> To whom Samson spake: I wil propose you a riddle, which if you shal solue me within the seuen dayes of the feast, I wil geue you thirtie sindones, and as many coates: <sup>13</sup> but if you shal not be able to solue it, you shal geue me thirtie sindones, and cotes of the same number. Who answered him: Propound the riddle, that we may heare it. <sup>14</sup> And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meate, and out of the strong issued forth sweetenes. neither could <sup>15</sup> they for three dayes solue the proposition. † And when the seuenth day was come, they said to the wife of Samson: Speake to thy husband, and vse perswasion to him, that he tel thee what the riddle signifieth. Which thing :: if thou wilt not doe, we wil burne thee, and thy fathers house: haue you therfore called vs to the bridal that you might spoyle vs?
