Five kinges slaine.

<sup>17</sup> in a caue of the citie of Maceda. And it was told Iosue that the fiue kinges were found lying hid in a caue of the citie of Maceda. <sup>18</sup> Who commanded them saying: Rowle great stones into the mouth of the caue, and sette industrious men, which may keepe them shut in: <sup>19</sup> and stand not you stil, but pursue the enemies, and kil al the hindermost of them that flee, neither let them enter into the fortes of their cities, whom our Lord God hath deliuered into your handes. <sup>20</sup> The aduersaries therfore being slaine with a great slaughter, and almost consumed to vtter destruction, they that could escape from Israel, entered into fensed cities. <sup>21</sup> And al the hoste returned to Iosue in Maceda, where then the campe was, safe and the ful number: and no man durst once mutter against the children of Israel? <sup>22</sup> And Iosue commanded, saying: Open the mouth of the caue, and bring forth to me the fiue kinges, that lie hid therin. <sup>23</sup> And the ministers did as it was commanded them: and they brought to him the fiue kinges out of the caue, the king of Ierusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Ierimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon. <sup>24</sup> And when they were brought forth to him, he called al the men of Israel, and said to the princes of the hoste that were with him: Goe, and sette your feete vpon the neckes of these kinges.

Who cast them being taken downe into the caue, wherin they had lyen hid, & put on the mouth therof great stones, which continew vntil this present. <sup>28</sup> The same day Iosue tooke Maceda and stroke it in the edge of the sword, & killed the king & al the inhabitantes therof: he left not in it so much as smale reliques.
