<sup>11</sup> rejoysing and being glad for the good, that our Lord had done to Dauid, and Salomon, and Israel his people. <sup>12</sup> And Salomon accomplished the house of our Lord, and the house of the king, and al that he had disposed in his hart to do, in the house of our Lord, and in his owne house, and he prospered. <sup>13</sup> And our Lord appeared to him by night, and sayd: I haue heard thy prayer, and haue chosen this place to me for a house of sacrifice. <sup>14</sup> If I shal shut heauen, and rayne fal not, and shal bid and command the locust to deuoure the land, and shal send pestilence into my people: <sup>15</sup> and my people being conuerted, vpon whom my name is inuocated, shal beseech me, and seeke out my face, and shal doe penance from their most wicked waies: I also wil heare from heauen, and wil be propitious to their sinnes, and wil saue their land. <sup>16</sup> Mine eies also shal be opened, and mine eares erected to his prayer, that shal pray in this place. <sup>17</sup> For I haue chosen, and haue sanctified this place, that my name may be there for euer, and mine eies and my hart may remaine there al daies. <sup>18</sup> Thou also if thou walke before me, as Dauid thy father walked, and shalt doe according to al thinges, which I haue commanded thee, and shalt keepe my iustices and iudgementes: <sup>19</sup> I wil rayse vp the throne of thy kingdom, as I promised to Dauid thy father, saying: There shal not be taken away of thy stocke a man, that shal be prince in Israel. <sup>20</sup> But if you shal be turned away, and shal forsake my iustices, and my preceptes, which I haue proposed to you, and going shal serue strange goddes, and adore them, <sup>21</sup> I wil plucke you out of my land, which I haue geuen you: and this house, which I haue sanctified to my name, I wil cast away from my face, and wil deliuer it for a parable, and an exemple to al peoples. <sup>22</sup> And this house shal be for a prouerbe to al passengers, and they shal say being astonyshed: Why hath the Lord done so to this land, and to this house? <sup>23</sup> And they shal answer: Because they forsooke the Lord the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, and tooke hold of strange goddes, and adored them, and worshipped them: therfore are al these euils come vpon them.
