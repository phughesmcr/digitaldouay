handes for the right. And the children of Israel sent by him
presentes to Eglon the king of Moab, <sup>16</sup> who made him self
a two edged sword, hauing in the middes a hafte in length
the palme of a hand, and was girded therewith vnder his cas-
socke on the right thigh. <sup>17</sup> And he presented the giftes to
Eglon the king of Moab. And Eglon was exceeding grosse.
<sup>18</sup> And when he had presented the giftes vnto him, he
brought his felowes on the way that came with him. <sup>19</sup> And
returning from Galgal, where the Idols were, he said to the
King: I haue a secrete message to thee Ã´ king. And he com-
manded silence: and al being gone forth, that were about
him, <sup>20</sup> Aod went in to him: and he sate in a sommer cham-
ber alone, and he said: "A word from God I haue to thee.
Who forthwith rose out of his throne. <sup>21</sup> And Aod put forth
his left hand, and tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and
fastened it into his bellie <sup>22</sup> so mightely: that the haft folowed
the blade in the wound, and was closed vp fast with the
most fatte grease. Neither did he plucke out the dagger,
but as he had striken so left it in the bodie: and forthwith by
the secrete partes of nature the ordure of the bellie came
forth. <sup>23</sup> But Aod shutting the doores of the chamber very
diligently, and locking them sure, <sup>24</sup> went out by a posterne
doore. And the kinges seruantes going in, saw the doores of
the chamber shut, and they said: Peraduenture he purgeth
his bellie in the sommer chamber. <sup>25</sup> And expecting long til
they were ashamed, and seeing that no man did open, they
tooke a key: and opening they found their lord on the earth
lying dead. <sup>26</sup> But Aod, whiles they were trubled, escaped,
and passed by the Place of Idols, whence he had returned. And
he came into Seirath: <sup>27</sup> and forthwith the trumpet sounded
in the mount of Ephraim: and the children of Israel went
downe with him, him self going in the fronte. <sup>28</sup> Who said to
them: Folow me: for our Lord hath deliuered our enemies the
Moabites into our handes. And they went downe after him,
and occupied the fordes of Iordan, which bring ouer into
Moab: and they suffered no man to passe: <sup>29</sup> but they stroke
the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand, al stoute and
strong men, none of them could escape. <sup>30</sup> And Moab was
humbled that day vnder the hand of Israel: and the Land
rested eightie yeares. <sup>31</sup> After him was Samgar the sonne of
Anath, who stroke, of the Philisthimes six hundred men with
the culter of a ploughe: and he also defended Israel.
