# The booke

<sup>1</sup>But Eliphaz the Themanite answering, sayd: If we shal begin to speake to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it greuously, but the word conceiued who can hold? <sup>2</sup>Behold thou hast taught manie, & wearie handes thou hast strength-ned: <sup>3</sup>Them that wauered thy wordes haue confirmed, and trembling knees thou hast strengthened: <sup>4</sup>But now a plague is come vpon thee, and thou hast faynted: hath touched thee, and art trubled. <sup>5</sup>Where is thy feare, thy strength, thy patience, and the perfection of thy wayes? <sup>6</sup>Remember I beseech thee, who euer being innocent hath perished? or when haue the iust bene destroyed? <sup>7</sup>Yea rather I houe sene them, that worke iniquitie, and sow sorrowes, & reape them, <sup>8</sup>to haue perished by the blast of God, and with the spirit of his wrath to haue bene consumed. <sup>9</sup>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lionesse, & the teeth of the whelpes of lions are bruised: <sup>10</sup>The tigre hath perished, because he had no praye, and the lions whelpes are destroyed. <sup>11</sup>More-ouer to me there was spoken a secret word, and as it were by stealth hath mine eare receiued the vaines of the whispe-ring therof. <sup>12</sup>In the horrour of a vision by night, when deepe sleepe is wont to hold men, <sup>13</sup>feare held me, and trembling, and al my bones were made sore afrayd: <sup>14</sup>And when the spirit passed in my presence, the heares of my flesh stood vp-right. <sup>15</sup>There stood one, whose countenance I knew not, an image before mine eies, and I heard the voyce as it were of a gentle winde. <sup>16</sup>What, shal man be iustified in compa-rison of God, or shal a man be more pure then his maker? <sup>17</sup>Behold they that serue him, are not stable, and in his Angels he found wickednes: <sup>18</sup>How much more they that inhabite houses of clay, which haue an earthly foundation, shal be consumed as it were of the moth? <sup>19</sup>From morning vntil eue-ning they shal be cut downe: and because none vnderstan-deth, they shal perish foreuer. <sup>20</sup>And they that shal be left, shal be taken away from them: they shal die, and not in wis-dom.
