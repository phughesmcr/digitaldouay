because I haue reiected him, neither doe I iudge according to
the looke of man: for man seeth those thinges which appeare, but our Lord "beholdeth the hart. <sup>8</sup> And Isai called
Aminadab, and brought him before Samuel. Who said:
Neither this hath our Lord chosen. <sup>9</sup> And Isai brought
Samma, of whom he sayd: This also hath not our Lord
chosen. <sup>10</sup> Isai therefore brought his seauen sonnes before
Samuel: and Samuel sayd to Isai: Our Lord hath not chosen
of these. <sup>11</sup> And Samuel sayd to Isai: Are al thy sonnes now
fully come? Who answered: Yet there is left a litle one, and
he feedeth sheepe. And Samuel sayd to Isai: Send, and bring
him: for neither wil we sitte downe til he come hither. <sup>12</sup> He
sent therefore, and brought him. And he was reade and beautiful to behold, and of a comelie face. And our Lord said:
Arise, and annoint him, for he it is. <sup>13</sup> Samuel therefore tooke
the horne of oile, and annointed him in the middes of his
brethren: and the Spirit of our Lord from that day, and so
forward was directed vpon Dauid: and Samuel rising went
into Ramatha. <sup>14</sup> And the Spirit of our Lord departed from
Saul, and a wicked spirit vexed him, :: from our Lord.
<sup>15</sup> And the seruantes of Saul said to him: Behold an euil spirit
of God vexeth thee. <sup>16</sup> Let our lord command, and thy seruantes which are before thee, wil seeke a man skilful to
:: play on the harpe, that when the euil spirit of our Lord shal
take thee, he may play with his hand, and thou beare it more
it more easily. <sup>17</sup> And Saul sayd to his seruantes: Prouide me
therefore some man that playeth wel, and bring him to me.
<sup>18</sup> And one of the seruantes answering, sayd: Behold I haue
seene the sonne of Isai the Bethlehemite skilful to play, and
very valiant in strength, and a warlike man, and wise in his
wordes, and a beautiful man: and our Lord is with him. <sup>19</sup> Saul
therfore sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send vnto me Dauid
thy sonne, which is in the pastures. <sup>20</sup> Isai therefore tooke
an asse loaden with loaues, and a flagon of wine, and one
kidde of the goates, and sent it by the hand of Dauid his sonne
to Saul. <sup>21</sup> And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him:
but he loued him exceedingly, & was made his esquire. <sup>22</sup> And
Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let Dauid stand in my sight: for he
hath found grace in myn eies. <sup>23</sup> Therefore whensoeuer the
euil spirit of our Lord caught Saul, Dauid tooke his harpe, &
strooke with his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and waxed
better, for the euil spirit departed from him.

<aside>:: Naturally (as these men truly iudged) musique helpeth some il disposition of humores, and draweth also the mind from so vehement apprehension of afflictions: but here it seemeth more probable, that God supernaturally reliued Saul by Dauids playing on the harpe, together with his successe deuotion, for more manifest condemnation of the one, and iustification of the other.</aside>
