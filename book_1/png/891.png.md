Salomon.

but hast desired wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayst be able to iudge my people, ouer which I haue made thee king.

<sup>12</sup> Wisdom and knowledge are geuen thee : and riches, and substance and glorie I wil geue thee, soe that none among the kinges neither before thee, nor after thee shal be like thee.

<sup>13</sup> Salomon therfore came from the Excelse of Gabaon into Ierusalem before the tabernacle of couenant, & reigned ouer Israel.

<sup>14</sup> And he gathered to him chariotes and horsemen, and there amounted to him a thousand foure hundred chariotes, and twelue thousand horsemen: and he caused them to be in the cities of the chariotes, and with the king in Ierusalem.

<sup>15</sup> And the king gaue siluer and gold in Ierusalem as stones, & cedar trees as sycomores, which grow in the champaynes in great multitude.

<sup>16</sup> And there were horses brought him from Egypt, and from Coa by the kinges merchantes, which went, and bought by a price,

<sup>17</sup> a chariote of foure horses for six hundred peces of siluer, and an horse for an hundred fiftie: in like maner of al the kingdomes of Hetheites, and of the kinges of Syria market was made.

CHAP. II.

Other workemen being prouided to build the Temple, 7. Salomon procureth a cunning artificer from the king of Tyre, and special timber, 16. to be cutte, and sent from thence.

<sup>1</sup> And Salomon determined to build a house to the name of our Lord, and a palace for himself.

<sup>2</sup> And he numbered seuentie thousand men that caried on their shoulders, and eightie thousand that should hew stones in the mountaynes, and ouerseers of them three thousand six hundred.

<sup>3</sup> He sent also to Hiram the king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with Dauid my father, and didst send him cedar trees, to build him a house, wherin also he dwelt:

<sup>4</sup> so doe with me that I may build a house to the name of our Lord my God, that I may consecrate it to burne incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and to the euerlasting proposition of loaues, and for holocaustes, morning and euening, on the sabbathes also, and the new moones, and the solemnities of our Lord God for euer, which are commanded Israel.

<sup>5</sup> For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great aboue al goddes.

<sup>6</sup> Who then can be able, to build him a worthie house? if heauen, and the heauens of heauens can not conteyne him; how great am I, that I may build him a house?
