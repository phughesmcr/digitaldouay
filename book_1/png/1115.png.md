<sup>1</sup> I have made a covenant with mine eyes, that I would not so much as thinke of a virgin. <sup>2</sup> For what portion should God from above have in me, & inheritance the Omnipotent from on high? <sup>3</sup> Is there not perdition to the wicked man, and alienation to them that worke injustice? <sup>4</sup> Doth not he consider my waies, and number al my steppes? <sup>5</sup> If I have walked in vanitie, and my foote hath hastened in guile: <sup>6</sup> Let him wey me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicitie. <sup>7</sup> If my steppe have declined out of the way, and if mine eie hath folowed my hart, and if spotte hath cleaved to my handes: <sup>8</sup> Let me sowe, and let an other eate it: and let my progenie be plucked vp by the rootes. <sup>9</sup> If my hart hath bene deceived vpon a woman, and if I have lyne in waite at my freinds doore: <sup>10</sup> Let my wife be the harlot of an other man, and let other men lye with her. <sup>11</sup> For this is a hainous thing, and most great iniquitie. <sup>12</sup> It is a fire devouring even to perdition, and rooting vp al thinges that spring. <sup>13</sup> If I have contemned to abide iudgement with my man servant, and my mayd servant, when they had anie controversie against me. <sup>14</sup> For what shal I doe when God shal rise to iudge? and when he shal aske, what shal I answer him? <sup>15</sup> Did not he make me in the wombe that made him also: and did not one forme me in the matrice? <sup>16</sup> If I have denied to the poore, that which they would, and have made the eyes of the widow to expect: <sup>17</sup> If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the pupil hath not eaten therof with me. (<sup>18</sup> Because from mine infancie mercie hath growen with me: and from my mothers wombe it came forth with me.) <sup>19</sup> If I have dispised him that perisheth, for that he had not clothing, and the poore man without wherwithal to cover him: <sup>20</sup> If his sides have not blessed me, & he was not warmed with the flises of my sheepe: <sup>21</sup> If I have lifted vp my hand over the pupil, yea when I saw my self in the gate the superior: <sup>22</sup> Let my shoulder fal from his iuncture, and let my arme with his bones be broken. <sup>23</sup> For I have alwaies feared God as waves swelling vpon me, and his weight I could not beare. <sup>24</sup> If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence. <sup>25</sup> If I have reioysed vpon my great riches, and because my hand found manie thinges. <sup>26</sup> If I saw the sunne when it shined, and the moone going clearly: <sup>27</sup> And my hart in secret reioysed, and I kissed my hand with my mouth.

<aside>wheras: there is a continual warre betwene a chast mind and rebellious flesh, holie Iob made this condition of truee betwene these enimies: that his eye should never give occasion to carnal concupiscence.</aside>
