sed, though frowardlie, yet not as an infidel: I wil not aske: and I wil
not tempt our Lord. *Tea though* Vrias the High Priest by commandment of the same king (4. Reg. 16.) made a new altar in place of Gods Altar, yet he erred not in faith, nor in doctrine, as teaching in Moyses chaire, but in fact onlie, and of frailties for feare of the king, as the king offended in his externall act, to flatter the king of Syria. And in this case God sent Isaias to admonish the king, which Vrias neglected, or durst not do. Likewise Ioram (4. Reg. 8. 2. Par. 21.) Ochozias (2. Par. 22.) Ioas in the latter part of his life, 2. Par. 24. Manasses in the former part of his reigne (4. Reg. 21. 2. Par 33.) and some other kinges of Iuda committing idolatrie, and making others to fall with them, either were not wholly perverted, or at least drew not al with them, For not onlie Prophets, in whose hand (or ministerie) God spake, and reproued those sinnes, but manie others kept their zele of true religion, as appeared in their promptnes to serue God, when by good kinges Asa, Iosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias and others, they were exhorted, or admitted so to do. 4. Reg. 18. 23. 2. Par. 15. 17. 19. 30. 31. 33. 34. &c.

Finally wheras diuers good princes disposed, thinges belonging to Diuine seruice in the temple, correcting faultes, and punishing offenders in that behalfe, (3. Reg. 15. 4. Reg. 18. 23.) they did the same without preiudice of the High Priestes supremacie in spirituall causes, and their godlie actes make nothing for the English Paradox of Laiheadshippe. For superior authoritie, and ordinarie powre is not proued by factes good or euil, but rather by Gods ordinance and institution. For as the factes of vsurpers make no lawfull prescription; so neither the factes of good men, do change Gods general ordinance and law: But are done either by waie of execution, or sometimes by dispensation. Often also by commission and special inspiration of God. As king Dauid by dispensation did eate the lolie bread, which was ordained for Priestes onlie. 1. Reg. 21. He disposed of Priestes and Leuites offices about the Arke of God. Par. 15. 19. by way of execution according to the law. And of the like offices in the Temple (when it should be built) 1. Par. 21. 24. 25. 26. by diuine inspiration. And Salomon by commission from God deposed Abiathar the High Priest, from his office and put Sadoc in his place. 3. Reg. 2. Wherefore albeit good kinges did excellentlie well in calling together the Priestes, and disposing them in their offices, for execution of Gods seruice, yea in commanding what they should do 4. Reg. 18. 19. 22. and in punishing Priestes (4. Reg. 23.) yet they did such thinges as Gods Commissioners, not as ordinarie Superiors in spiritual causes, and stil the ordinarie subordination made by the law, Deut. 17. Num. 27. stood firme and inuiolable, the High Priest supreme Iudge of all doubtes in faith, causes, and quarels in religion, when other subordinate inferior Iudges varied in their iudgements. Of which office Malachias the Prophet (cap. 2.)
