But yet because they were humbled, the wrath of our Lord was turned away from them, neither were they vtterly destroyed: for in <sup>13</sup> Iuda there were found good workes. King Roboam therefore was strengthened in Ierusalem, & reigned: one and fourtie yeares old was he when he beganne to reigne, and he reigned seuentene yeares in Ierusalem, the citie, which our Lord chose, to confirme his name there, out of al the tribes of Israel: <sup>14</sup> and the name of his mother was Naama an Ammonite. And <sup>15</sup> he did euil, and prepared not his hart to seke our Lord. But the workes of Roboam the first and the last are writen in the Bookes of Semeias the Prophete, and of Addo the Seer, and diligently expounded: and Roboam and Ieroboam fought <sup>16</sup> one agaynst the other al their daies. And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid. And Abias his sonne reigned for him.
