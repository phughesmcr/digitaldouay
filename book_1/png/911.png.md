# Paralipomenon

<sup>21</sup> Therefore Abias, his empire being strengthened, tooke fourtene wiues: and he begat two and twentie sonnes, and sixtene daughters. <sup>22</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Abias, and of his waies and wordes, are writen diligently in the Booke of Addo the Prophete.

## Chap. XIII.

*Abias dieth, and his sonne Asa reigneth, destroyeth idolatrie, 6. fortifieth his cities, 9. and ouercometh, by Gods special helpe, the Aethiopians, armie of a million of men.*

<sup>1</sup> And Abias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the Citie of Dauid: and Asa his sonne reigned for him, in whose daies the land was quiet tenne yeares. <sup>2</sup> And Asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight of his God, and he ouerthrew the altars of strange seruice, and the excelses, <sup>3</sup> and brake the statues, and cut downe the groues. <sup>4</sup> And he commanded Iuda that they should seeke our Lord the God of their fathers, and should doe the law, and al the commandementes. <sup>5</sup> And he tooke away out of al the cities of Iuda the altars, and temples, & reigned in peace. <sup>6</sup> He built also fensed cities in Iuda, because he was quiet, and there had no battels risen in his time, our Lord geuing peace. <sup>7</sup> And he sayd to Iuda: Let vs build these cities, and compasse them with walles, and strengthen them with towers, and gates, and lockes, whiles thinges are quiet from battels, because we haue sought our Lord the God of our fathers, and he hath geuen vs peace round about. They therfore did build, <sup>8</sup> and there was no impediment in building. And Asa had in his armie of them that caried shieldes and speares, of Iuda three hundred thousand: and of Beniamin shieldbearers and archers, two hundred eightie thousand, al these were most valiant men. <sup>9</sup> And Zara the Ethiopian with his armie issued forth agaynst them, tenne hundred thousand, and with three <sup>10</sup> hundred chariotes: and he came as far as Maresa. Moreouer Asa went on to meete him, and set his armie in aray to battel in the vale Sephata, which is neere Maresa. <sup>11</sup> And he inuocated our Lord God, and sayd: Lord there is no difference with thee, whether thou helpe in few, or in manie: helpe vs Ã´ Lord our God: for hauing confidence in thee, and in thy name we are come agaynst this multitude. Lord, thou <sup>12</sup> art our God, let not man preuaile agaynst thee. Our Lord
