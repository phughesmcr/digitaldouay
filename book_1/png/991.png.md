# Nehemias

## Chap. VI.

*The enemies guilfully offer to make league with the Iewes 3. but Nehemias procedeth in building the walles: 16. and al bordering nations feare them.*

<sup>1</sup> And it came to passe, when Sanaballat had heard, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enimies, that I did build the wal, and there was no breach remayning in it (how beit at that time I had not put the doores in the gates) <sup>2</sup> Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let vs make a league together in the villages, in the field of Ono: But they thought to doe me euil. <sup>3</sup> I sent therfore messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great worke, and I can not goe downe, lest perhaps it be neglected when I shal come, and descend to you. <sup>4</sup> But they sent to me according to this word, foure times: and I answered them according to the former word. <sup>5</sup> And Sanaballat sent his seruant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this maner: Among the Gentiles it is heard, and Gossem hath sayd, that thou and the Iewes meane to rebel, and therfore thou buildest the wal, and wil aduance thy selfe king ouer them: for which cause <sup>7</sup> thou hast sette vp prophetes also, which should preach of thee in Ierusalem, saying: There is a king in Iurie: The king wil heare of these thinges: therfore come now, that we may take counsel together. <sup>8</sup> And I sent to them, saying: It is not done according to these words, which thou speakest: for thou framest these things of thine owne hart. <sup>9</sup> For al these terrified vs, thinking that our hands would cease from the worke, and we would leaue of.
