<sup>3</sup> Because I wil inuocate the name of our Lord: geue magnificence to our God.

<sup>4</sup> The workes of God be perfect, and al his waies iudgementes: God is faithful, and without any iniquitie, iust and right.

<sup>5</sup> They haue sinned to him, and not his children in filthines: a froward and peruerse generation.

<sup>6</sup> These thinges doest thou render to our Lord thou foolish and vnwise people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made, and created thee?

<sup>7</sup> Remember the old daies, thinke vpon euerie generation: aske thy father, and he wil declare to thee: thy elders, and they wil tel thee.

<sup>8</sup> When the highest diuided the nations: when he separated the sonnes of Adam, he appointed the limites of people according to the number of the children of Israel.

<sup>9</sup> But our Lords part, is his people: Iacob the corde of his inheritance.

<sup>10</sup> He found him in a desert land, in a place of horrour, and of wast wildernes: he ledde him about, and taught him: and kept him as the apple of his eye.

<sup>11</sup> As the eagle prouoking her young to flie, and houering ouer them, hath he spred his winges, and he hath taken him, and caried him on his shoulders.

<sup>12</sup> Our Lord onlie was his guide: and there was not with him a strange God.

<sup>13</sup> He placed him ouer an high land: that he might eate the fruites of the fieldes, that he might sucke honie out of the rocke, and oile out of the hardest stone.

<sup>14</sup> Butter from the heard, and milke of the sheepe with the fatte of lambes, and of rammes the sonnes of Basan: and bucke goates with the marow of wheate, and might drinke the bloud of the grape most pure.

<sup>15</sup> The beloued was made grosse, and spurned: made grosse, fatted, dilated, he left God his maker, and departed from God his saluation.

<sup>16</sup> They prouoked him in strange goddes, and in abominations stirred him to anger.

<sup>17</sup> They immolated to diuels and not to God, to goddes which they knew not: there came new & fresh ones, whom their fathers worshipped not.
