And Iehu sayd: If it please you, let no man goe forth fugitiue out of the citie, lest he goe, and tel in Iezrahel. <sup>16</sup> And he mounted, and went into Iezrahel: for Ioram was sicke there, and Ochozias the king of Iuda was come downe to visite Ioram. <sup>17</sup> The watchman therfore, that stood vpon the toure of Iezrahel, saw the troupe of Iehu coming, & said: I see a troupe.
