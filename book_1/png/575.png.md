<sup>10</sup> We shal enter vnto them being secure, into a most large countrie, and our Lord wil deliuer to vs the place, wherein is penurie of nothing, of those thinges that grow on the earth. <sup>11</sup> There departed therefore from the kinred of Dan, that is to say, from Saraa and Esthaol six hundred men, furnished with warlike armour, <sup>12</sup> and going vp they taried in Cariathiarim of Iuda: which place from that time tooke the name of the Tentes of Dan, and it is at the backe of Cariathiarim. <sup>13</sup> Thence they passed into mount Ephraim. And when <sup>14</sup> they were come to the house of Michas, <sup>15</sup> the fiue men, that before had been sent to view the Land of Lais, said to the rest of their brethren: You know that in these houses there is an Ephod, and Theraphim, and a grauen, and molten god: See what pleaseth you. <sup>15</sup> And when they had turned a litle aside, they entred into the house of the yong man the Leuite, which was in the house of Michas: and saluted him with peaceable <sup>16</sup> wordes. <sup>17</sup> And the six hundred men so as they were armed, stoode before the doore. But they, that were entred the house of the yong man, endeuoured to take away the grauen, the Ephod, and the idols, and molten god, and the priest stoode before the doore, the six hundred most valiant men expecting <sup>18</sup> not farre of. They therefore that were entred tooke the grauen, the Ephod, the theraphim and molten god. To whom <sup>19</sup> the priest said: What doe you? To whom they answered: Hold thy peace, and put thy finger vpon thy mouth and come with vs, that we may haue thee for a father, and a priest. Whether is better for thee, that thou be a priest in the house of one <sup>20</sup> man, or in one tribe and familie in Israel? Which when he had heard, he agreed to their wordes, and tooke the Ephod, <sup>21</sup> and idols, and grauen god, and departed with them. Who when they went forward, and had made the children and the <sup>22</sup> cattel to goe before them, and al that was precious, and were now farre from the house of Michas, the men that dwelt <sup>23</sup> in the house of Michas crying out together folowed, and at their backe began to shoute. Who looking backe, said <sup>24</sup> to Michas: What meanest thou? Why doest thou crie? Who answered: My Goddes, which I made me, you haue taken away, and the priest, and al that I haue, and doe you say: <sup>25</sup> What aileth thee? And the children of Dan said to him: Beware thou speake no more vnto vs, and there come vnto thee men prouoked in mind, and thou with al thy house perish.
