The people often
<sup>8</sup> And Iosue the sonne of Nun, the seruant of our Lord, died, being a hundred and ten yeares old, <sup>9</sup> and they buried him in the borders of his possession in Thamnathsare in the mount of Ephraim, on the North side of mount Gaas. <sup>10</sup> And al that generation was gathered to their fathers: and there rose others, that knew not our Lord, and the workes which he had done with Israel. <sup>11</sup> And the children of Israel did euil in the sight of our Lord, and serued Baalim. <sup>12</sup> And they left our Lord the God of their fathers, that had brought them out of the Land of Ægypt: and folowed strange goddes, and the goddes of the peoples, that dwelt round about them, and adored them: and they prouoked our Lord to anger, <sup>13</sup> leauing him, and seruing Baal and Astaroth. <sup>14</sup> And our Lord being wrath against Israel, deliuered them into the handes of ransackers: who tooke them and sold them to the enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they resist their aduersaries: <sup>15</sup> but whither soeuer they had meant to goe, the hand of our Lord was vpon them, as he spake, and sware to them: and they were vehemently afflicted. <sup>16</sup> And our Lord[^1] raysed vp Iudges, that should deliuer them from the handes of the wasters: but neither would they heare them, <sup>17</sup> fornicating with strange goddes, and adoring them. They did quickly forsake the way, in the which their fathers had gone: and hearing the commandementes of our Lord, they did al thinges contrarie. <sup>18</sup> And when our Lord raysed vp Iudges, in their daies he was moued with mercie, and heard the groninges of the afflicted, and deliuered them from the slaughter of the wasters. <sup>19</sup> But after the Iudge was dead, they returned, and did much worse thinges then their fathers had done, folowing strange goddes seruing them, and adoring them. They left not their inuentions, and the verie hard way, by which they were accustomed to walke. <sup>20</sup> And the furie of our Lord was angrie against Israel, & said: Because this nation hath made my couenant frustrate, which I had made with their fathers, & hath contemned my voice: <sup>21</sup> I also wil not destroy the nations which Iosue did let alone, and died: <sup>22</sup> that in them I may trie Israel, whether they wil keepe the way of the Lord, and walke in it, as their fathers kept it, or no. <sup>23</sup> Our Lord therefore left al these nations, and would not quickly ouerthrow them, neither deliuered them into the handes of Iosue.
