<sup>14</sup> Why doe I teare my flesh with my teeth, & carie my soule in my handes? <sup>15</sup> Although he shal kil me, I wil trust in him: but yet I wil reproue my waies in his sight. <sup>16</sup> And he shal be my sauiour: for no hypocrite shal come in his sight. <sup>17</sup> Heare ye my word, and receiue the obscure sayings with your eares. <sup>18</sup> If I shal be iudged, I know that I shal be found iust. <sup>19</sup> What is he that wil be iudged with me? let him come: why am I consumed holding my peace? <sup>20</sup> Two things only do not to me, and then shal I not be hid from thy face: <sup>21</sup> Make thy hand far from me, and let not thy feare terrifie me. <sup>22</sup> Cal me, and I wil answer thee: or els I wil speake, and doe thou answer me. <sup>23</sup> How great iniquites and sinnes I haue, my wicked deedes and my offences shew thou me. <sup>24</sup> Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thine enemy? <sup>25</sup> Against the leafe, that is violently taken with the wind, thou shewest thy might, and persecutest drie stuble. <sup>26</sup> For thou writest bitternes against me, and wilt consume me with the sinnes of my youth. <sup>27</sup> Thou hast put my feete in the stockes, and hast obserued al my pathes, and hast considered the steppes of my feete. <sup>28</sup> Who as rottenes am to be consumed, and as a garment, that is eaten of the moth.
