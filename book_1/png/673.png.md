OF KINGES. 653

there was battel prepared against him, both before him
and behind him, he piked out of al the chosen of Israel, and
<sup>10</sup> directed his armie agaynst the Syrian: and the rest of the
people he deliuered to Abisai his brother, who directed his
<sup>11</sup> armie against the children of Ammon. And Ioab sayd: If
the Syrian shal preuayle against me, thou shalt ayde me: and
if the children of Ammon shal preuayle agaynst thee, I wil
<sup>12</sup> ayde thee. Play the man, and let vs fight for our people, and
the citie of our God: and our Lord wil doe that which is good
<sup>13</sup> in his sight. Ioab therefore and the people that were with
him, began to fight against the Syrians: who immediatly fled
<sup>14</sup> from his face. And the children of Ammon seing that the
Syrians were fled, they also fled from the face of Abisai, and
entred into the citie: and Ioab returned from the children of

ayde Adarezer, seing them selues ouercorne of Israel, were
afrayd and fled eight & fiftie thousand before Israel. And they
made peace with Israel: and serued them, and the Syrians were
afrayd any more to ayde the children of Ammon.

<sup>1</sup> AND it came to passe the yeare turning about, at such
time when kinges are wont to procede to battels, Dauid
sent Ioab, and his seruantes with him, and al Israel, and they
