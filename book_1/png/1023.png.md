ANNOTATIONS.
Chap. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X.

[^1] Taried long because of the Mariage.) Out of this example of a holie Mariage betwen yong Tobias and Sara, described in the fiue precedent chapters, some special good lessons may be briefly gathered, for the instruction & consolation of such as are to marie, or be already maried. Not that either al, or onlie the same obseruations perteine now to christian Mariage, but that al Christians may see, how orderly godlie persons proceded in making, and performing this holie contract in the old Testament, and therby lerne, that more perfection is required in Christian Matrimonie, being now (as then it was not) a holie Sacrament, signifying the Vnion betwen Christ & his Church: and geuing peculiar Grace to the parties (if themselues hinder it not) to beare more easily the incident burdens, and rightly to fulfil the proper duties of man and wife, according to the godlie instruction of the Roman Catechisme. Al that we shal here note, may be reduced to two heades, or principal partes. For in this Mariage there were certaine necessarie, and as it were essential pointes, without which it had not bene a lawful or right contract: Other accessarie ceremonies, and Rites were also very conuenient, for the more solemnitie and better performance therof. As the like of both sortes are now, but more perfect in Christian Mariages. In the former kind, first of al, *the end of Mariage* was proposed by the Angel, and desired by the parties. *chap. 6. v. 22. ch. 7. v. 9. not for pleasure but for children, and posteritie, by which God might be blessed and serued*: Secondly Mariage must be *betwen lawful persons*, For the seruantes of God could not lawfully match, neither with Infideles, nor with ouer nere kinred, but in conuenient degrees, and that ordinarily in the same Tribe. ch. 7. v. 14. as the law of Moyses prescribed. Thirdly, *the parents mutual consent, and the good wil of parentes was also requisite. ch. 7. v. 15. 16. 20.* These principal pointes premised; for the due solemnization other Rites were

<aside>internal sorrow in their hart (Rom. 9.) vexing (with what tempo-ral losse soe-uer) the salua-tion of their bre-thren, kinsmen, and countrie-men: some ho-ping more confidently and comfor-ting others, that Christ wil againe illumi-nate our whole nation, as sight was restored to old Tobias.</aside>
