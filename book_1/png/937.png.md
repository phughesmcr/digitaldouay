<sup>20</sup> And Ezechias the king rising early, assembled al the princes of the citie, and went up into the house of our Lord:

<sup>21</sup> and they offered together seven oxen, and seven rammes, seven lambes, and seven buckgoates for sinne, for the kingdom, for the sanctuarie, for Iuda, and he sayd to the Priestes the children of Aaron, that they should offer them upon the altar of our Lord.

<sup>23</sup> They brought the buckgoates for sinne before the king, and the whole multitude, and they put their handes upon them:

<sup>24</sup> and the Priestes immolated them, and sprinkled their bloud on the altar for an expiation of al Israel: for the king had commanded for al Israel, that holocaust should be made, and for sinne.

<sup>25</sup> He appoynted also the Levites in the house of our Lord with cymbals, and psalteries, and harpes according to the disposition of David the king, and of Gad the Seer, and of Nathan the Prophete: for it was the precept of our Lord by the hand of his prophetes.
