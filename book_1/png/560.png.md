Iephte.

CHAP. XI.

Iephte reiected by his brethren, is intreated by the ancientes of Galaad to returne and fight for them against the Ammonites. 11. With whom he first pleadeth the cause of Israel by iust reasons, 26. and long prescription. But they persisting obstinate, he (30. inconsideratly vowing) 32. ouerthroweth them, 34. and sacrificeth his onlie daughter.

THERE was at that time Iephte the Galaadite a most va- <sup>1</sup>
liant man and a warrier, the sonne of a woman that was
an harlot, who was borne of Galaad. † And Galaad had a <sup>2</sup>
wife of whom he had sonnes: who after they were growen,
cast out Iephte, saying: Thou canst not be heyre in the house
of our father, because thou art borne of an other mother.
† Whom he fleeing and auoyding, dwelt in the Land of Tob: <sup>3</sup>
and there were gathered to him needie men, and theeuis, and
folowed him as their prince. † In those dayes the children of <sup>4</sup>
Ammon fought against Israel. † who pressing sore vpon them, <sup>5</sup>
the ancientes of Galaad went to take Iephte out of the Land
of Tob to helpe them: † and they said to him: Come and be <sup>6</sup>
our prince, and fight against the children of Ammon. † To <sup>7</sup>
whom he answered: Are not you they that hated me, and cast
me out of my fathers house, and now are come to me forced
by necessitie. † And the princes of Galaad said to Iephte: For <sup>8</sup>
this cause be we now come to thee, that thou goe forth
with vs, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be the
captaine of al that dwel in Galaad. † Iephte also said to them: <sup>9</sup>
If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you
against the children of Ammon, and if our Lord deliuer them
into my handes, shal I be your prince? † Who answered him: <sup>10</sup>
Our Lord which heareth these thinges, him self is media-
tour and witnes that we wil doe as we haue promised.
† Iephte therfore went with the princes of Galaad, and al <sup>11</sup>
the people made him their prince. And Iephte spake al his
wordes before our Lord in Maspha. † And he sent messen- <sup>12</sup>
gers to the king of the children of Ammon, which should
say in his person: What is betwen me and thee, that thou art
come against me, to wast my Land? † To whom he answered: <sup>13</sup>
Because Israel tooke my land, when he ascended out of Æ-
gypt, from the coastes of Arnon vnto Iaboc and Iordan: now
therfore with peace restore the same to me. † By whom Iephte <sup>14</sup>
againe sent word, and commanded them that they should say

<aside>If they had not concurred to his expulsi-on, it might haue suffized to haue sent for him, but in this case the ancientes iud-ged it necesse to goe in per-son, and to in treat him. So Christ was re-iected by the Iewes, and re-turneth not to them til in the end of the world they shal seeke vnto him. s. Aug. q. 49. in Iudic.</aside>
