<sup>28</sup> And the poore people thou wilt saue: and the hautie in thyne eies thou wilt humble.

<sup>29</sup> Because thou art my lampe o Lord: and thou wilt illuminate my darkenes.

<sup>30</sup> For in thee I wil runne girded: in my God I wil leape ouer the wal.

<sup>31</sup> God, his way immaculate, the word of our Lord is examined by fyre: he is the shield of al that trust in him.

<sup>32</sup> Who is God beside our Lord: and who is strong beside our God?

<sup>33</sup> God who hath girded me with strength: and made euen my perfect way.

<sup>34</sup> Making my feete equal with the hartes, and setting me vpon my high places.

<sup>41</sup> Myne enemies thou hast made to turne to me the backe: them that hated me, and I shal destroy them.

<sup>42</sup> They shal crie, and there shal not be to saue, to our Lord, and he wil not heare them.

<sup>43</sup> I wil destroy them as the dust of the earth: as the myre of the streetes wil I bruise and breake them.

<sup>44</sup> Thou wilt saue me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keepe me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, wil serue me.

<sup>45</sup> The children alienes wil resist me, with the hearing of the eare they wil obey me.

<sup>46</sup> The children alienes are fallen away, and shal be strayted in their distresses.

<sup>47</sup> Our lord liueth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my saluation shal be exalted.
