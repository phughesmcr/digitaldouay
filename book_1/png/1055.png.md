ding that the brother, or next kinsman, should marie the widow of him, that died without children, as it semeth she had none, the Greke text affirming that she gaue al her goodes before her death to other kinred. ch. 16. v. 14. Secondly, she was only once maried, ch. 15. v. 13. ch. 16. v. 26. wheras, it is also commendable after wise or oftener mariage at last to abstaine. Thirdly, she was yong, about 35. yeares: for three yeares and a half after that her husband was dead, she was called a yong maide, ch. 12. v. 12. Fourthly, she was of excellent beautie, ch. 8 v. 7. Fiftly exceeding rich. *ibidem*. Sixtly, very noble, especially after the deliuerie of the people from such distresse. ch. 15. v. 10. Seuenthy, for this renowned fact, and for her other great vertue (ch. 8. v. 8) manie principal men desired to marie her, ch. 16. v. 22 Eightly, al the people wished much issue of so noble a stock. ch. 16. v. 25. Ninthly, she liued long in the state of widowhood, about threescore and nine yeares, from. 36. to 105, ch. 16. v. 28. Tenthly, there was great and long peace in al Israel, after that she had releued Bethulia. ch. 16. v. 30. Al which might easily haue inuited an other to haue maried: but her great deuotion, and feruent desire to serue God in a retired austere life, fasting, & praying, ch. 8. v. 6. cutte of al incitements to mariage, and made her before the Gospel, to embrace Euangelical counsel, not commanded, but for better attaining to perfection counseled by our Sauior and S. Paul. *Mat. 19. 1. Cor. 7.*

THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF ESTHER.

Of the authoritie of this booke only two or three ancient writers, doubted, before the councels of Laodicea, and Carthage declared it to be Canonical. Albeit S. Ierom in his time found not certaine partes therof in the Hebrew, and therfore transposed the same to the end of the booke, as now we haue them: yet in the Greke he found al these (sixteene chapters) neither is it vnprobable, that these partes were sometimes in the Hebrew, as were diuers whole bookes which are now lost. But whether they were at anie time in the Hebrew or no, the Church of Christ accounteth the whole Booke of infallible authoritie, reading as wel these partes, as the rest in her publique office. And the councel of Trent (sess. 4.) For more expresse declaration defineth that al the bookes recited in the same Decree (amongst which is Esther) with al the partes therof, as they are accustomed to be read in the Catholique Church, and be conteyned in the old vulgate latin Edition, are sacred and Canonical Scripture.

It conteyneth a particular great danger of the people of Israel, hapening (as is probable) shortly after their general relaxation, & returne of some from the captiuitie of Babylon; and their deliuere from it, through the godlie zele and other vertues of Quene Esther, directed herein by Mardocheus, who being also in imminent danger was deliuered & aduanced. And finally writeth the historie.
