And al the kinges sonnes rysing gatte vp euery one vpon their
mules, and fled. <sup>30</sup> And when they yet went on in their way,
a rumour came to Dauid, saying: Absalom hath stricken al
the kinges sonnes, and there is not leift of them so much as
one. <sup>31</sup> The king therfore rose vp, and rent his garmentes:
and fel vpon the ground, and al his seruantes, that stood
about him, rent their garmentes. <sup>32</sup> But Ionadab the sonne
of Semmaa Dauids brother answering, sayd: Let not my lord
the king thinke, that al the kinges sonnes be slayne: Am-
non only is dead, because he was put in the mouth of Absa-
lom since the day that he rauished Thamar his sister. <sup>33</sup> Now
therefore let not my lord the king put this word vpon his
hart, saying: Al the kinges sonnes are slayne: because Am-
non only is dead. And Absalom fled: and the seruant that
was the scoutewatch, lifted vp his eies, and looked: and
behold much people came by a byway on the side of the
mountayne. <sup>34</sup> And Ionadab sayd to the king: Loe the kinges
sonnes be come: according to the wordes of thy seruant so
is it done. <sup>35</sup> And when he had ceased to speake, the kinges
sonnes also appeared: & entring in they lifted vp their voice,
and wept: yea the king also and al his seruantes bewailed
with an exceding great weeping. <sup>36</sup> Moreouer Absalom
fleing, went to Tholomai the sonne of Ammiud the king of
Gessur, Dauid therefore mourned for his sonne al daies.
<sup>37</sup> And Absalom when he was fled, and come into Gessur,
was there three yeares. <sup>38</sup> And king Dauid ceased to pursew
Absalom, because he was comforted vpon the death of
Amnon.

corne. 31. Then Ioab procureth his accesse to the king.*

AND Ioab the sonne of Saruia, vnderstanding that the
kinges hart was turned to Absalom, <sup>2</sup> he sent to
Thecua, and tooke thence a prudent woman: and he sayd
to her: Feyne that thou mournest, and put on a mourning
garment, and be not annoynted with oyle, that thou mayst
be as a woman now a long tyme mourning for one dead.
