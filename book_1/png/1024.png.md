as with vs the father, or nere freind of the woman, geueth her to be maried to
such a man. Secondly her father prayed that it might wel succeede, *ibidem*, and so
do al freindes now, especially the Priest by the publique prayers of the Church.

*Leauing Sara with the rest of the companie, and the flocke to folow, the Angel
Raphael and Tobias goe before, 5. are ioyfully receiued, 8. Tobias annointeth
his fathers eyes with the fishes gal, and he seeth. 18. Sara arriueth seuen
dayes after with her familie and cattell.*

AND when they returned they came to Charan, which <sup>1</sup>
is in the middeway agaynst Niniue, the eleuenth day.
<sup>2</sup> And the Angel said: Brother Tobias thou knowest how
thou didest leaue thy father. <sup>3</sup> If it please thee therfore, let
vs goe before, and let the families folow softly after vs, toge-
ther with thy wife, and with the beastes. <sup>4</sup> And when this
pleased him that they should goe, Raphael said to Tobias:
Take with thee of the gal of the fish: for it shal be necessarie.
Tobias therfore tooke of that gal and they departed. <sup>5</sup> But
Anna sate beside the way dayly, in the toppe of a hil, from
whence she might see afar of. <sup>6</sup> And whiles she watched his
coming out of that place, she saw afar of, and by and by
perceiued her sonne coming: and running she told her hus-
band saying: Behold thy sonne cometh. <sup>7</sup> And Raphael
