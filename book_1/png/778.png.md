wil goe forth, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of al his
prophetes. And our Lord sayd: Thou shalt deceiue, and
shalt preuayle: goe forth, and doe so. <sup>23</sup> Now therfore
behold our Lord hath geuen the spirite of lying in the mouth
of al thy prophetes, that are here, and our Lord hath
spoken euil agaynst thee. <sup>24</sup> And Sedecias the sonne of Cha-
naana came, and smote Micheas on the cheeke, and sayd:
Hath the Spirit of our Lord leaft me, and hath it spoken to
thee? <sup>25</sup> And Micheas sayd: Thou shalt see in that day, when
thou shalt enter into thy chamber, within the chamber to
be hid. <sup>26</sup> And the king of Israel sayd: Take Micheas, and let
him tarie with Amon the gouernour of the citie, and with
Ioab the sonne of Amelech, <sup>27</sup> and tel them: Thus sayth the
king: Cast this man into prison, and feede him with bread of
tribulation, and water of distresse, til I returne in peace.
<sup>28</sup> And Micheas sayd: If thou returne in peace, our Lord hath
not spoken in me. And he sayd: Heare al ye peoples. <sup>29</sup> Ther-
fore the king of Israel went vp, and Iosaphat the king of
Iuda into Ramoth Galaad. <sup>30</sup> The king of Israel therfore sayd
to Iosaphat: Take armour, and goe into the battel, and put
on thyne owne garmentes. Moreouer the king of Israel
changed his habite, and went into the battel. <sup>31</sup> And the
king of Syria had commanded the princes of his chariotes
thirtie and two, saying: You shal not fight agaynst any lesser,
or greater, but agaynst the king of Israel onlie. <sup>32</sup> When ther-
fore the princes of the chariotes had seene Iosaphat, they su-
spected that he was the king of Israel, and making a violent
assault they fought agaynst him: & Iosaphat cried out. <sup>33</sup> And
the princes of the chariotes perceiued that he was not the
king of Israel, and they ceased from him. <sup>34</sup> And a certaine
man bent his bow, directing the arrow at al aduenture, and
by chance he stroke the king of Israel betwen the lunges
and the stomacke. But he sayd to his cochere: Turne thy
hand, and carrie me out of the armie, because I am greuously
wounded. <sup>35</sup> The battel therfore was fought that day, and
the king of Israel stood in his chariote agaynst the Syrians,
and he died in the euening: & the bloud of the wound ranne
into the middes of the chariote, <sup>36</sup> and the herauld sounded
in al the armie before the sunne sette, saying: Euerie man re-
turne into his citie, and into his countrie. <sup>37</sup> And the king
died, and was carried into Samaria: and they buried the king
in Samaria,
