<sup>9</sup> A smoke arose out of his nosethrils, and a fyre from his mouth shal deuoure: coles were kindled from him.

<sup>10</sup> And he bowed the heauens, and descended: and miste vnder his feete.

<sup>11</sup> And he ascended vpon the Cherubins, and flew: and slidde ouer the winges of the winde.

<sup>12</sup> He put darkenes round about him a couer: stilling waters out of the clowdes of heauen.

<sup>13</sup> By the shyning in his presence: the coles of fire were kindled.

<sup>14</sup> Our Lord wil thunder from heauen: and the high one wil geue his voice.

<sup>15</sup> He shot his arrowes and dispersed them: lightning, and consumed them.

<sup>16</sup> And the ouerflowings of the sea appeared, and the fundations of the world were discouered at the rebuking of our Lord, at the breathing of the spirit of his furie.

<sup>17</sup> He sent from hygh heauen, and tooke me, and drewe me out of manie waters.

<sup>18</sup> He deliuered me from my most mightie enemie, and from them that hated me: because they were stronger then I.

<sup>19</sup> He preuented me in the day of my affliction, and our Lord became my stay.

<sup>20</sup> And he brought me forth into latitude, he deliuered me, because I wel pleased him.

<sup>21</sup> Our Lord wil reward me according to my iustice: and according to the cleannes of my handes wil he render to me.

<sup>22</sup> Because I haue kept the wayes of our Lord, and haue not done impiously, from my God.

<sup>23</sup> For al his iudgementes are in my sight: and his preceptes I haue not remoued from me.

<sup>24</sup> And I shal be perfect with him: and shal keepe my self from myne iniquitie.

<sup>25</sup> And our Lord wil restore vnto me according to my iustice: and according to the cleannes of my handes in the sight of his eyes.

<sup>26</sup> With the holie one thou shalt be holie: and with the strong perfect.

<sup>27</sup> With the elect thou shalt be elect: and with the peruerse thou shalt be peruerted.

[^1]: ted, and his former remitted, acknowledging Gods infinite goodnes, by inspiration of the Holie Ghost, made this Canticle of thankfgeuing, and praise of God.

[^2]: It is inserted amongst the Psalmes: the 17. in order, almost in sense, so differing in some wordes that the one explicateth the other.
