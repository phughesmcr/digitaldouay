David.

OF KINGES.

thou wast he that didst leade vs forth and bring backe Israel: and our Lord sayd to thee: Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince ouer Israel. <sup>3</sup> The ancientes also of Israel came to the king into Hebron, and king Dauid made a league with them in Hebron before our Lord: and they an-nointed Dauid to be king ouer Israel. <sup>4</sup> Thirtie yeares old was Dauid when he began to reigne, and he reigned fourtie yea-res. <sup>5</sup> In Hebron he reigned ouer Iuda seuen yeares and six monethes: and in Ierusalem he reigned three and thirtie yea-res ouer al Israel & Iuda. <sup>6</sup> And the king went, & al the men that were with him, into Ierusalem to the Iebuseite the inha-biter of the land: & they said to Dauid: Thou shalt not come in hither, vnlesse thou take away the blind and the lame, saying: Dauid shal not come in hither. <sup>7</sup> But Dauid tooke the towre of Sion, this is the citie of Dauid. <sup>8</sup> For Dauid had proposed in that day a reward to whosoeuer should strike the Iebuseite, and touch the gutters of the house toppes, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the soule of Dauid: therefore it is sayd in the prouerbe: The blind and the lame shal not enter into the temple. <sup>9</sup> And Dauid dwelt in the towre, and called it, The citie of Dauid: & built round about from Mello and inwards. <sup>10</sup> And he went prospering and growing vp, and our Lord the God of hostes was with him. <sup>11</sup> Hiram also the king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid, and ceder trees, and carpenters, and masons for walles: and they built a house for Dauid. <sup>12</sup> And Dauid knew that our Lord had confirmed him king ouer Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdome ouer his people Israel. <sup>13</sup> Dauid therefore tooke yet concubines and wiues of Ierusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were borne to Dauid other sonnes also and daugh-ters: <sup>14</sup> And these be the names of them, that were borne to him in Ierusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Sa-lomon, <sup>15</sup> and Iebahar, and Elisua, and Nepheg, <sup>16</sup> and Iaphia, <sup>17</sup> and Elisama, and Elioda, and Eliphaleth. <sup>18</sup> The Philistijms therefore heard that they had annointed Dauid to be king ouer Israel: and they went vp al to seeke Dauid: which when Dauid had heard, he went downe into a hold. <sup>19</sup> And the Phi-listijms coming were spred in the Vale Raphaim. <sup>20</sup> And Dauid consulted our Lord, saying: Shal I goe vp to the Philistijms? and wilt thou geue them into my hand? And our Lord sayd to Dauid: Goe vp, because deliuering I wil geue the Philistijms
