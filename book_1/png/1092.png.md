thy lippes with iubilation. <sup>22</sup> They that hate thee, shal be clo-
thed with confusion: and the tabernacle of the impious
shal not stand.

CHAP. IX.

Iob approueth that no man auouching his owne iustice before God is iustified.
21. Testifieth that affliction of the innocent standeth wel with Gods iu-
stice, wisdom, and power.

[^1]AND Iob answering, said: <sup>2</sup> "In deede I know it is so, &
that man can not be iustified compared with God <sup>3</sup> If
he wil contend with him, he can not answer him one for a
thousand. <sup>4</sup> He is wise of hart, and strong of force: who
hath resisted him, & hath had peace? <sup>5</sup> He that transported
mountaynes, and they whom he subuerted in his furie, knew
not. <sup>6</sup> He that remoueth the earth out of her place, and the
pillers thereof are shaken. <sup>7</sup>He that commandeth the sunne, &
it riseth not: and shutteth vp the starres as it were vnder a
seale: <sup>8</sup> He that alone spreadeth the heauens, and goeth vpon
the waues of the sea. <sup>9</sup> He that maketh Arcturus, and Orion,
and Hyades, and the inner partes of the south. <sup>10</sup> He that
doth great thinges, and incomprehensible, and meruelous of
the which there is no number. <sup>11</sup> If he come to me, I shal not
see him: if he depart, I shal not vnderstand. <sup>12</sup> If sodenly he
aske, who shal answer him? or who can say: Why doest thou
so? <sup>13</sup> God whose wrath no man can resist, and vnder whom
they stoope that carie the world. <sup>14</sup> How great am I then,
that I may answer him, and speake with my wordes with him?
<sup>15</sup> Who although I haue anie iust thing, wil not answer, but
wil beseech my iudge. <sup>16</sup> And when he shal heare me inuoca-
ting, I doe not beleeue that he hath heard my voice. <sup>17</sup> For in
a hurlewinde shal he breake me, and shal multiplie my
woundes yea without cause. <sup>18</sup> He graunteth not my spirit to
rest, and he filleth me with bitternesse. <sup>19</sup> If strength be de-
maunded, he is most strong: if equitie of iudgement, not
man dare geue testimonie for me. <sup>20</sup> If I wil iustifie my self,
mine owne mouth shal condemne me, if I wil shew my self
innocent, he shal proue me wicked. <sup>21</sup> Although I shal be
simple, the self same shal my soul be ignorant of, and I shal
be wearie of my life. <sup>22</sup> One thing there is that I haue spo-
ken, both the innocent and the impious he consumeth. <sup>23</sup> If
he scourge, let him kil at once, and not laugh at the payn
