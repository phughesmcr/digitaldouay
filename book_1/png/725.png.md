OF KINGES. 705

Sacrifice is of the greatest. And therefore the maner of offering al sortes is at large prescribed in the Law, specially in the seuen first Chapters of Leviticus: The first and principal was Holocaust, wherin al the oblation was burned and consumed in the honour of God our Soueraigne Lord. The second was Sa- crifice for sinne, according to the diuersitie of offences and persons, wherof part was burned, the other part remained to the priestes, except it were for the sinnes of priestes, or of the whole multitude (Leuit. 4.) for then the priestes had no portion, but al was offered to God. The third was pacifique sacri- fice, either of thankesgeuing for benefites receiued, or to obtaine Gods fauour in al occurrent necessities, and good desires. And of both these sortes one part was consumed in Gods honour, an other part was the priestes, the third was theirs that gaue the oblation. In confirmation of these sacrifices God at first miraculously sent fire to burne them (Leuit. 9.) wherof he had geuen commandment before (Leuit. 6.) that it should be conserued, and neuer ex- tinguished, to teach vs specially of the new Testament, that haue the real Sacri- fice, and veritie beside of the former shadowes and figures, to nourish and keepe the fire of charitie, not procured by our owne power, but geuen by God, that it neuer cease, nor be extinguished in our hartes.

Likewise in the same law of Moyses, besides Circumcision instituted be- fore (Gen. 17.) and here confirmed and continued (Leuit. 12. Iosue. 5.) al ho- stes and sacrifices for sinne (Leuit. 4. 5. 6. and 7.) consecration of Priestes, (Leuit. 8.) and the sacrifices adioyned therevnto, also diuers other washings and purifications of legal vncleanes (Leuit. 14. 15. 16. and 17.) were al Sacraments; signifying either first iustification and re- mission of sinnes, or increase of grace, and puritie; of which sort it is also probable that the Paschal lambe, and Loaues of proposition were sa- craments (Exod. 12. 25.) Which multitudes, Augustin comparing with ours of the new Testament, sayth: The people bound with feare in the old law, was burdened with manie sacraments. For this was profitable to such men (saith he) to make them desire the grace, foretold by the prophetes, which being come from the wisdome of God becoming Man, by whom we are called into freedom, a few most wholsome Sacraments are instituted, which hold the societie of christian people vnder one God of a free multitude. But as Christes sacraments are fewer in number, so they are more excellent in vertue, and most of them now, the former do answere as figures and sha- dowes. So to our Baptisme answreth Circumcision, as S. Paul teacheth (Coloss. 1.) that Christians are circumcised in the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in Baptisme. To our holie Eucharist, as it is a Sacrament, did answere the Paschal lambe, & Loaues of proposition, as also Manna, and bloud of the Testament. It was prophecied Psal. 18. Adore his
