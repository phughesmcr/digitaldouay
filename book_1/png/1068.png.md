the empire of king Assuerus, it should be notified, the Iewes
to be readie to be reuenged of their enemies. <sup>14</sup> And there
went forth swift postes carying the massages, and the kinges
edict hong in Susan. <sup>15</sup> But Mardocheus going forth out of
the palace, and from the kinges presence, shining in royal
garmentes, to wit, hyacinthine and skie colour, bearing a
golden crowne on his head, and clothed with a silke and pur-
ple cloke. And the citie reioysed, and was glad. <sup>16</sup> But to the
Iewes there semed a new light to rise, ioye, honour, and
dauncing. <sup>17</sup> With al peoples, cities, and prouinces, whither
soeuer the kinges commandmentes came, meruelous reioysing,
feasting, and banketes, and holie day: in so much that

CHAP. IX.

*The Iewes kil their enemies which would haue killed them. 6. namely the
tenne sonnes of Aman are hanged on gallowes, 13. more slaine the next day.
17. the day folowing is made holie, and so to be kept euerie yeare.*

<sup>1</sup>THERFORE in the thirtenth day of the twelth moneth,
which we haue said now before to be called Adar, when
slaughter was prepared for al the Iewes, and their enemies
gaped after their bloud, "the case being changed to the con-
trarie, the Iewes began to be superious, and to reuenge
them selues of their aduersaries. <sup>2</sup> And they were gathered
together in euerie citie, and towne, and place, to extend
their hand against their enemies, and their persecutors. And
none durst resist, because the feare of their greatnes did pe-
netrate al peoples. <sup>3</sup> For both the iudges of the prouinces,
and captaynes, and lieutenantes, and euerie dignitie, that was
chiefe ouer euerie place and worke, extolled the Iewes for
feare of Mardocheus: <sup>4</sup> whom they knew to be prince of the
palace, and to be able to doe very much: the same also of his
name increased dayly, and flew abroad through al mens mou-
thes. <sup>5</sup> Therfore the Iewes stroke their enemies with a great
slaughter, and slew them, repaying them that which they had
prepared to doe to them: <sup>6</sup> in so much that in Susan also
they killed fiue hundred men, besides the tenne sonnes of
Aman the Agagite the enemie of the Iewes: whose names be
these: <sup>7</sup> Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha, <sup>8</sup> and
Phoratha,
