went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the arke, and they sounded with trumpettes. <sup>14</sup> And they went round about the citie the second day once, and returned into the campe. So did they six daies. <sup>15</sup> But the seuenth day, rysing vp early, they went about the citie, as it was ordained, seuen times. <sup>16</sup> And when in the seuenth going about the priestes sounded with the trumpettes, Iosue said to al Israel: Make a shoote: for our Lord hath deliuered to you the citie: <sup>17</sup> and let this citie be anathema: and al thinges that are in it, to our Lord. onlie Rahab the harlot let her liue, with al that be with her in the house: for she hidde the messengers whom we sent. <sup>18</sup> But you beware you touch not ought of those thinges, that are commanded, and be guiltie of preuarication, and al the campe of Israel be vnder sinne, and be trubled. <sup>19</sup> But whatsoeuer gold or siluer there shal be, and of brasen vessels and yron, let it be consecrated to our Lord, layd vp in his treasures. <sup>20</sup> Therfore al the people making a shoote, and the trumpettes sounding, after that the voice and the sound thundred in the eares of the multitude, the walles forthwith fel: and euerie man went vp by the place, that was against him: and they tooke the citie, <sup>21</sup> and killed al thinges that were in it, from man to woman, from the infant to the old man. The oxen also and sheepe, and the asses they stroke in the edge of the sword. <sup>22</sup> But to the two men that had bene sent for spies, Iosue said: Goe into the house of the woman the harlotte, and bring her forth, and al thinges that be hers, as you assured her by oath. <sup>23</sup> And the young men going in, brought out Rahab, and her parentes, her brethren also and al her stuffe and kinred, and made them to tarie without the campe. <sup>24</sup> But the citie, and al thinges, that were found therein they burnt; except the gold and siluer, and brasen vessels, and yron, which they consecrated vnto the treasurie of our Lord. <sup>25</sup> But Rahab the harlotte and the house of her father, and al that she had, Iosue caused to liue, and they dwelt in the middes of Israel vntil this present day: for that she hidde the messengers, which he had sent to view Iericho. At that time, Iosue pronounced a curse, saying: <sup>26</sup> Cursed be the man before our Lord, that shal rayse vp and build the citie of Iericho. In his first borne lay he the fundations therof, and in the last of his children sette he vp the gates therof. <sup>27</sup> Our Lord therefore was with Iosue, and his name was bruited in al the earth.
