thy visitation hath kept my spirit.<sup>13</sup> Although thou conceale these thinges in thy hart, yet I know that thou remembrest al thinges, <sup>14</sup> If I haue sinned and thou hast spared me for an houre: why doest thou not suffer me to be cleane from mine iniquitie? <sup>15</sup> And if I shal be impious, woe is to me: and if iust, I shal not lift vp my head, filled with affliction and miserie. <sup>16</sup> And for pride as a lionesse thou wilt take me, and returning thou doest meruelously torment me. <sup>17</sup> Thou renewest thy witnesses agaynst me, and multipliest thy wrath toward me, and paynes doe warre vpon me. <sup>18</sup> Why didst thou bring me forth out of the matrice? Who would God, I had beene consumed that eye might not see me. <sup>19</sup> I had beene as if I were not, caried from the wombe to the graue. <sup>20</sup> Shal not the fewnes of my daies be ended shortly? suffer me therfore, that I may a litle lament my sorow: <sup>21</sup> Before I goe, and returne not, vnto the darke land, that is couered with the mist of death: <sup>22</sup> A land of miserie and darkenesse, where is the shadow of death, and no order, but euerlasting horrour inhabiteth.

<aside>Repentance is alwayes ne-cessarie, but most especial-ly at the houre of death.</aside>
