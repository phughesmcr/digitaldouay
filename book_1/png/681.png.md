<sup>3</sup> And thou shalt goe in vnto the king, and shalt speake to him these maner of wordes. And Ioab put the wordes in her mouth. <sup>4</sup> Therefore when the woman of Thecua was gone in to the king, she fel before him vpon the ground, and adored and said: Saue me Ã´ king. <sup>5</sup> And the king sayd to her: What matter hast thou? Who answered: Alas, I am a widow woman: for my husband is dead. <sup>6</sup> And thy handmaide had two sonnes: who fel at wordes against eene other in the field, and there was none to stay them: and the one stroke the other, and slew him. <sup>7</sup> And behold the whole kinred rysing against thy handmaide, saith: Deliuer him that hath striken his brother that we may kil him for the life of his brother, whom he hath slayne, and may cleane destroy the heire: and they seeke to extinguish my sparkle, which is leift, that there may no name remaine to my husband, nor reliques vpon the earth. <sup>8</sup> And the king said to the woman: Goe into thy house, and I wil geue commandement for thee. <sup>9</sup> And the woman of Thecua said to the king: Vpon me, my lord, be the iniquitie; and vpon the house of my father: but be the king and his throne innocent. <sup>10</sup> And the king said: He that shal gaynesay thee bring him to me, & he shal adde no more to touch thee. <sup>11</sup> Who sayd: Let the king remember our Lord his God, that the next of bloud be not multiplied to reuenge, and that they kil not my sonne. Who sayd: Our Lord liueth, there shal not fal of the heares of thy sonne vpon the earth. <sup>12</sup> The woman therefore sayd: Let thy handmayde speake to my lord the king a word. <sup>13</sup> And he sayd: Speake. And the woman sayd: Why hast thou thought such a thing agaynst the people of God, and why hath the king spoken this word, that he would sinne, and not bring againe his banished one? <sup>14</sup> We doe al dye, and as waters that returne not, we fal downe on the earth: neither wil God haue a soule to perish, but reuoketh, meaning that he perish not altogether that is cast of. <sup>15</sup> Now therefore I come, that I may speake to my lord the king this word, the people being present. And thy handmayd sayd: I wil speake to the king, if by any meanes the king may doe the word of his handmaide. <sup>16</sup> And the king hath heard, to deliuer his handmaide out of the hand of al, that would destroy me out of the inheritance of our Lord, and my sonne together. <sup>17</sup> Let thy handmaide therefore say, that the word of my lord the king be made as a sacrifice. For euen as an Angel
