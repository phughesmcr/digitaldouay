Leuites in the middes of the possession of the children of Is- <sup>40</sup> rael were fourtie eight † with their suburbes, euerie one <sup>41</sup> distributed by the families. † And our Lord God gaue to Is- rael al the Land, that he had sworne he would geue to their [^1] <sup>42</sup> fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it. † And peace <sup>43</sup> was geuen by him to al nations round about: and none of their enemies durst resist them, but al were brought into their dominion. † Not so much certes as one word, which he had promised, that he would performe vnto them, was frustrate, but al thinges were accomplished in deedes.

CHAP. XXII.

*The tribes of Ruben and Gad, and half Manasses returne to their possessions. 10. Who building an altar by the side of Iordan, the other tribes suspect that they wil make a schisme, and therfore purpose to fight against them. 13. But first sending an ambassage to admonish them, 21. they answer, that they made not an altar, for sacrifice, but only for a monument, that not-withstanding they dwel on the other side of Iordan, yet they are of the same people of God, 30. wherwith al Israel is satisfied.*

<sup>1</sup> THE same time Iosue called the Rubenites, and Gadites, <sup>2</sup> and the halfe tribe of Manasses, † and said to them: You haue done al thinges that Moyses the seruant of our Lord comanded you: me also haue you obeyed in al thinges, <sup>3</sup> † neither haue you left your brethren a long time, vntil this present day, keeping the commandement of our Lord your <sup>4</sup> God. † Therfore because our Lord your God hath geuen your brethren quietnes and peace, as he promised: returne, and goe into your tabernacles, and to the land of your possession, which Moyses the seruant of our Lord deliuered to <sup>5</sup> you beyond Iordan: † :: alwayes so that you keepe atten- tiuely, and in worke fulfil the commandement, and the law which Moyses the seruant of our Lord commanded you, that you loue our Lord your God, and walke in al his wayes, and obserue al his commandementes, & cleaue to him, and serue <sup>6</sup> him in al your hart, and in al your soule. † And Iosue :: blessed them, and dismissed them. Who returned into their taber- <sup>7</sup> nacles. † And to the halfe tribe of Manasses Moyses had ge- uen possession in Basan: and therefore to the halfe that re- mayned, Iosue gaue a lotte among the rest of their brethren beyond Iordan at the West side. And when he dismissed them <sup>8</sup> into their tabernacles, & had blessed them, † he said to them:

[^1]: God gaue al the Land in due time, but not al at once, for the causes expressed Exo. 23. v. 29. Deut. 7. v. 22.
