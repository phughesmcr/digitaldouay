And their handes were incouraged in good. <sup>19</sup> But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the seruant an Ammanite, and Goseman Arabian heard of it, and they scorned vs, and despysed vs, and sayd: What is this thing, that you doe? Why do you rebel against the king? <sup>20</sup> And I answered them, and sayd to them: The God of heauen he helpeth vs, and we are his seruants: let vs rise and build: but you haue no part, nor iustice, nor memorie in Ierusalem.
