The same is Ezechias, that stopped the vpper fountaine of the waters of Gihon, and turned them away vnderneth toward the West of the Citie of Dauid: in al his workes he did prosperously <sup>31</sup> what he would. But yet in the embassie of the princes of Babylon, that were sent to him, to aske of the wonder, that had chanced vpon the earth, God left him that he might be tempted, and al thinges might be made knowen, that were in <sup>32</sup> his hart. But the rest of the wordes of Ezechias, and of his mercies are writen in the vision of Isaias the sonne of Amos the prophete, and in the booke of the kinges of Iuda & Israel. <sup>33</sup> And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefe sepulchres of the children of Dauid: and al Iuda celebrated his funeralles, & al the inhabitantes of Ierusalem: and Manasses his sonne reigned for him.

And he built them to al the host of heauen in the two courtes of the house of our Lord. <sup>6</sup> And he made his sonnes to passe through fyre, in the Vale-benennom: he obserued dreames, folowed soothsayings, gaue him self to magike artes, he had with him magicians, & inchanters: and he wrought manie euils before our Lord, to <sup>7</sup> prouoke him. Also a grauen, and a molten signe he put in the house of God, wherof our Lord spake to Dauid, and to Salomon his sonne, saying: In this house, and in Ierusalem, which I haue chosen al the tribes of Israel, wil I put my name
