<sup>1</sup>the mountaynes: or what, and of what sorte, and how great their cities are: also what their power is, or what is their multitude: or who is the king of their warfare: <sup>4</sup>and why aboue al that dwel in the East, haue these contemned vs, and haue not come forth to meete vs, that they might receiue vs with peace? <sup>5</sup>Then Achior captaine of al the children of Ammon answering, said: If thou voutchsafe my Lord to heare, I wil tel the truth in thy sight of this people, which dwelleth in the mountaynes, and there shal not a false word come forth of my mouth. <sup>6</sup>This people is of the progenie of the Chaldees. <sup>7</sup>The same dwelt first in Mesopotamia, because they would not folow the goddes of their fathers, which were in the land of the Chaldees. <sup>8</sup>Forsaking therfore the ceremonies of their fathers, which were in multitude of goddes, <sup>9</sup>they worshipped one God of heauen, who also commanded them that they should depart from thence, and should dwel in Charan. And when there was famine ouer al the land, they went downe into Ægypt, and there for foure hundred yeares were so multiplied, that the host of them could not be numbred. <sup>10</sup>And when the king of Ægypt oppressed them, and in the buildinges of his cities had subdewed them in brick and claye, they cried to their Lord, and he stroke the whole Land of Ægypt with diuers plagues. <sup>11</sup>And when the Ægyptians had cast them out from them, and the plague had ceased from them, and they would take them againe, and cal them backe to their seruice, <sup>12</sup>these fleeing away, the God of heauen opened the sea, so that the waters were consolidated as a wal, on either side, and they walking through the botome of the sea passed drie foote. <sup>13</sup>In which place whiles an innumerable armie of the Ægyptians pursewed them, they were so ouerwhelmed with the waters, that there was not one remayning, to tel the fact to posteritie. <sup>14</sup>Also being past the read sea, they possessed the desertes of Mount Sinai, in which neuer man could dwel, or sonne of man rested. <sup>15</sup>There bitter fountaynes were made sweete for them to drinke, and for fourtie yeares they receiued meate from heauen. <sup>16</sup>Wheresoeuer they entered without bow and arrow, and without shielde and sword, their God fought for them, and ouercame. <sup>17</sup>And there was not that did insult against this people, but when they departed from the worship of the Lord their God. <sup>18</sup>But as often as beside
