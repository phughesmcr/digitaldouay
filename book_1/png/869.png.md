geuen a place to my people Israel: it shal be planted, and shal dwel therin, and shal be moued no more, neither shal the children of iniquitie consume them, as from the beginning, <sup>10</sup> since the dayes that I gaue iudges to my people Israel, and haue humbled al thine enimies. I therfore tel thee, that our Lord wil build thee a house. <sup>11</sup> And when thou shalt haue accomplished thy daies to goe to thy fathers, I wil rayse vp thy seede after thee, which shalbe of thy children: and I wil establish his kingdom. <sup>12</sup> He shal build me a house, and I wil confirme his throne for euer. <sup>13</sup> I wil be to him for a father, and he shal be to me for a sonne: and my mercie I wil not take from him, as I tooke from him, that was before thee. <sup>14</sup> And I wil establish him in my house, and in my kingdom for euer: and his throne shalbe most firme for euer. <sup>15</sup> According to al these wordes, and according to al this vision, so spake Nathan to Dauid. <sup>16</sup> And when king Dauid came, and sate before our Lord, he sayd: Who am I Lord God, and what is my house, <sup>17</sup> that thou shouldest geue me such thinges? But this also hath semed little in thy sight, and therfore thou hast spoken concerning the house of thy seruant for time to come also: and hast made me renowned aboue al men Lord God. <sup>18</sup> What can Dauid adde farther, wheras thou hast soe glorified thy seruant, and knowen him? <sup>19</sup> Lord for thy seruant according to thy hart thou hast done al this magnificence, and would haue al thy great wonders to be knowen. <sup>20</sup> Lord, there is not the like to thee: and there is none other beside thee, of al whom we haue heard with our eares. <sup>21</sup> For what other is there, as thy people Israel, one nation in the earth, to the which God went, to deliuer it and make it his people, and with his greatenesse and terrours cast out the nations before the face of it, which he deliuered out of Ã†gypt? <sup>22</sup> And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy people euer, <sup>23</sup> and thou Lord art made the God therof. Now therfore Lord, the word, which thou hast spoken to thy seruant, and concerning his house, be it confirmed for euer, and do as thou hast spoken. <sup>24</sup> And let thy name remayne and be magnified for euer: and let it be sayd: The Lord of hostes is God of Israel, and the house of Dauid his seruant permanent before <sup>25</sup> him. For thou Lord my God hast reueled the eare of thy seruant, to build him a house: and therfore thy seruant hath <sup>26</sup> found confidence, to pray before thee. Now therfore

<aside>That is con-tinued, and preserue thy seede, and fa-milie as we see it performed euen to the B. virgin Marie, and Christ of the house of Dauid. Ier. 23.</aside>
