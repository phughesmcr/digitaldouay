the riuer, which runneth downe to Ahaua, and we taried
there three daies: and I sought among the people and among
the Priestes for the children of Leui, and found none there.
<sup>16</sup> Therfore I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elna-
than, and Iarib, and other Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacha-
rias, and Mosollam princes: and Ioiarib, and Elnathan wise
<sup>17</sup> men. And I sent them to Eddo, which is chiefe in the place
of Chasphia, and I did put in theyr mouth the wordes that
they should speake to Eddo, and his brethren the Nathine-
ites in the place of Chasphia, that they should bring vs mi-
<sup>18</sup> nisters of the house of our God. And they brought vs by
the good hand of our God vpon vs a most learned man of the
children of Moholi the sonne of Leui the sonne of Israel,
<sup>19</sup> and Sarabias and his sonnes, and his brethren eightene, and
<sup>20</sup> Hasabias, and with him Isaias of the children of Merari, and
his brethren, and his sonnes twentie. And al the Nathine-
ites, which Dauid gaue, and the princes for the ministeries
of the Leuites, Nathineites two hundred twentie: al these
<sup>21</sup> were called by theyr names. And I proclaymed there a fast
beside the Riuer of Ahaua, that we might be afflicted before
the Lord our God, and might desire of him a right way for
<sup>22</sup> vs and our children, and al our substance. For I was asha-
med to aske the king ayde and horsemen, that might defend
vs from the enemie in the way: because we had sayd to the
king: The hand of our God is vpon al them, that seeke him
in goodnesse: and his empire and strength, and furie vpon al
<sup>23</sup> them that forsake him. And we fasted, and besought our
<sup>24</sup> God hereby: and it fel out prosperously vnto vs. And I
separated twelue of the chief Priestes, Sarabias, and Hasabias,
<sup>25</sup> and with them ten of theyr brethren. And I weyed vnto
them the siluer and gold, and the consecrated vessels of the
house of our God, which the king had offered and his coun-
<sup>26</sup> selers, and his princes, and al Israel of them, that were found:
and I weyed in theyr handes of siluer six hundred fiftie
talentes, and vessels of siluer an hundred, of gold an hundred
<sup>27</sup> talentes: and cuppes of gold twentie, which had a thou-
sand solides, and two vessels of the best shyning brasse, fayre,
<sup>28</sup> as gold. And I sayd to them: You are the holie of our Lord,
and the vessels are holie, and the siluer and gold, that is volun-
<sup>29</sup> tarely offered to our Lord the God of our fathers: Watch
& keepe it, vntil you deliuer it by weight before the princes
