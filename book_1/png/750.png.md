And he had wiues as it were queenes seuen hundred, and concubines three hundred: and the women turned away his hart. <sup>4</sup>And when he was now old, his hart was depraued by women, that he folowed strange goddes: neither was his hart perfect with our Lord his God, as the hart of Dauid his father. <sup>5</sup>But Salomon worshipped Astarthe the goddesse of the Sidonians, and Moloch the idol of the Ammonites. <sup>6</sup>And Salomon did that which was not liked before our Lord, and he accomplished not to folow our Lord, as Dauid his father. <sup>7</sup>Then built Salomon a temple to Camos the idol of Moab, in the mount that is agaynst Ierusalem, and to Moloch the idol of the children of Ammon. <sup>8</sup>And in this maner did he to al his wiues that were strangers, which burnt frankencense, and immolated to their goddes. <sup>9</sup>Therfore our Lord was wrath with Salomon, because his minde was turned away from our Lord the God of Israel, who had appeared vnto him the second tyme, <sup>10</sup>and had commanded him concerning this word, that he should not folow strange goddes, & he kept not the thinges which our Lord commanded him. <sup>11</sup>Our Lord therfore sayd to Salomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my couenant, and my preceptes, which I haue commanded thee, breaking I wil rent asunder thy kingdom, and wil geue it to thy seruant. <sup>12</sup>Neuerthelesse in thy dayes I wil not doe it, because of Dauid thy father: out of the hand of thy sonne I wil rent it, <sup>13</sup>neither wil I take away the whole kingdom, but one tribe I wil geue to thy sonne for Dauid my seruant, and Ierusalem, which I haue chosen. <sup>14</sup>And our Lord raysed vp an aduersarie to Salomon, Adad an Idumeite of the kinges seede, who was in Edom. <sup>15</sup>For when Dauid was in Idumea, and Ioab the general of the warfare was gone vp to burie them that were slayne, and had slayne al malekind in Idumea, <sup>16</sup>(for Ioab taried there six monethes and al Israel, til he slew al malekind in Idumea,) <sup>17</sup>Adad him self fled, and men of Idumea of his fathers seruantes with him, to goe into Ægypt: and Adad was a litle boy. <sup>18</sup>And when they rose out of Madian, they came into Pharan, and they tooke with them men of Pharan, and entered into Ægypt to Pharao the king of Ægypt: who gaue him a house, and appoynted him meates, and
