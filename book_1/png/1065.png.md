But Aman thinking in his hart, and supposing that the king would honour no other, but him self, <sup>7</sup> answered: The man, whom the king desireth to honour, <sup>8</sup> ought to be clothed with the kings garmentes, and to be set vpon the horse, that is for the kings saddle, and to take the kings crowne vpon his head, <sup>9</sup> and let the chiefe of the kings princes and nobles hold his horse, and going throuh the streat of the citie, crie, and say: So shal he be honoured, whomsoever the king wil honour. <sup>10</sup> And the king said to him: Make hast, and taking a robe and a horse, do that thou hast spoken, to Mardocheus the Iewe, which sitteth before the doores of the palace: Beware thou pretermitte nothing of those things, which thou hast spoken. <sup>11</sup> Aman therfore tooke a robe and a horse, and putting it on Mardocheus, and setting him on the horse, in the streat of the citie went before him, and cried: This honour is he worthie of, whom soever the king is willing to honour. <sup>12</sup> And Mardocheus returned to the palace gate: and Aman made hast to goe into his house, mourning and his head couered: <sup>13</sup> and he told Zares his wife, and his frendes al things, that had chaunced him. To whom the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered: If Mardocheus be of the Iewes seede, before whom thou hast begune to fal, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fal in his sight. <sup>14</sup> As they were yet speaking, the kings eunuches came, and compelled him to goe quickly to the banket, which the queene had prepared.
