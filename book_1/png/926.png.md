<sup>11</sup> And they brought forth the kings sonne, and put the crowne vpon him, and the testimonie, and gaue the law to be in his hand, & they made him king: Ioiada also the high Priest, and his sonnes annoynted him: and they wished him wel, and said: God saue the king. <sup>12</sup> Which thing when Athalia had heard, to witte, the voice of them that ranne and praysed the king, she went in vnto the people, into the temple of our Lord. <sup>13</sup> And when she had seene the king standing vpon the steppe in the entrance, and the princes, and the companies about him, and al the people of the land reioycing, and sounding with trumpettes, and playing on instrumentes of diuerse kind, and the voice of them that praysed, she rent her garmentes, and sayd: Treason, treason. <sup>14</sup> And Ioiada the high Priest going forth to the centurions, and captaines of the armie, sayd to them: Bring her forth without the precinct of the temple, and let her be killed with the sword without. And the Priest commanded that she should not be killed in the house of our Lord. <sup>15</sup> And they layd handes vpon her necke: and when she was entred within the gate of the horses of the kinges house, they killed her there. <sup>16</sup> And Ioiada made a couenant between himself, and al the people, and the king, that they would be the people of our Lord. <sup>17</sup> Al the people therfore entred into the house of Baal, and destroyed it: and they brake his altars and his images: Mathan also the priest of Baal they slewe before the altars. <sup>18</sup> And Ioiada appoynted ouerseers in the house of our Lord, vnder the handes of the Priestes, & the Leuites, which Dauid distributed in the house of our Lord: that they should offer holocaustes to our Lord, as it is writen in the law of Moyses, in ioy and songes, according to the disposition of Dauid. <sup>19</sup> He appoynted also porters in the gates of the house of our Lord, that the vncleane in anie thing should not enter in. <sup>20</sup> And he tooke the centurions, and the most valiant men and princes of the people, and al the common people of the land, and they made the king to goe downe from the house of our Lord, & to enter by the middes of the vpper gate into the kinges house, and placed him in the royal throne. <sup>21</sup> And al the people of the land reioysed, & the citie was quiet: moreouer Athalia was slayne with the sword.
