<sup>15</sup> to the king of Ammon: Thus sayth Iephte: Israel did not take the Land of Moab, nor the Land of the children of Ammon: <sup>16</sup> but when they ascended out of Ã†gypt, he walked through the desert vnto the Readsea, and came into Cades. <sup>17</sup> And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me that I may passe through thy land. Who would not condescend to his requestes. He sent also to the king of Moab, who also him selfe contemned to geue passage. He abode therfore in Cades, <sup>18</sup> and compassed the Land of Edom at the side, and the land of Moab: and came against the East quarter of the Land of Moab, and camped beyond Arnon: neither would he enter the boundes of Moab: for Arnon is the border of the Land of Moab. <sup>19</sup> Israel therfore sent messengers to Sehon the king of the Amorrheites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to passe through thy land vnto the riuer. <sup>20</sup> Who also him selfe despising the wordes of Israel, suffered him not to passe through his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude went forth against him into Iasa, and resisted strongly. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord deliuered him into the handes of Israel with al his armie, and he stroke him, and possessed al the Land of the Amorrheite the inhabiter of that countrie: <sup>22</sup> and al the coastes therof from Arnon vnto Iaboc, & from the wildernes vnto Iordan. <sup>23</sup> Our Lord therfore the God of Israel subuerted the Amorrheite, his people of Israel fighting against him, and wilt thou now possesse his land? <sup>24</sup> Are not those thinges which Chamos thy God possessed, dew to thee by right?

Wherfore haue you so long attempted nothing for reclaime? <sup>27</sup> Therfore I doe not sinne against thee, but thou doest euil against me, denouncing me vniust warres. Our Lord be iudge the arbiter of this day betwen Israel, and betwen the children of Ammon. <sup>28</sup> And the king of the children of Ammon would not harken to the wordes of Iephte, which he sent him by the messengers. <sup>29</sup> Therfore the spirite of our Lord came vpon Iephte, and circuiting Galaad, and Manasses,
