<sup>1</sup> AND our Lord said to Iosue: Feare not, neither doe
thou dread: take with thee al the multitude of fighting
men, and rysing goe vp vnto the towne of Hai. behold I
haue deliuered into thy hand the King therof, & the people,
<sup>2</sup> and the citie and the land. And thou shalt do to the citie
of Hai, and to the King therof, as thou hast done to Iericho,
and to the King therof: but the praye and al the cattel you
shal spoyle for your selues: lay ambushmentes to the citie
<sup>3</sup> behind it. And Iosue arose, and al the hoste of the men of
warre with him, to goe vp into Hai: and thirtie thousand
<sup>4</sup> chosen valiant men he sent in the night, and commanded
them, saying: Lay ambushmentes behinde the citie: neither

contrarie side against the citie. And when they shal issue out
against vs, as we did before, we wil flee, and turne our

<sup>7</sup> the citie: for they wil thinck that we flee as before. We

ambushmentes, and shal waist the citie: and our Lord your
<sup>8</sup> God wil deliuer it into your handes. And when you shal
take it, burne it, and you shal doe al thinges so, as I haue
<sup>9</sup> commanded. And he dismissed them away, and they went
on to the place of the ambushment, and sate betwen Bethel
and Hai, at the West side of the citie of Hai. But Iosue that
<sup>10</sup> night stayed in the middes of the people, and rysing early
he mustered his souldiers, and went vp with the ancientes in
the fronte of the hoste, enuironed with the ayde of the fight-
<sup>11</sup> ing men. And when they were come, and were gone vp
directly against the citie, they stoode on the North side of the
citie, betwen which and them was a valley in the middes.
