spoken: and rising vp went into Silo, and came into the house
of Ahias: but he could not see, because his eies were dimme
for age. <sup>4</sup> And our Lord sayd to Ahias: Behold the wife of
Ieroboam cometh in, to consult thee concerning her sonne
that is sicke: thus and thus shalt thou speake to her. When
she therfore entered in, and dissembled to be that she was,
<sup>5</sup> Ahias heard the sound of her feete entring in at the doore,
and sayd: Come in Ieroboams wife: Why doest thou fayne
thy self to be an other woman? But I am sent to thee a heauie
messenger. <sup>6</sup> Goe, and tel Ieroboam: Thus sayth our Lord
the God of Israel: Because I haue exalted thee out of the
middes of the people, and made thee prince ouer my people
Israel: <sup>7</sup> and haue rent the kingdom of the house of Dauid,
and geuen it to thee, and thou hast not beene as my seruant
Dauid, who kept my commandementes, and folowed me in
al his hart, doing that which was wel liked in my sight: <sup>8</sup> but
hast wrought euil aboue al, that haue beene before thee, and
hast made thee strange and molten goddes, that thou migh-
test prouoke me to anger, and hast reiected me behind thy
backe: <sup>9</sup> therfore behold I wil bring in euils vpon the house
of Ieroboam, and wil strike of Ieroboam him that pisseth to
the wal, and the inclosed, and the vilest in Israel: and I wil
cleanse the remaynes of the house of Ieroboam, as dung is
wont to be cleansed til al be pure. <sup>10</sup> They that shal die of
Ieroboam in the citie, them the dogges shal eate: and they that
shal die in the field, them the foules of the ayre shal deuoure:
because our Lord hath spoken. <sup>11</sup> Thou therefore arise, and
goe into thy house: and in the verie entrance of thy feete
into the citie, the childe shal die, <sup>12</sup> and al Israel shal mourne
for him, and shal burie him: for this onlie of Ieroboam shal
be brought into the sepulchre, because vpon him hath beene
found a good word from our Lord the God of Israel, in the
house of Ieroboam. <sup>13</sup> And our Lord wil appoynt to him self
a king ouer Israel, that shal strike the house of Ieroboam in
this day, and in this time: <sup>14</sup> and our Lord the God of Israel shal
strike it, as a reede is wont to be moued in the water: and he
shal plucke out Israel from this good countrie, which he gaue
to their fathers, and shal scatter them ouer the Riuer: because
they haue made to them selues groues, to prouoke our Lord.
<sup>15</sup> And our Lord shal deliuer Israel for the sinnes of Ieroboam,
<sup>16</sup> who hath sinned, & made Israel to sinne. <sup>17</sup> The wife therefore
of Ieroboam

<aside>Ieroboam did not wittingly and of purpose set vp false goddes, to the end he might prouoke God to anger: for his intention only was to kepe the people fr≈ç going to Ierusalem, lest by that occasion they should returne to Roboam their lord, king of Iuda. ch. 12. v. 27. But by setting vp idols he did prouoke God con sequently to anger. So here and in other places this phrase: that he might prouoke:</aside>
