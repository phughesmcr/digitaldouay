moued excedingly he scorned the Iewes. †<sup>2</sup>and sayd before his 
bretheren, and the multitude of the Samaritanes: What doe 
the sillie Iewes? Wil the gentiles let them alone? Shal they 
sacrifice and accomplish in one day? Why, are they able to 
build vp the stones out of the heapes of dust, that are burnt? 
†<sup>3</sup>Yea Tobias also the Ammanite his neighbour sayd: Let 
them build: if a fox come vp, he shal leape ouer their stone 
wal. †<sup>4</sup>Heare our God, because we are had in dispise: turne 
the reproch vpon their head, and giue them into dispite in a 
Land of captiuitie. †<sup>5</sup>Couer not their iniquitie, and let not 
their sinne be put out before thy face, because they haue 
mocked thy builders. †<sup>6</sup>Therfore we built the wal, and ioyned 
together the whole vnto the halfe part: and the hart of the 
people was prouoked to worke. †<sup>7</sup>And it came to passe, when 
Sanaballat had heard, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the 
Ammanites, and the Azotians, that the breach of the wal 
of Ierusalem was closed vp, and the gates began to be stop-
ped, they were wrath excedingly. †<sup>8</sup>And they were al assem-
bled together, to come, and to fight against Ierusalem, and 
to prepare embushments. †<sup>9</sup>And we prayed our God, and set 
watchmen vpon the wal day and night against them. †<sup>10</sup>And 
Iudas sayd: The strength of him that carrieth is weakened, & 
the morter is very much, and we shal not be able to build the 
wal. †<sup>11</sup>And our enimies sayd: Let them not know, and let 
them be ignorant, til we come into the midst of them, and 
kil them, and make their worke to cease. †<sup>12</sup>And it came to 
passe, the Iewes that dwelt beside them, coming and telling 
vs ten times, out of al places from whence they came to vs, 
†<sup>13</sup>I sette the people in a place behind the wal round about in 
order, with their swordes, and speares, and bowes. †<sup>14</sup>And 
I looked and rose vp: & I sayd to the princes and magistrates, 
and to the rest of the common people: Be not afrayd at their 
face: Remember our Lord great and terrible, and fight for 
your bretheren, your sonnes, and your daughters, and your 
wiues, and your houses. †<sup>15</sup>And it came to passe, when our 
enimies had heard that it was told vs, God defeated their 
counsel. And we returned al to the walles, euery man to his 
worke. †<sup>16</sup>And it came to passe from that day, the halfe part 
of their yongmen did the worke, and halfe was ready to 
battel, and speares, & sheilds, and bowes, and cotes of mayle,
