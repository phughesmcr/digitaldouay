A Canticle of the law. DEVTERONOMIE. 461

<sup>21</sup> from me, and make my couenant of none effect. After that manie euils and afflictions shal haue found them, this canticle shal answer them for a testimonie, which no obliuion shal take away out of the mouth of their seede. For I know their cogitations, what thinges they are about to doe this day, before that I bring them into the Land, which I <sup>22</sup> haue promised them. Moyses therfore wrote the canticle, <sup>23</sup> and taught it the children of Israel. And our Lord commanded Iosue the sonne of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the Land, which I haue promised, and I wil be with thee. <sup>24</sup> Therfore after that Moyses wrote the wordes of this law in a vo- <sup>25</sup> lume, and finished it: he commanded the Leuites, that <sup>26</sup> caried the arke of the couenant of our Lord, saying: Take this booke, and put it in the side of the arke of the couenant of our Lord your God: that it may be for a testimonie against <sup>27</sup> thee. For I know thy contention, and thy most stiffe necke. Whiles I yet liue and goe in with you, you haue done alwayes contenciously against our Lord: how much more <sup>28</sup> when I shal be dead? Gather to me al the ancientes by your tribes, and your doctors, and I wil speake these wordes in their hearing, and wil inuocate against them heauen and <sup>29</sup> earth. For I know that after my death you wil doe wickedly, and wil decline quickly from the way, that I haue commanded you: and euils shal come vpon you in the later times, when you shal doe euil in the sight of our Lord, to <sup>30</sup> prouoke him by the workes of your handes. Moyses therfore spake, in the hearing of the whole assemblie of Israel, the wordes of this song, and finished it euen to the end.
