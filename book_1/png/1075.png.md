# Esther

<sup>11</sup> O Lord, Lord, king Almighty, for all things are in thy power, and there is none that can resist thy will, if thou determine to save Israel. <sup>12</sup> Thou hast made heaven and earth, and all things that are under the cope of heaven. <sup>13</sup> Thou art Lord of all, and there is none that can resist thy majesty. <sup>14</sup> Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest that it was not for pride and contempt, or any desire of glory, that I did not adore the proud Aman, <sup>15</sup> (For I would willingly and readily for the salvation of Israel have kissed even the steps of his feet,) <sup>16</sup> But I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any one except my God. <sup>17</sup> And now, O Lord king, O God of Abraham, have mercy on thy people, because our enemies resolve to destroy us, and extinguish thy inheritance. <sup>18</sup> Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed for thyself out of Egypt. <sup>19</sup> Hear my supplication, and be merciful to thy lot and inheritance, and turn our mourning into joy, that we may live and praise thy name, O Lord, and shut not the mouths of them that sing to thee. <sup>20</sup> And all Israel with like mind and supplication cried to the Lord, because they saw certain death hanging over them.

<sup>1</sup> Esther also the queen fled to the Lord, fearing the danger that was at hand. <sup>2</sup> And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments suitable for weeping and mourning: instead of divers precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her body with fasts: and all the places in which before she was accustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair. <sup>3</sup> And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying: My Lord, who alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other helper but thee. <sup>4</sup> My danger is in my hands. <sup>5</sup> I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to possess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them as thou hast promised. <sup>6</sup> We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies: <sup>7</sup> For we have worshipped their gods. Thou art just, O Lord. <sup>8</sup> And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard bondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of their idols, <sup>9</sup> They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance, and shut the mouths
