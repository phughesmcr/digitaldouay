Ierusalem a rebellious and naughtie citie, which they build making the rampyres thereof, and repayring the walles.

<sup>13</sup> Now therfore be it knowen to the king, that if that citie shal be built, and the walles therof repayred, they will not geue tributes, and tolles, & yearly rentes, and this damage wil come euen to the kinges. <sup>14</sup> But we mindful of the salt that we haue eaten in the palace, and because we count it heynous to see the kings harmes, therfore we haue sent and certified the king, <sup>15</sup> that thou recount in the bookes of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt finde writen in the commenta-ries: and shalt know that that citie is a rebellious citie, and hurtful to the kinges, and prouinces, and battels are raysed in it of old time: for the which cause also the citie it selfe was destroyed. <sup>16</sup> We certifie the king, that if that citie shal be built, and the walles therof repayred, thou shalt haue no possession beyond the Riuer. <sup>17</sup> The king sent word to Reum Beelteem, and Samsai scribe, and to the rest that were in their counsel inhabitantes of Samaria, and to the rest beyond the Riuer, sending greeting and peace. <sup>18</sup> The accusation, which you haue sent to vs, was openly read before me. <sup>19</sup> and I gaue commandment: and they recounted, and haue found, that that citie of old time rebelleth agaynst the kinges, and seditions and battels are raysed in it. <sup>20</sup> For there haue beene also most valiant kinges in Ierusalem, which also had dominion ouer al the countrie, that is beyond the Riuer. They tooke also tribute, and tolle, and rentes. <sup>21</sup> Now therefore heare the sentence: Prohibite ye those men, that that citie be not built, til it perhaps shal be commanded by me. <sup>22</sup> See that you doe not negligently accomplish this thing; and by litle there grow euil agaynst the kinges. <sup>23</sup> Therfore the copie of the edict of Artaxerxes the king was read before Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe, and their counselers: and they went in hast into Ierusalem to the Iewes, & prohibited them with arme and strength. <sup>24</sup> Then was the worke of the house of our Lord in Ierusalem intermitted, and was not done vntil the second yeare of the reigne of Darius the king of the Persians.
