# THE SECOND PART OF THE OLD TESTAMENT: CONTEINING HISTORICAL BOOKES.

The argument of the booke of Iosue.

<hr>

WHETHER Iosue himself writ this booke (which is the common opinion) or some other, it was euer held vndoubtedly by al, for Canonical Scripture: and according to the distribution of the whole Bible into Legal, Historical, Sapiential, and Prophetical Bookes, this is the first of the historical sorte. But as the fiue precedent called Legal, besides the Law, comprehend also the historie of the Church, from the beginning of the world aboue 2500. yeares, and withal conteine much diuine Wisdome, & Prediction of thinges to come: so these bookes now folowing called Historical, and likewise the Sapiential and Prophetical ensuing after, participate ech with others in their seueral argumentes: euerie one more or lesse inducing Gods seruantes to keepe his Law; recording thinges donne; teaching what is most meete to be donne; and foreshewing before hand, thinges donne afterwards, or which yet shal come to passe. So this booke doth not only set forth the external gouernment of Gods people, commanding and directing them by lawes and wisdome; but also the same thinges donne by him, and his verie name (as S. Hierom, & other Fathers teach) prefigure our Lord IESVS Christ. For in Hebrew IEHOSVA is the name both of this Capitaine General, the leader of The Israelites ouer Iordan into the Land of promise, and of our Lord and SAVIOVR, who by his Baptisme, and other Sacramentes bringeth his people of al Nations, into the true Land of the liuing, where is life and felicitie euerlasting. Touching therfore the historie, these foure special thinges are here described. First, the passage of the Israelites ouer Iordan. In the fiue first chapters. Secondly, their conquest of the promised Land. In the seuen chapters folowing. Thirdly, the partition of the same Land amongst nine Tribes and a half: from the. 13. chap. to the 22. Fourthly, in the three last chapters, the returne of the other two Tribes and a half to their possessions, on the east side of Iordan; with Iosues last admonition to them al, to serue God sincerly; and his, and Eleazars death.
