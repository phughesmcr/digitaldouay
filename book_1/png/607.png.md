Samuel here by Gods appointment, to disswade Kinges some-
times oppose
their subiectes
by Gods suffe-
rance, but vn-
iustly.

the people from their desire of a king, at least to admonish them before hand,
what they are like to find by experience, reciteth such thinges, as Kinges abu-
sing their powre do oftentimes practise, by reason of their high dignitie, and
litle feare of controlment, but vniustly and vnlawfully: according to the do-
ctrin of ancient Fathers. Amongst others. S. Cyprian calleth the exactions of
kinges here recited, *querelæ immodicæ*. S. Hierom *dura imperia, & seruitutes*. *tyran-
nical and gouernment, and seruitude*. S. Gregorie proueth the same by two
contrarie examples. Seing (sayeth he) that which is here foretold, was pu-
nished in Achab and Iezabel (<sup>3</sup>*Reg. 21.*) it sheweth, that it was not right by
diuine iudgement, which they exacted. And when the elect King Dauid was to
build an altar to our Lord (<sup>1</sup>*Paral. 21.*) he would not take part of Ornans field,
except he payed a iust price for it. Moreouer the law prescribing the dutie of
Kinges (*Deut. 17. v. 16. &c.*) commandeth them not to multiplie horses, nor
*to heape riches*, nor to *take high courage, that their hartes be not lifted vp into pride ouer
their brethren*. Neuertheles Kinges haue great prerogatiues (more then Dukes,
and Iudges) besides, and aboue, but neuer contrarie to the lawe; that albeit
they can not take their subiectes landes or goodes, neither for themselues,
nor to geue to their seruantes at their pleasure: yet in diuers cases subiectes
are bound, to contribute of their priuate goodes, to supplie the necessitie of the
King, or of the commonwealth, as by nature euerie part must suffer da-
mage, or danger in defence of the principal member, or whole bodie: And if
anie refuse so to do, they may iustly be compelled.

Furthermore in case Kinges or other Princes commit excesses, and oppress
their subiectes, yet are they not by and by to be deposed by the people, nor
commonwealth, but must be tolerated with patience, peace, and meeknes, til
God by his soueraigne authoritie, left in his Church, dispose of them: which
his diuine wisdom and prouidence differreth to do, as here he expressly fore-
warneth saying: (<sup>v. 18.</sup>) *You shal crie in that day, from the face of your King, and
our Lord wil not heare you*. And the reason is, because he wil punish the sinnes
of the people, by suffering euil princes to reigne. *Iob. 34. v. 30.*

Of which important difficultie, falling sometimes betwen Princes and their
subiectes, who so desireth, may read the iudgement of ancient Fathers, and
see S. Thomas, and other Schole Doctors, *2. 2. q. 12. a. 2.* Here only for better
vnderstanding of this pre-enttext, these brief pointes may be obserued. First,
the people of their owne wil desired to haue a King. Secondly, they requested
the same at the handes of Samuel their present Superiour. Thirdly, this de-
mand displeased both Samuel and God himself. Fourthly, yet God condescen-
ded to grant their suite, but with an admonition, and forewarning of the in-
conueniences, which they should finde and feele. Fiftly, God himself designed
the person that should be King, reueled him by vision, and commanded Samuel
to annoint him. Sixtly, God neuertheles by guiding the lotte, more manifestly
declared, and confirmed his election. Seuenthy, God deposed the same King,
for transgressing his law, *chap. 13. v. 13.* and disobeying his commandment.
*chap. 15. v. 23.* appointing an other, by the ministerie of Samuel. *chap. 16.*
Eightly, notwithstanding his deposition, he remained in his dignitie til his
death, which happened by other meanes. *chap. 31.* By al which it appeareth,
that God constituted Saul the first King of the Iewes, the people suing to haue
a King; but deposed him for euil behauiour, the people desiring no such thing,
and Samuel the Prophet much lamenting the same. Yet was he not actually be-
riued of the crowne and kingdom during his life.
