that dwelt in tabernacles, on the East side of Nobe, and
Iegbaa, stroke the campe of the enemies, which were secure,
<sup>11</sup> and suspected no mischance. <sup>12</sup> And Zebee and Salmana fled,
whom Gedeon pursuing apprehended, al their hoste being
<sup>13</sup> put out of aray. <sup>14</sup> And returning from the battel before
sunne rysing, <sup>15</sup> he tooke a boy of the men of Soccoth: and
he asked him the names of the princes and ancientes of Soc-
coth, and he described seuentie seuen men. <sup>16</sup> And he came
to Soccoth, and said to them: Behold Zebee, and Salmana
concerning whom you vpbraided me, saying: Peraduenture
the handes of Zebee and Salmana are in thy handes, and
therfore thou desirest that we geue bread to the men that be-
<sup>17</sup> wearie, and are fainte. <sup>18</sup> He tooke therefore the ancientes of
the citie, and thornes and briers of the desert, and tore them
with the same, and cut the men of Soccoth into pieces.
<sup>19</sup> The tower also of Phanuel he ouerthrew, killing the inha-
<sup>20</sup> bitantes of the citie. <sup>21</sup> And he said to Zebee and Salmana:
What manner of men were they, whom you slew in Thabor?
Who answered: Like vnto thee, and one of them as it were
<sup>22</sup> the sonne of a king. <sup>23</sup> To whom he answered: They were
my brethren, the sonnes of my mother. Our Lord liueth, that
<sup>24</sup> if you had saued them, <sup>25</sup> I would not kil you. <sup>26</sup> And he said
to Iether his eldest sonne: Arise, and kil them. Who drew not
out his sword: for he was afraid, because he was yet a boy.
<sup>27</sup> And Zebee and Salmana said: Doe thou rise, and runne
vpon vs: because acording to his age is the strength of a man.
Gedeon rose vp, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he tooke
the ornamentes and bosses, wherwith the neckes of kinges
<sup>28</sup> camels are wont to be adorned. <sup>29</sup> And al the men of Israel
said to Gedeon: Rule thou ouer vs, and thy sonne, and thy
sonnes sonne: because thou hast deliuered vs from the hand
<sup>30</sup> of Madian. <sup>31</sup> To whom he said: I wil not rule ouer you,
neither shal my sonne rule ouer you, but our Lord shal rule
<sup>32</sup> ouer you. <sup>33</sup> And he said to them: One petition I request of
you: Geue me the earlettes of your praye. For the Ismaelites
<sup>34</sup> were accustomed to haue golden earlettes. <sup>35</sup> Who answered:
we wil geue them most willingly. And spreading a mantel
on the ground, they cast on it the earlettes of the praye:
<sup>36</sup> and the weight of the earlettes that he desired, was a thou-
sand fiue hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornamentes, and
iewels, and purple vesture, which the kinges of Madian were
