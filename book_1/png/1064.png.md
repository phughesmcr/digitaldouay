king and Aman come to the banket, which I haue prepared them, and to morow I wil open my wil to the king. <sup>9</sup> Aman therfore went forth that day ioyful and merie. And when he had seene Mardocheus sitting before the doores of the palace, and not onlie not to haue risen vp to him, but not so much as to haue moued from the place where he sate, he was wrath excedingly: <sup>10</sup> and dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together vnto him his freindes, and Zares his wife: <sup>11</sup> and he declared to them the greatnesse of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glorie the king had aduanced him aboue al his princes and seruantes. <sup>12</sup> And after these things he said: Queene Esther also hath called none other to the banket with the king, but me: with whom to morow also I shal dine with the king. <sup>13</sup> And wheras I haue al these things, I thinke I haue nothing, so long as I shal see Mardocheus the Iew sitting before the kings doores. <sup>14</sup> And Zares his wife, & the rest of his frendes answered him: Command a great beame to be prepared, hauing fiftie cubites in height, and speake in the morning to the king, that Mardocheus may be hanged vpon it, and so thou shalt goe ioyful with the king to the banket. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded an high gallowes to be prepared.
