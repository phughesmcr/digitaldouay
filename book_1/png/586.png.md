Thy people my people, and thy God my God. <sup>17</sup> The land that shal receiue thee dying, in the same wil I die: and there wil I take a place for my burial. These thinges doe God to me, & these thinges adde he, if death onlie shal not separate me and thee. <sup>18</sup> Noemi therfore seing, that Ruth with a stedfast mind had determined to goe forward with her, would not be against it, nor perswade her any more to returne to her frendes: <sup>19</sup> and they went forth together, and came into Bethlehem.

Why therefore doe you cal me Noemi whom our Lord hath humbled, and the Almightie hath afflicted? <sup>22</sup> Noemi therfore came with Ruth the Moabite her daughter in law, from the Land of her peregrination: and returned into Bethlehem, when barley was first reaped.
