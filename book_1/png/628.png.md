And Dauid sayd to Saul: I can not goe so, because I am not
vsed, and he layd them of. <sup>40</sup> And he tooke his staffe, which
he had alwaies in his handes: & he chose him fiue most bright
stones out of the torrent, and cast them into the shepherds
skrippe, which he had with him, and he tooke a sling in his
hand, and went forth against the Philistian. <sup>41</sup> And the Phi-
listian went, going, and approching against Dauid, and his
esquire before him. <sup>42</sup> And when the Philistian had seene,
and beheld Dauid, he despised him. And he was a yong man
redde, and beautiful to behold. <sup>43</sup> And the Philistian sayd
to Dauid: Why am I a dogge, that thou comest to me with a
staffe? And the Philistian cursed Dauid in his goddes. <sup>44</sup> and
sayd to Dauid: Come to me, and I wil geue thy flesh to the
foules of the ayre and the beastes of the earth. <sup>45</sup> And Dauid
sayd to the Philistian: Thou comest to me with a sword, and
speare, and sheeld, but I come to thee in the name of the
Lord of hosts, the God of the bandes of Israel, whom thou
hast defied <sup>46</sup> this day, and our Lord shal geue thee in my
hand, and I shal strike thee, and take away thy head from
thee: and I shal geue the carcasses of the campe of the Phi-
listijms this day, to the fowles of the ayre, and to the beastes
of the earth: that al the earth may knowe that there is a God
in Israel. <sup>47</sup> And al this assemblie shal know, that not in sword,
nor in speare, doth our Lord saue, for it is his battel, and he
wil deliuer you into our handes. <sup>48</sup> When the Philistian there-
fore was risen vp, and came and approched against Dauid,
Dauid made hast, & ranne to the battel against the Philistian.
<sup>49</sup> And he put his hand into his skrippe, and tooke one stone,
and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about stroke the
Philistian in the forehead, and he fel on his face vpon the
earth. <sup>50</sup> And Dauid preuailed agaynst the Philistian with
sling and stone, and he stroke, and slew the Philistian. And
whereas Dauid had no sword in his hand, <sup>51</sup> he ranne, and
stood vpon the Philistian, and tooke his sword, and drew it
out of the scabard, and slew him, and cut of his head. And
the Philistijms seing, that the strongest of them was dead, did
flee. <sup>52</sup> And the men of Israel and Iuda rising vp shouted, and
pursued the Philistians til they came into a valley to the gates
of Accaron, and there fel wounded of the Philistijms in the
way of Saraim, as farre as Geth, & as farre as Accaron. <sup>53</sup> And
the children of Israel returning, after they had pursued the
Philistians,
