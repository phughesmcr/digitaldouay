<sup>38</sup> that looketh to the oke. To whom Zebul said: Where is
now thy mouth, wherwith thou didst speake? Who is Abi-
melech that we should serue him? Is not this the people,
which thou didst despise? Goe forth, and fight against him.
<sup>39</sup> Gaal therfore went, the people of the Sichimites looking
on, and fought against Abimelech, <sup>40</sup> who pursued him
fleeing, and driue him into the citie: and there were slaine
of his part manie, vnto the gate of the citie: <sup>41</sup> and Abi-
melech sate in Ruma: but Zebul expelled Gaal, and his
companions out of the citie, neither did he suffer them to
abide in it. <sup>42</sup> Therefore the day folowing the people went
forth into the field. Which being told to Abimelech, <sup>43</sup> he
tooke his armie, and diuided it into three troupes, setting
ambushmentes in the fieldes. And seeing that the people came
out of the citie, he arose, & set vpon them <sup>44</sup> with his owne
troupe, oppugning and besieging the citie: and two troupes
scattered through the field pursewed the aduersaries. <sup>45</sup> More-
ouer Abimelech al that day oppugned the citie: which he
tooke, & killed the inhabitantes therof, and destroyed it, so
that he :: sowed salt in it. <sup>46</sup> Which when they had heard
that dwelt in the towre of Sichem, they entered into the
temple of their god Berith, where they had made a couenant
with him, and therof the place had taken his name, which
was exceeding wel fensed. <sup>47</sup> Abimelech also hearing that the
<sup>48</sup> men of the towre of Sichem were gathered together, <sup>48</sup> he
went vp into mount Selmon with al his people: and taking
an axe, he cut of the bough of a tree, and laying it on his
shoulder & carying it, he said to his companions: That which
you see me do, doe ye out of hand. <sup>49</sup> They therefore cut-
ting of boughes from the trees, euerie man as fast as he could,
folowed their captaine. Who compassing the forte burnt it:
and so it came to passe, that with the smoke and the fyre a
thousand persons were slaine, men and women together, of
<sup>50</sup> the inhabitantes of the towre of Sichem. <sup>50</sup> And Abimelech
departing thence came to the towne of Thebes, which com-
<sup>51</sup> passing he besieged with his armie. <sup>51</sup> And there was in the
middes of the citie an high towre, to the which were fled
both men and women together, and al the princes of the
citie, the gate being shut very strongly, and they stan-
ding vpon the batlementes of the towre by the bulwarkes.
<sup>52</sup> And Abimelech coming nere the towre, fought manfully:
