mouthes of them that prayse thee, and extinguish the glorie of thy temple and altar, <sup>10</sup> that they may open the mouthes of Gentiles, and prayse the strength of idols, and magnifie a carnal king for euer. <sup>11</sup> Deliuer not 么 Lord thy scepter to them that are not, lest they laugh at our ruine: but turne their counsel vpon them, and destroy him, that hath begune to do cruelly against vs. <sup>12</sup> Remember 么 Lord: and shew thy self to vs in the time of our tribulation, and geue me confidence Lord king of goddes, and of al power: <sup>13</sup> geue me speech wel framed in my mouth in the presence of the lion, and turne his hart into the hatred of our enemie, that both him self may perish, and the rest that consent vnto him. <sup>14</sup> But deliuer vs in thy hand, and helpe me, hauing no other helpe, but thee 么 Lord which hast the knowlege of al things, <sup>15</sup> and knowest that I hate the glorie of the wicked, and detest the bed of the vncircumcised, and of euerie stranger. <sup>16</sup> Thou knowest my necessitie, that I abhorre the signe of my pride and glorie, which is vpon my head in the daies of my ostentation, and detest it as the cloth of a woman in her monthlie floores, and weare it not in the daies of my silence, <sup>17</sup> and that I haue not eaten at Amans table, neither the kings banket hath pleased me, and that I haue not drunke the wine of libamentes: <sup>18</sup> and that thy handmayde did neuer reioyce, since I was transported hither vnto this day, but in thee 么 Lord the God of Abraham. <sup>19</sup> O God strong aboue al, heare the voyce of them, that haue no other hope, and deliuer vs from the hand of the wicked, and deliuer me from my feare.

CHAP. XV.

*Mardocheus causeth Esther to goe to the king and intreate for the people. She is terrified by this countenance, but God turneth his hart, and he calleth her curteously to him.*

*This also I found added in the common edition.*

AND he commanded her (no doubt but Mardocheus comman-<sup>1</sup>ded Esther) that she should goe vnto the king, and make petition for her people and for her countrie. <sup>2</sup> Remember (quoth he) the daies of thy humilitie, how thou wast brought vp in my hand, because Aman the second after the king hath spoken against vs vnto death: <sup>3</sup> and doe thou inuocate our Lord, and speake to the king for vs, & deliuer vs from death.

*Moreouer this also which foloweth, I found in the common Greke.*

[^1]: Idoles are nothing in the world. 1. Cor. 8. but bare imaginations of men.

<aside>The Church vseth this prayer in the offertorie the 22. sunday after Pente-cost: as a parcel of holie Scripture.</aside>

<aside>Of herselfe, nor for worldlie glorie she desired not to marie a hea-then king but for the comon good she ma-ried him, God dispensing with the law in this behalf. See ch. 2.</aside>
