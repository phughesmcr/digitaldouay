Achab. Elias

Alias: because thou hast done, to prouoke me to anger, and hast made Israel to sinne. <sup>23</sup> But of Iezabel also our Lord spake, saying: The dogges shal eate Iezabel in the field of Iezrahel. <sup>24</sup> If Achab die in the citie, the dogges shal eate him: but if he die in the field, the foules of the ayre shal eate him. <sup>25</sup> Therefore there was not such an other as Achab, who :: was sold to doe euil in the sight of our Lord: for his wife Iezabel sette him on, <sup>26</sup> and he became abominable, in so much that he folowed the idols, which the Amorrheites had made, whom our Lord consumed before the face of the children of Israel. <sup>27</sup> Therefore when Achab had heard these wordes, he rent his garmentes, and couered his flesh with haercloth, and fasted and slept in sackcloth, and walked casting downe his head. <sup>28</sup> And the word of our Lord came to Elias the Thesbite, saying: <sup>29</sup> Hast thou not seene Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he hath humbled him self for my sake, I wil not bring in the euil in his dayes, but in his sonnes daies wil I bring the euil vpon his house.

Ochozias foloweth the euil steppes of his parents.*

THere passed therefore three yeares without warre betwen Syria and Israel. <sup>2</sup> And in the third yeare, Iosaphat the king of Iuda went downe to the king of Israel. <sup>3</sup> (And the king of Israel sayd to his seruantes: are you ignorant that Ramoth-Galaad is ours, and we neglect to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?) <sup>4</sup> And he sayd to Iosaphat: Wilt thou come with me to fight into Ramoth Galaad? <sup>5</sup> And Iosaphat sayd to the king of Israel: As I am, so thou also: my people and thy people are one: and my horsemen thy horsemen. And Iosaphat sayd to the king of Israel: Aske, I beseech thee, this day, the word of our Lord. <sup>6</sup> The king of Israel therefore assembled the prophetes, about foure hundred men, and he sayd to them: Shal I goe into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sitte stil? Who answered: Goe vp, and our Lord wil geue it into the kinges hand. <sup>7</sup> And Iosaphat sayd: " Is there not
