## Chap. XVI.

Iob moued by his importune freindes, 4. expostulath their seueritie, 12. further describeth his afflictions, and appealeth to Gods iudgement, that he suffereth more then his sinnes deserue.

<aside>True and freindlie comforters ought to heare the afflicted with patience, and not vnmercifully charge him with crimes which they neither know, nor his conscience is guiltie of.</aside>

<sup>1</sup>But Iob answering sayd: I haue heard often times such things, heauie comforters you are al. <sup>2</sup>Shal wordes ful of winde haue an end? or is anie thing trublesome to thee, if thou speake? <sup>3</sup>I also could speake thinges like to you: and would God your soule were for my soule. <sup>4</sup>I also would comfort you with wordes, and would wag my head vpon you. <sup>5</sup>I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would moue my lippes, as sparing you. <sup>6</sup>But what shal I doe? If I speake, my paine wil not rest: and if I hold my peace, it wil not depart from me. <sup>7</sup>But now my sorow hath oppressed me, and al my limmes are brought to nothing. <sup>8</sup>My wrinkles giue testimonie against me, and a false speaker is raysed vp against my face contradicting me. <sup>9</sup>He hath gathered his furie vpon me, and threatening me hath gnashed against me with his teeth, mine enemy hath beheld me with terrible eies. <sup>10</sup>They haue opened their mouthes vpon me, and exprobating haue stroken my cheke, they are filled with my paines. <sup>11</sup>God hath shut me vp with the wicked man, and hath deliuered me to the hands of the impious. <sup>12</sup>I sometime that welthie one sodenly am broken: he hath held my necke, broken me, and set me to himself as it were a marke. <sup>13</sup>He hath compassed me with his speares, he hath wounded my loynes, he hath not spared, and hath powred out on the earth my bowels. <sup>14</sup>He hath cut me with wound vpon wound, he hath come violent­ly vpon me as it were a giant. <sup>15</sup>I haue sowed sackcloth vpon my skinne, and haue couered my flesh with ashes. <sup>16</sup>My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyeliddes are dimme. <sup>17</sup>These thinges haue I suffred without the iniquitie of my hand, wheras I had cleane prayers to God. <sup>18</sup>Earth couer not my bloud, neither let my crie find place in thee to be hid. <sup>19</sup>For behold my witnesse is in heauen, and he that knoweth my conscience on high. <sup>20</sup>My freindes ful of wor­des: mine eie distilleth vnto God. <sup>21</sup>And would God a man might so be iudged with God, as the sonne of man is iudged with his companion. <sup>22</sup>For behold the short yeares passe a­way, and I walke the path, by the which I shal not returne.
