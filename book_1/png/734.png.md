Salomon

754 Abesan of Iuda; Aialon of Zabulon; Abdon of Ephraim; Sampson of Dan; and Heli, who was also high priest of Aarons stocke; otherwise called Zaraias (1. Paralip. 6.) and Samuel also of the tribe of Leui a Prophet.

In his time the people demanding and vrging to haue a King, Saul of the tribe of Beniamin was annointed. 1. Reg. 10. But for transgressing Gods commandments, especially for exercising spiritual function without warrant (1. Reg. 13.) and not destroying idolaters (1. Reg. 15.) was deposed, and Dauid of the tribe of Iuda was annointed King; who after manie great trubles, possessed the whole kingdome, and died in peace, hauing his sonne Salomon invested and annointed king in his throne.

The Church being thus established in distinct states and orders, albeit there were manie imperfections in al sorts of persons, and great sinnes committed, yet God so punished offenders, and chastised the whole people, that he stil conserued, the greatest, or chiefe part, in true faith and religion. For whiles they were in the desert, they murmured very often against God, and his Ministers their Superiors. (Exod. 17. Num. 11. 14. 20. 21.) Manie fel to idolatrie (Exod. 32.) Aaron not free from cooperating in the peoples sinne. Nadab and Abiu Aarons sonnes, and consecrated priestes, offered strange fire (Leuit. 10.) Core Dathan and Abiron, with their complices made a great schisme (Num. 16.) Manie committed carnal fornication with Infidels; and were therby drawen to spiritual (Num. 25.) Of which and other like sinnes the Psalmist speaketh (Psal. 94.) exhorting his people not to harden their hartes, as in the desert their fathers had tempted God. Fourtie yeares was I offended (sayth God) with that generation, and sayd: They alwayes erre in hart. And therfore he sware in his wrath: that the same generation should not enter into the promised land of Chanaan: but their children entred and possessed it. Num. 14. Iosue. 3.

Againe the people falling to idolatrie and other sinnes, were afflicted and sore pressed by forraine enemies, but repenting were deliuered and saued by certaine captaines called Iudges and <sup>*</sup>Sauiours: as appeareth in the booke of Iudges. They had also tribulations by some of their owne nation, for among the Iudges one (called Abimelec) was a tyrannical vsurper. (Iudic. 9.) Saul their first King falling from God vniustly persecuted Dauid. 1. Reg. 18. &c. Ambitious Absolom rebelled against the King his father. (2. Reg. 15.) and Seba of the tribe of Beniamin raised an other rebellion (2. Reg. 20.) Likewise Adonias, assisted by Abiathar the high priest, and by Ioab general of the armie, pretended to reigne his father Dauid yet liuing, to preuent Salomon of the kingdom (3. Reg. 1.) So God both shewed his iustice, in suffering such afflictions to happen, for punishment of sinne: and his mercie, in sauing his Church from ruine.
