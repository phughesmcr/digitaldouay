right hand of Iesimon. <sup>25</sup> Saul therefore and his companie
went to seeke him: and it was told Dauid, and forthwith he
went downe to the rocke, and abode in the desert Maon,
which when Saul had heard, he pursued Dauid in the desert
Maon. <sup>26</sup> And Saul went at the side of the mountaine on
the one part: and Dauid and his men were in the side of the
mountaine on the other part: moreouer Dauid despayred
that he could escape, from the face of Saul: Saul therefore
and his men in maner of a ring, compassed Dauid and his
men, to take them. <sup>27</sup> And a messenger came to Saul, saying:
Make hast, and come, because the Philistijms haue powred

went: and there was a caue, which Saul entred into, to doe
his easement: moreouer Dauid and his men lay hid in the

him: Behold the day, whereof our Lord sayd to thee: I wil
deliuer thee thyne enemie, that thou mayest doe to him as it
