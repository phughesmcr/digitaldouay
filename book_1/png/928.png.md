they that wrought did industriously, and the breach of the
walles was closed by their handes, and they raysed the house
of our Lord into the old state, and made it stand firmly.
<sup>14</sup> And when they had accomplished al the workes, they
brought the rest of the money before the king and Ioiada: of
the which were made vessels of the temple to the ministerie,
and for holocaustes, phials also, and other vessels of gold and
silver: and holocaustes were offered in the house of our Lord
continually al the daies of Ioiada. <sup>15</sup> But Ioiada became old
being ful of dayes, and died when he was an hundred and
thirtie yeares old. <sup>16</sup> And they buried him in the citie of David
with the kinges, because he had done good with Israel, and
with his house. <sup>17</sup> And after that Ioiada was dead, the princes
of Iuda went in, and adored the king, who being altered by
their serviceablenesse, agreed to them. <sup>18</sup> And they forsooke
the temple of our Lord the God of their fathers, and served
groves, and sculptiles, and there came wrath agaynst Iuda,
and Ierusalem for this sinne. <sup>19</sup> And he sent them prophetes,
that they should returne to our Lord, whom protesting they
would not heare. <sup>20</sup> The spirit of God therfore invested Za-
charias the sonne of Ioiada the Priest, & he stood in the sight
of the people, and sayd to them: Thus sayth our Lord God:
Why transgresse you the precept of our Lord, which thing
shal not profit you, & have forsaken our Lord, that he should
forsake you? <sup>21</sup> Who being gathered agaynst him, they threw
stones according to the kinges commandement, in the court
of the house of our Lord. <sup>22</sup> And Ioas the king did not re-
member the mercie, that Ioiada his father had done with him,
but he killed his sonne. Who when he died, sayd: Our Lord
see, and require it. <sup>23</sup> And when a yeare was come about, the
armie of Syria came vp against him: & it came into Iuda & Ie-
rusalem, & slew al the princes of the people, and al the pray
they sent to the king into Damascus. <sup>24</sup> And wheras there was
come a very smal number of the Syrians, our Lord delivered
into their handes an infinite multitude, for that they had for-
saken our Lord the God of their fathers: on Ioas also they ex-
ercised ignomious iudgementes. <sup>25</sup> And departing they left
him in great diseases: and his servantes rose agaynst him,
for revenge of the bloud of the sonne of Ioiada the priest, &
they slew him in his bed, & he dyed: and they buried him in
the Citie of David, but not in the kinges sepulchres. <sup>26</sup> And
