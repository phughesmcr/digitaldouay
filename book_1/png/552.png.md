# IVDGES, CHAP. VIII.

The Ephraimites quarelling because they were not called to the warres, are paci-
fied by Gedeon. 4. The men of Soccoth and Phanuel denying victuels for
the campe, Gedeon (in the meane time (10.) ouerthrowing the enemie) 15.
reuengeth their reprochful contempt. 18. killeth Zebee and Salmana. 22. re-
fuseth dominion, 24. but receiueth as a gift, the iewels taken in the praye.
27. maketh therof an Ephod, which turneth to the ruine of his familie, 30.
Hauing seuentie sonnes by his wiues, and one by a concubine, dieth in good
old age. 33. and the people fal againe to idolatrie.

Is not the cluster of Ephraim better then the vintages of Abiezer? <sup>3</sup> Into your handes hath our Lord deliuered the princes of Madian, Oreb and Zeb, what could I haue done the like as you haue done? Which when he had spoken, their spirit rested, wherwith they did swel against him. <sup>4</sup> And when Gedeon was come to Iordan, he passed ouer it with the three hundred men, that were with him: and for wearines, they could not pursew them that fled. <sup>5</sup> And he said to the men of Soccoth: Geue, I beseech you, bread to the people, that is with me, because they are verie faint: that we may pursew Zebee, and Salmana the kinges of Madian. <sup>6</sup> The princes of Soccoth answered: Peraduenture the palmes of the handes of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, & therfore thou requirest that we geue bread to thy armie. <sup>7</sup> To whom he said: When our Lord therfore shal haue deliuered Zebee and Salmana into my handes, I wil teare your flesh with the thornes, and briers of the desert. <sup>8</sup> And going vp from thence, he came into Phanuel: and he spake to the men of that place the like thinges. To whom they also answered, as the men of Soccoth had answered. <sup>9</sup> He said therfore to them also: When I shal be returned conquerour in peace, I wil destroy this towre. <sup>10</sup> But Zebee and Salmana rested with al their armie. For fiftene thousand men were remay-ning of al the troupes of the East peoples, an hundred and twentie thousand fighting men and those that drew sword, being slayne. <sup>11</sup> And Gedeon going vp by the way of them,
