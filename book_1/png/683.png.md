It was better for me to be there: I beseech thee therefore that I may see the face of the king: & if he be mindeful of mine iniquitie, let him kil me. <sup>33</sup> Ioab therefore entring in to the king, told him al thinges: and Absalom was called, and he entered in to the king: and adored vpon the face of the earth before him: and the king kissed Absalom.
