<aside>Ioachaz. Ioas.</aside>

IN the three and twenteth yeare of Ioas the sonne of O-
chozias the king of Iuda, reigned Ioachaz the sonne of
Iehu ouer Israel in Samaria, seuentene yeares. <sup>2</sup> And he did
euil before our Lord, and folowed the sinnes of Ieroboam
the sonne of Nabat, who made Israel to sinne, and declined
not from them. <sup>3</sup> And the furie of our Lord was wratha-
gaynst Israel, and he deliuered them into the hand of Hazael
the king of Syria, and into the hand of Benadad the sonne of
Hazael, alwaies. <sup>4</sup> But Ioachaz besought the face of our Lord,
and our Lord heard him: for he saw the distresse of Israel, that
the king of Syria had broken them: <sup>5</sup> and our Lord gaue a
sauiour to Israel, and they were deliuered out of the hand of
the king of Syria: and the children of Israel dwelt in their ta-
bernacles as yesterday and the day before. <sup>6</sup> But yet they de-
parted not from the sinnes of Ieroboam who made Israel to
sinne, but they walked in them: for the groue also remayned
in Samaria. <sup>7</sup> And there were leaft to Ioachaz of the people
but fiftie horsemen, and ten chariotes, and ten thousand foot-
men: for the king of Syria had slaine them, and had brought
them as dust by threshing in the barne floore. <sup>8</sup> But the rest
of the wordes of Ioachaz, and al that he did, and his strength,
are not these thinges writen in the Booke of the wordes of
the daies of the kinges of Israel? <sup>9</sup> And Ioachaz slept with
his fathers, & they buried him in Samaria: and Ioas his sonne
reigned for him. <sup>10</sup> In the seuen and thirteth yeare of Ioas the
king of Iuda reigned Ioas the sonne of Ioachaz ouer Israel in
Samaria sixtene yeares, <sup>11</sup> and he did that which is euil in the
sight of our Lord, he declined not from al the sinnes of Iero-
boam the sonne of Nabat, who made Israel to sinne, but he
walked in them. <sup>12</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ioas, and
al that he did, and his strength, how he fought agaynst Ama-
sias the king of Iuda, are not these thinges writen in the
Booke of the wordes of the dayes of the kinges of Israel?
<sup>13</sup> And Ioas slept with his fathers: but Ieroboam sate vpon
his throne. Moreouer Ioas, was buried in Samaria with the
kinges of Israel. <sup>14</sup> And Eliseus was sicke of an infirmitie,
wherof also he died: and Ioas the king of Israel went downe
to him,
