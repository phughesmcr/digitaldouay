there is not the like to him in al the people. And al the people
cried, and sayd: God saue the King. <sup>25</sup> And Samuel spake to
the people the law of the kingdom, and wrote it in a booke,
and layd it vp before our Lord: and Samuel dismissed al the
people, euerie one into his owne house. <sup>26</sup> But Saul also departed vnto his house into Gabaa: and there went with him
part of the armie, they whose hartes God had touched. <sup>27</sup> But
the children of Belial sayd: What shal this fellow be able to
saue vs? and they despised him, and brought him not presentes: but he dissembled as though he heard not.

CHAP. XI.

[^1] And it came to passe as it were a moneth after, Naas
the Ammonite ascended, and began to fight against
Iabes of Galaad. And al the men of Iabes sayd to Naas: Make
a league with vs, and we wil serue thee. <sup>2</sup> And Naas the
Ammonite answered them: In this wil I make a league with
you, that I may plucke out the right eyes of you al, and may
make you a reproch in al Israel. <sup>3</sup> And the ancientes of Iabes
sayd to him: Graunt vnto vs seuen daies, that we may send
messengers to al the coastes of Israel: and if there shal not
be that may defend vs, we wil come forth to thee. <sup>4</sup> The
messengers therefore came into Gabaa of Saul: and they
spake these wordes, in the hearing of the people: and al the
people lifted vp their voice, and wept. <sup>5</sup> And behold Saul
came, folowing oxen out of the field, and sayd: What ayleth
the people that they weepe? And they told him the wordes
of the men of Iabes. <sup>6</sup> And the Spirit of our Lord seased on
Saul, when he had heard these wordes, and his furie was exceding wrath. <sup>7</sup> And taking both the oxen, he cutte them
into peeces, and sent them into al the coastes of Israel by messengers, saying: Whosoeuer shal not goe forth, and folow
Saul and Samuel, so shal it be done to his oxen. Therefore
the feare of our Lord inuaded the people, and they went
forth as it were one man. <sup>8</sup> And he numbered them in Bezec:
and there were of the children of Israel three hundred thousand: and of the men of Iuda thirtie thousand. <sup>9</sup> And they
sayd to the messengers that came: Thus shal you say to the
men,
