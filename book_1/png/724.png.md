whether they would walke in his law or no. *And after making couenant with them* (Exod. 19. Deut. 26.) *required and accepted their voluntarie consent: entring into formal contracte or bargaine betwen himself and them: he promising on the one partie* to make them his peculiar people, a priestly kingdome, and a holie nation: *they on the other partie promising loyaltie, obedience and obseruation of his commandements, saying: Al* thinges that our Lord hath spoken we wil doe. *For which cause Gods promises are conditional* (Deut. 7.) if thou kepe his iudgements, God wil keepe his couenant to thee. *Againe most plainly* (Deut. 11.) Behold I sette before your sight this day benediction and malediction, *and* (Deut. 30.) I cal for witnesses this day heauen and earth, that I haue proposed to you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therfore life that thou mayest liue. *In al which it is certaine that Gods promise being firme, mans wil is variable, and so the euent not necessarie: which made Caleb hoping of victorie to say* (Iosue 14.) if perhaps our Lord be with me. *Neither doth Gods foreknowledge make the euent necessarie, for he seeth the effect in the cause, as it is voluntarie or casual: yea God knoweth al before, and some times foretelleth thinges, which conditionally would happen, and in deed (the condition fayling) come not to passe, as* (1. Reg. 23.) God answered, that the men of Ceila would betray Dauid (meaning if he staied there) *which they did not: for he parted from thence. Yet is man able by this his freedome, nor otherwise of himself, to do, nor so much as thinke anie good thing but through Gods mere motion, and grace, geuen him without his deseruing; sufficient to al, and effectual to those that accept it. God also geueth particular grace for special functions; as* (Leuit. 8) *to Priestes* (Num. 11.) *to seuentie ancients, and* (1. Reg. 10.) *to king Saul.*

*By which diuine assistance the commandements of God are possible, as himself auoucheth, saying:* (Deut. 30.) This commandment that I command thee this day is not aboue thee. *Againe; I haue sette before thee life and good, death and euil, that thou mayest loue God, walke in his wayes, and keepe his commandementes.*

*Workes done by grace and freewil are good and commendable, yea (so testifying* (Deut. 14.) This is your wisdome and vnderstanding before peoples *) are meritorious: and rewardes are promised for the same* (Leuit. 26.) *and contrariwise punishments threatned to the transgressours. And Booz knowing reward to be due for wel doing, prayed God to render to Ruth* (ch. 2.) *a ful reward for her wel deseruing. The royal prophet affirmeth* (Psalm. 18.) *that in keeping Gods preceptes is much reward. And* (Psal. 118.) *professeth that he inclined his hart to keepe them for reward.*

*Amongst other seruices of God, and meanes of mens saluation, external Sacrifice*
