And one of the seruantes of the king of Israel answered: Here is Eliseus the sonne of Saphat, which powred water vpon the handes of Elias. <sup>12</sup> And Iosaphat sayd: The word of our Lord is with him. And the king of Israel went downe to him, and Iosaphat the king of Iuda, and the king of Edom. <sup>13</sup> And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What is to me and thee? goe to the prophetes of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him: Why hath our Lord gathered together these three kinges, that he might deliuer them into the handes of Moab? <sup>14</sup> And Eliseus said to him: The Lord of hostes liueth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reuerence the face of Iosaphat the king of Iuda, I would not certes haue harkened to thee, nor looked on thee. <sup>15</sup> But now bring me hither a plaier on instrumentes.

They therfore that had ouercome, came and stroke Moab, and
