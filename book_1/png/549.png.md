risen in the morning, they saw the altar of Baal destroyed, and the groue cut downe, and the other bullocke laid vpon the altar, which then was built. <sup>29</sup> And they said one to an other: Who hath done this? And when they inquired for the author of the fact, it was said: Gedeon the sonne of Ioas did al these thinges. <sup>30</sup> And they said to Ioas: Bring forth thy sonne hither, that he may die: because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut downe his groue. <sup>31</sup> To whom he answered: Why are you reuengers of Baal, that you fight for him? he that is his aduersarie, let him die before to morrow light appeare: if he be God, reuenge he him self, on him that hath raysed his altar. <sup>32</sup> From that day Gedeon was called Ierobaal, because Ioas had said: Let Baal reuenge him self on him, that hath raysed his altar. <sup>33</sup> Therefore al Madian, and Amalec, and the east peoples were gathered together, and passing ouer Iordan, camped in the vaile Iezrael. <sup>34</sup> But the spirit of our Lord reuested Gedeon, who sounding with a trumpet called together the house of Abiezer, to folow him. <sup>35</sup> And he sent messengers into al Manasses, which it selfe also did folow him: and other messengers into Aser and Zabulon and Nepthali, which mette him. <sup>36</sup> And Gedeon said to God: If thou saue Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken, <sup>37</sup> I wil putte this fleece of wool on the floore: if there shal be dew in the fleece onlie, and on al the ground drienes, I shal know that by my hand, as thou hast spoken, thou wilt deliuer Israel. <sup>38</sup> And it came so to passe. And rysing in the night wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew. <sup>39</sup> And he said againe to God: Let not thy furie be angrie against me if I tempt once againe, seeking a signe in the fleece. I desire that the fleece onlie may be drie, and al the ground wette with dew. <sup>40</sup> And God did that night as he had requested: and there was drienes in the fleece onlie, and dew on al the ground.
