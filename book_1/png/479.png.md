An exhortation to serue God, with prediction of their often-sinnes and punishmentes.</aside>

<sup>1</sup>MOYSES therfore went, and spake al these wordes to al Israel, <sup>2</sup>and said to them: I am this day a hundred and twentie yeares old, I can not goe out and come in any longer, especially wheras our Lord also hath said to me: <sup>3</sup>Thou shalt not passe ouer this Iordan. Our Lord therfore thy God wil passe ouer before thee: he wil destroy al these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possesse them: and this Iosue shal passe ouer before thee, as our Lord hath spoken. <sup>4</sup>And our Lord shal doe to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kinges of the Amorrheites, and to their land, and shal destroy them. <sup>5</sup>Therfore when our Lord shal haue deliuered these also to you, you shal doe in like manner to them as I haue commanded you. <sup>6</sup>Doe manfully, and be strengthned: feare not, neither tremble ye at their sight: because our Lord thy God him selfe is thy conductor, and wil not leaue, nor forsake thee. <sup>7</sup>And Moyses called Iosue, and said to him before al Israel: Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt bring in this people into the Land, which our Lord sware that he would geue to their fathers, and thou shalt diuide it by lotte. <sup>8</sup>And our Lord that is your conductor, him selfe wil

But you wil aske: How then cometh it to passe, that manie hauing receiued sufficient grace, yet do not kepe Gods commandmentes? God him self answereth:

[^3]: That he hath set before thee life and good, and contrarywise death and euil, he inuiteth and helpeth, yet forceth thee not: he geueth thee power & abilitie, helping and not destroying thy freewil, that thou maist loue our Lord thy God, walke in his wayes, and kepe his commandments. But if thy hart be auerted and (v. 17.) thou wilt not heare, thou shalt perish. Againe God inculcateth:

[^4]: I cal for witnesses heauen and earth, that I haue proposed to you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therfore life &c. VVhat Doctor can teach more plainly the possibilitie of keeping Gods commandmentes; and freewil in man, then this text of holie Scripture?
