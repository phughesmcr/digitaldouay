and mercie before him aboue al the wemen, and he put the
crowne of the kingdom on her head, and made her reigne in
steede of Vasthi. <sup>18</sup> And he commanded a verie magnifical
feast to be prepared to al the princes, and to his seruantes, for
the coniunction, and mariage of Esther. And he gaue rest to
