And Eliseus spake to the woman, whose sonne he resto-
red to life, saying: Arise, goe thou and thy house, and
soiourne whersoever thou shalt finde: for our Lord hath
called a famine, and it shal come vpon the land seuen yeares.
<sup>2</sup>Who arose, & did according to the word of the man of God:
& going with her houshould, she soiourned in the land of the
Philistijms many dayes. <sup>3</sup>And when the seuen yeares were en-
ded, the woman returned out of the Land of the Philisthijms:
and she went forth to speake to the king for her house, and for
her landes. <sup>4</sup>And the king spake with Giezi the seruant of
the man of God, saying: Tel me al the meruelous thinges that
Eliseus hath done. <sup>5</sup>And when he had told the king how he
had raysed a dead man, the woman appeared, whose sonne he
had reuiued, crying to the king for her house, and her landes.
And Giezi sayd: My lord king, this is the woman, and this is
her sonne, whom Eliseus raysed. <sup>6</sup>And the king asked the
woman: who told him. And the king gaue her an eunuch,
saying: Restore her al thinges that are hers, and al the reue-
newes of the landes, from the day, that she left the land vntil
this present. <sup>7</sup>Eliseus also came to Damascus, and Benadad
the king of Syria was sicke: and they told him, saying: The
man of God cometh hither. <sup>8</sup>And the king sayd to Hazael:
Take with thee presentes, and goe to meete the man of God,
and consult the Lord by him, saying: Can I escape of this
myne infirmitie? <sup>9</sup>Hazael therefore went to meete him, ha-
uing with him presentes, and al good thinges of Damascus,
the lodes of fourtie camels. And when he stood before him,
he sayd: Thy sonne Benadad the king of Syria hath sent me
to thee, saying: Can I recouer of this mine infirmitie? <sup>10</sup>And
Eliseus sayd to him: Goe, tel him: Thou shalt be healed:
but our Lord hath shewed me that dying he shal die. <sup>11</sup>And
he stood with him, and was trubled so far that he blushed:
and the man of God wept. <sup>12</sup>To whom Hazael sayd: Why
doeth my lord weepe? But he sayd: Because I know what
euils thou wilt doe to the children of Israel. Their sensed ci-
ties thou wilt burne with fyre, and their yongmen thou wilt
kil with the sword, and their litle ones thou wilt dash in pee-
ces, and women with childe thou wilt diuide. <sup>13</sup>And Hazael
sayd: What am I thy seruant a dog, that I should doe this
great thing? And Eliseus sayd: Our Lord hath shewed me
that thou shalt be king of Syria. <sup>14</sup>Who when he was departed
