not walked in my waies, to doe iustice before me, and my preceptes, and iudgementes as Dauid his father. <sup>34</sup> Neither wil I take away al the kingdom out of his hand, but I wil make him prince al the daies of his life, for Dauid my seruant, whom I chose, who kept my commandmentes and my preceptes. <sup>35</sup> But I wil take away the kingdom out of his sonnes hand, and wil geue thee ten tribes: <sup>36</sup> and to his sonne I wil geue one tribe, that there may remayne a lampe to Dauid my seruant at al times before me in Ierusalem, the citie which I haue chosen, that my name might be there. <sup>37</sup> And thee wil I take, and thou shalt reigne ouer al thinges, that thy soule desireth, and thou shalt be king ouer Israel. <sup>38</sup> If therfore thou wilt heare al thinges, that I shal command thee, and wilt walke in my waies, and doe that which is right before me, keeping my commandmentes and my preceptes, as Dauid my seruant did: I wil be with thee, and wil build thee a faythful house, as I built a house to Dauid, and I wil deliuer Israel to thee: <sup>39</sup> and I wil afflict the seede of Dauid vpon this, but yet not alwaies. <sup>40</sup> Salomon therfore would haue killed Ieroboam: who arose, and fled into Ægypt to Sesac the king of Ægypt, and was in Ægypt vntil the death of Salomon. <sup>41</sup> And the rest of the wordes of Salomon, and al that he did, and his wisedom: behold they are al written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of Salomon. <sup>42</sup> And the daies, that Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer al Israel, are fourtie yeares. <sup>43</sup> And Salomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid his father, and Roboam his sonne reigned for him.
