Esdras the Priest arose, and said to them: You have trans<sup>11</sup>gressed, and taken strange women to wife, to adde vpon the sinne of Israel. And now geue confession to our Lord the God of your fathers, and doe his pleasure, and be separated from the peoples of the land, and from your wiues the stran<sup>12</sup>gers. And al the multitude answered, and sayd with a lowde <sup>13</sup>voyce: According to thy word vnto vs, so be it done. Neuer-thelesse because there is much people, and a tyme of rayne, and we can not abyde to stand without, and it is not a worke of one day or two (for we haue excedingly sinned in this <sup>14</sup>thing) let there be princes appoynted in al the multitude: and let al in our cities that haue taken strangers to wife, come at sette tymes, and with them the ancientes by citie and citie, and the iudges therof, vntil the wrath of our God be turned <sup>15</sup>away from vs for this sinne. Therfore Ionathan the sonne of Azahel, and Iaazia the sonne of Thecua were appoynted ouer this, and Mesollam and Sebethai Leuites did helpe <sup>16</sup>them: and the children of the transmigration did so. And Esdras the Priest, and the men, princes of the families went into the houses of theyr fathers, and al by theyr names, and they sate in the first day of the tenth moneth to search out <sup>17</sup>the matter. And al the men were fully counted that had <sup>18</sup>taken strangers to wife, vnto the first day of the first moneth. And there were found of the sonnes of the Priestes that had taken strangers to wife. Of the children of Iosue the sonne of Iosedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eliezer, <sup>19</sup>and Iarib, and Godolia. And they gaue theyr handes to put away theyr wiues, and to offer for theyr offence a ramme of <sup>20</sup>the flocke. And of the children of Emmer, Hanani, and <sup>21</sup>Zebedia. And of the children of Harim, Maasia, and Elia, <sup>22</sup>and Semeia, and Iehiel, and Ozias. And of the children of Pheshur, Elionai, Maasia, Ismael, Nathanael, Iozabed, and <sup>23</sup>Elasa. And of the children of the Leuites, Iozabed, and Semei, and Celaia, the same is Calita, Phataia, Iuda, and <sup>24</sup>Eliezer. And of the singing men Eliasib: and of the porters, <sup>25</sup>Sellum, and Thelem, and Vri. And of Israel, of the chil-dren of Pharos, Remeia, and Iezia, and Melchia, and Mia-<sup>26</sup>min, and Eliezer, and Melchia, and Banea. And of the chil-dren of Aelam, Mathania, Zacharias, and Iehiel, and Abdi, <sup>27</sup>and Ierimoth, and Elia. And of the children of Zethua, Elioenai, Eliasib, Mathania, Ierimuth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
