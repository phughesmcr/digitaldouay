him through with my speare in the earth once, and twise shal
not neede. <sup>9</sup> And Dauid said to Abisai: Kil him not: for
who shal extend his hand vpon the annointed of our Lord, &
shal be innocent? <sup>10</sup> And Dauid said: Our Lord liueth, vn-
lesse our Lord shal strike him, or his day come to die, or des-
cending into battel he perish: <sup>11</sup> Our Lord be merciful vnto me,
that I extend not my hand vpon the annointed of our Lord.
now therefore take the speare, which is at his head, & cuppe
of water, and let vs goe. <sup>12</sup> Dauid therefore tooke the speare,
and cuppe of water, which was at Saules head, and they went
away: and there was none that sawe, or vnderstood, or a-
waked, but al slept, because the dead sleepe :: of our Lord
had fallen vpon them. <sup>13</sup> And when Dauid had passed ouer
against, and stood in the toppe of the mountaine farre of, and
a good space betwen them, <sup>14</sup> Dauid cried to the people, and
to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying: Wilt thou not answer
Abner? And Abner answering saye: Who art thou, that criest
and disquietest the king? <sup>15</sup> And Dauid sayd to Abner: Art not
thou a man? And who is like thee in Israel? why therefore hast
thou not kept thy lord the king? for one of the multitude
hath entered in to kil the king thy lord. <sup>16</sup> This thing is not
good, which you haue done: Our Lord liueth, you are the
children of death, which haue not kept your lord, the an-
nointed of our Lord. Now therefore behold where the kinges
speare is, & where the cup of water is, which was at his head.
<sup>17</sup> And Saul knew Dauids voice, and sayd: Is this thy voice,
my sonne Dauid? And Dauid sayd: My voice, my lord king,
<sup>18</sup> and he said: For what cause doth my lord persecute his
seruant? What haue I done: or what euil is there in my hand?
<sup>19</sup> Now therefore heare, I pray, my lord King, the wordes of
thy seruant: If our Lord stirre thee vp against me, let there
be odour of sacrifice: but if the sonnes of men, they are cur-
sed in the sight of our Lord, which haue cast me out this day,
that I should not dwel in the inheritance of our Lord, saying:
Goe, serue strange goddes. <sup>20</sup> And now let not my blood be
shed vpon the earth before our Lord: for the king of Israel
is come forth to seeke one flea, as the perdix is pursued in the
mountaines. <sup>21</sup> And Saul sayd: I haue sinned, returne my
sonne Dauid, for I wil no more doe thee euil, for that my life
hath bene precious in thyne eies to day: for it appeareth that
I haue done foolishly, and haue bene ignorant of very many
thinges.

[^1]: Dauids re-
solute, and of-
ten repeated,
that it is not
lawful for pri-
uate subiectes
to kil their
prince, no al-
though him
selfe was an-
nointed to suc
cede.

[^2]: Gods proui-
dence sent this
extraordinary
sleepe and in-
spired Dauid,
to doe this
fact, for more
iustification of
his innocen-
cie.
