with marble pillers. Beddes also of gold and siluer, were
placed in order vpon the floore paued with the emerauld, and
the touch stone: which payning adorned with meruelous
<sup>7</sup> varietie. And they that were inuited, dranke in golden cup-
pes, and the meates were brought in change of vessels. Wine
also plenteous and the best was set downe, as was worthie
<sup>8</sup> of a kings magnificence. Neither was there that com-
pelled them to drinke that would not, but as the king had
appointed, making ech of his princes ouerseer of euerie ta-
<sup>9</sup> ble, that euerie man might take what he would. Vasthi also
the queene made a feast for the wemen in the palace, where
<sup>10</sup> king Assuerus had accustomed to remayne. Therfore the
seuenth day, when the king was merier, and after very much
drinking was wel warmed with wine, he commanded Mau-
mam, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha,
and Zethar, and Charchas, the seuen eunuches, that ministred
<sup>11</sup> in his sight, that they should bring in queene Vasthi before
the king, the crowne set vpon her head, that he might shew
her beautie to al the peoples and princes: for she was exceeding
<sup>12</sup> beautiful. Who refused, and contemned to come at the
kings commandment, which he had commanded by the eu-
nuches. Wherupon the king being wrath, and chaffed with
<sup>13</sup> exceeding furie, asked the wisemen, which after the man-
ner of a king were alwayes present with him, and he did al
thinges by their counsel, which knew the lawes, and rightes
<sup>14</sup> of the elders: (and the chiefe and nearest him were, Charse-
na, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and
Marsana, and Mamuchan, seuen dukes of the Persians, and
of the Medes, which saw the face of the king, and were wont
<sup>15</sup> to sit first after him) to what sentence Vasthi the queene
should be subiect, that would not do Assuerus the kings com-
mandment, which he had commanded by the eunuches.
<sup>16</sup> And Mamuchan answered, the king hearing, and the prin-
ces: Queene Vasthi hath not only hurt the king, but also al
peoples, and princes, that are in al the prouinces of king
<sup>17</sup> Assuerus. For the word of the queene wil goe forth to al
wemen, that they wil contemne their husbands, and wil say:
King Assuerus commanded that the queene Vasthi should
<sup>18</sup> come in to him, and she would not. And by this example al
the wiues of the princes of the Persians and the Medes, wil
little esteeme the commandmentes of their husbandes:

[^1]: The end of immoderate feasting is commonly brabling. Here the king became furi- ous, and the queene was diuorsed from him.
