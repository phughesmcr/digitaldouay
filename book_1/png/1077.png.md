# Esther

<sup>4</sup>And in the third day she laid away the garments which she ware, & was clothed in her glorie. <sup>5</sup>And when she glistered in royal apparel, and had invocated God the ruler and saviour of al, she tooke two wayting maydes, <sup>6</sup>and vpon the one in deede she leaned, as it were for delicatenes and verie much tendernes not able to beare vp her bodie: <sup>7</sup>but the other of the maydes folowed her ladie, bearing vp her garmentes trayling on the ground. <sup>8</sup>But her self in al her countenance of colour like the rose, also with gratious and shining eies hid her mind ful of sorow, and exceding feare. <sup>9</sup>She therfore entring through al the doores in order, stood before the king, where he sate vpon the throne of his kingdom, clothed with royal garmentes, and glittering in gold, and precious stones, and he was terrible to behold. <sup>10</sup>And when he had lifted vp his face, and with burning eies had shewed the furie of his breast, the Queene fel downe; and her colour being changed into palenes, she rested her wearie head vpon her handmayde. <sup>11</sup>And God turned the kings spirit into mildnes, and in hast and fearing he lept out of the throne, and holding her vp in his armes, til she came to her self, spake her fayre with these wordes: <sup>12</sup>What ayleth thee Esther? I am thy brother, feare not. <sup>13</sup>Thou shalt not die: for this law is not made for thee, but for the common sorte. <sup>14</sup>Come neere ther-fore, and touch the scepter. <sup>15</sup>And when she held her peace, he tooke the golden rod, & put it vpon her necke, and kissed her and sayd: Why speakest thou not to me? <sup>16</sup>Who answered: I saw thee, my Lord, as an angel of God, and my hart was trubled for the feare of thy glorie. <sup>17</sup>For thou, my lord, art exceding maruelous, and thy face is ful of graces. <sup>18</sup>And when she spake, she fel downe agayne, and was almost in a sowne. <sup>19</sup>But the king was trubled, and al his seruantes did comfort her.
