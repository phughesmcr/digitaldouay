CHAP. XVIII.

*The third yeare of famine, Elias meeting the chief gouernour of Achabs house, hardly perswadeth him to tel Achab, that he is present. 17. Achab blameth Elias; but Elias freely answereth that not he, but Achab troubleth Israel. 19. By a miracle foure hundred and fiftie false prophetes are conuinced and are slaine. 41. Elias prayeth and it rayneth.*

Goe, and tel thy lord: Elias is here. <sup>9</sup> And he sayd: What haue I sinned, that thou deliuerest me thy seruant into the hand of Achab, that he may kil me? <sup>10</sup> Our Lord thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seeke thee: and al answering: He is not here: he adiured al kingdomes and nations, for that thou wast not found. <sup>11</sup> And now thou sayest to me: Goe, and tel thy lord: Elias is here. <sup>12</sup> And when I am departed from thee, the Spirit of our Lord wil carie thee into a place, that I know

<aside>:: Abdias ado- red Elias as the prophete of God, and a holie man not with ciuil ho- nour, for in the world Ab- dias was the greater person nor with di- uine honour, for that had benne idola- trie. It was therfore reli- gious honour, called dulia, due to spiri- tual excellen- cie of Gods seruantes.</aside>
