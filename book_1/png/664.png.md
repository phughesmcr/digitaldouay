<sup>3</sup>of the sonnes of Beniamin: for Beroth also was accounted in
Beniamin. And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and
were there strangers vntil that time. <sup>4</sup>And Ionathas the
sonne of Saul had a sonne lame in his feete: for he was fiue
yeares old, when the tydinges came of Saul and Ionathas
from Iezrahel. his nurse therefore taking him, fled: and when
she made hast to flee, he fel, and was made lame: and he was
called Miphiboseth. <sup>5</sup>Therefore the sonnes of Rhemmon
the Berothite, Rachab and Baana coming, entered into the
house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: who slept vpon his
bed at noone. <sup>6</sup>And they entered into the house secretly
taking eares of corne, and Rechab and Baana his brother,
stroke him in priuy partes and fled. <sup>7</sup>And when they were
entered into the house, he slept vpon his bed in a parler, and
striking they killed him: and taking away his head they went
by the way of the desert al night. <sup>8</sup>And brought the head of
Isboseth to Dauid into Hebron: and they said to the king: Be-
hold the head of Isboseth the sonne of Saul thine enemie
who sought thy life: and our Lord hath geuen my lord the
king this day reuenge of Saul, and of his seede. <sup>9</sup>But Dauid
answering Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sonnes of
Rhemmon the Berothite, and sayd to them: our Lord liueth,
which hath deliuered my soule out of al distresse. <sup>10</sup>For so much
as him that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought that
he told prosperous thinges, I apprehended, and slew him
in Siceleg, to whom I should haue geuen a reward for his ty-
dinges. <sup>11</sup>How much more now when wicked men haue slaine
an innocent man in his owne house, vpon his bed, shal I not
require his bloud of your hand, and take you away from the
earth? <sup>12</sup>Dauid therefore commanded his seruantes, and they
slew them: and cutting of their handes and feete, hanged them
ouer the poole in Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they
tooke, and buried in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.
