borne, and the night wherein it was sayd: A man is conceiued. <sup>4</sup> Be that day turned into darkenesse, God require it not from aboue, and let it not be lightened with-light. <sup>5</sup> Let darkenes, and the shadow of death obscure it, let a mist possesse it, and be it wrapped in bitternesse. <sup>6</sup> A darkesome hurle-wind possesse that night, be it not counted in the daies of the yeare, nor numbred in the monthes. <sup>7</sup> Be that night solitarie, nor prayse worthie. <sup>8</sup> Let them curse it which curse the day, which are readie to raise vp Leuiathan. <sup>9</sup> Let the starres be darkened with the mist therof: let it expect light and let it not see, neither the rysing of the appearing morning. <sup>10</sup> Because it shut not vp the doores of the wombe, that bare me, nor tooke away euils from myne eies. <sup>11</sup> Why died I not in the matrice, perished not forthwith being come forth of the wombe? <sup>12</sup> Why receiued vpon the knees? why nursed with the breastes? <sup>13</sup> For now sleping I should be quiet, and should rest in my sleepe: <sup>14</sup> With kinges and consules of the earth, which build themselues solitarie places: <sup>15</sup> Or with princes, that possesse gold, and replenish their houses with siluer: <sup>16</sup> Or as a thing vntimely borne that is hid I should not be, or as they that being conceiued haue not seene the light. <sup>17</sup> There the impious haue ceased from tumult, & there the wearied with strength haue rested. <sup>18</sup> And they sometime bound together without griefe, haue not heard the voyce of the exactor. <sup>19</sup> Litle and great are there, and the seruant free from his master. <sup>20</sup> Why is there light geuen to a miserable man, and life to them, that are in bitternesse of soule? <sup>21</sup> That expect death, and it cometh not, as they that dig vp treasure. <sup>22</sup> And they reioyce excedingly when they haue found the graue. <sup>23</sup> To a man whol life is hid, and God hath compassed him with darkenes? <sup>24</sup> Before I eate I sigh: and as it were ouerflowing waters so my roaring: <sup>25</sup> Because the feare which I feared, hath chanced to me: and that which I was afrayd of, hath happened. <sup>26</sup> haue I not dissembled? haue I not kept silence? haue I not beene at rest? and indignation is come vpon me.

CHAP. IIII.

*Eliphaz blameth Iob argueth of impatience, arguing therupon that he was not so perfect in vertue as he semed. 7 and therfore is now punished by God, who (as Eliphaz falsly supposeth,) afflicteth not innocent men. 12. Alleging for proofe an imaginarie vision.*

<aside>his grief before his friends to be so great, that in respect therof, he vtterly curseth al things as not made by God but adioyned to mans life, being the effect of sinne, euen from his conception and birth: wishing that what soeuer concurred to his longer afflictions in this life, and hindered his more spedie deliuerie from dangers and calamities had not bene, for he was now ner at rest as Gods goodnes should dispose of him</aside>
