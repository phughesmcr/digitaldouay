the Phase the fourteenth day of the second moneth. The
Priestes also and the Leuites at length being sanctified offe-
red holocaustes in the house of our Lord. And they stoode
in their order according to the disposition, & law of Moyses
the man of God: but the Priestes receiued the bloud to be
powred out of the handes of the Leuites, <sup>17</sup> because a great
multitude was not sanctified: & therfore the Leuites immo-
lated the Phase for them, that came not in time to be sancti-
fied to our Lord. <sup>18</sup> For a great part of the people of Ephraim,
and Manasses, and Issachar, and Zabulon, that had not bene
sanctified, did eate the Phase, not according to that which is
written: and Ezechias prayed for them, saying: Our good
Lord wil be merciful, <sup>19</sup> to al them, that in al their hart
seeke our Lord the God of their fathers: and wil not impute
it to them that they are not sanctified. <sup>20</sup> Whom our Lord
heard, and was pacified to the people. <sup>21</sup> And the children of
Israel, that were found in Ierusalem, made the solemnitie of
Azimes seuen daies in great ioy, praysing our Lord euerie
day. The Leuites also and the Priestes by instrumentes, that
agreed to their office. <sup>22</sup> And Ezechias spake to the hart of
al the Leuites, that had good vnderstanding concerning our
Lord: and they did eate during the seuen daies of the solem-
nitie, immolating victimes of pacifiques, and praysing our
Lord the God of their fathers. <sup>23</sup> And it pleased the whole mul-
titude to celebrate it other seuen daies: which also they
did with great ioy. <sup>24</sup> For Ezechias the king of Iuda had
geuen the multitude a thousand oxen, and seuen thousand
sheepe: but the princes had geuen the people oxen a thou-
sand, & sheepe ten thousand: there was sanctified therfore a
verie great multitude of Priestes. <sup>25</sup> And al the multitude of
Iuda was ful of mirth, as wel of the Priestes and Leuites, as of
al the assemblie, that came out of Israel; of the proselites also
of the land of Israel, and them that dwelt in Iuda. <sup>26</sup> And
there was made a great solemnitie in Ierusalem, such as had
not bene in that citie from the dayes of Salomon the sonne of
Dauid the king of Israel. <sup>27</sup> And the Priestes & the Leuites
rose vp blessing the people: & their voice was heard: and
their prayer came into the holie habitation of heauen.
