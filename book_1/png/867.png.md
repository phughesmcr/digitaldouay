<sup>12</sup> Seek ye his face always. Remember his marvelous things which he hath done: his signes, and the iudgementes of his mouth.

<sup>13</sup> The seede of Israel his servant: the children of Jacob his elect.

<sup>14</sup> He is the Lord our God: in al the earth are his iudgementes.

<sup>15</sup> Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded vnto a thousand generations.

<sup>16</sup> Which he covenanted with Abraham: and his othe with Isaac.

<sup>17</sup> And he appoynted it to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an ever lasting covenant:

<sup>18</sup> Saying: To thee wil I geve the Land of Chanaan: the corde of your inheritance.

<sup>19</sup> When they were few in number: smal and soiourners therof.

<sup>20</sup> And they passed from nation into nation: & from kingdom to an other people.

<sup>21</sup> He suffered not any man to calumniate them: but rebuked kinges for their sake.

<sup>22</sup> Touch not my annoynted: and vnto my prophetes be not malicious.

<sup>23</sup> Sing ye to our Lord al the earth: shew forth from day to day his saluation.

<sup>24</sup> Tel his glorie among the gentiles: among al peoles his mervelous workes.

<sup>25</sup> Because our Lord is great, and laudable excedingly: and terrible over al goddes.

<sup>26</sup> For al the goddes of the peoples, be idols: but our Lord made the heavens.

<sup>27</sup> Confession and magnificence before him: strength and ioy in his place.

<sup>28</sup> Bring to our Lord ye families of peoples: bring to our Lord glorie and impire.

<sup>29</sup> Geve our Lord glorie, to his name, elevate sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore our Lord in holie honour.

<sup>30</sup> Let al the earth be moved before his face: for he founded the world vnmoveable.

<sup>31</sup> Let the heavens be glad, & the earth reioyce: and let them say among the nations, Our Lord hath reigned.

<sup>32</sup> Let the sea thunder, and the fulnesse therof: let the fieldes reioyce, and al thinges that are in them.

<sup>33</sup> Then shal the trees of the forest prayse before our Lord: because he is come to iudge the earth.

<sup>34</sup> Confesse ye to our Lord, because he is good: because his mercie is for ever.

<sup>35</sup> And say ye: Save vs O God our saviour: and gather vs together, & deliver vs out of the nations, that we may confesse to thy holie name, and may reioyce in thy songes.

<sup>36</sup> Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel from eternitie vnto eternitie: and let al the people say: Amen, and hymne to God.

<sup>37</sup> He therefore leaft Asaph there before the Arke of the covenant of our Lord, and his brethren to minister in the presence of the
