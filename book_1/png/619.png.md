<sup>24</sup> and the fight reached as farre as Bethauen. And the men of Israel were ioyned among themselues in that day: and Saul adiured the people, saying: Cursed be the man, that shal eate bread vntil euening, til I be reuenged of myne enemies. And the whole people did eate no bread: <sup>25</sup> and al the common people of the land came into a forest, wherein was honie vpon the face of the field. <sup>26</sup> The people therefore entred into the forest, and there appeared dropping honie, and no man put his hand to his mouth. for the people feared the oath. <sup>27</sup> But Ionathas had not heard when his father adiured the people: and he put forth the tippe of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipped it into a honie combe: and he turned his hand to his mouth, and his eies were illuminated. <sup>28</sup> And one of the people answering, sayd: Thy father hath bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shal eate bread this day. (and the people was faynt) <sup>29</sup> And Ionathas sayd: My father hath trubled the land: your selues haue seene that myn eies are illuminated, because I haue tasted a litle of this honie: <sup>30</sup> how much more if the people had eaten of the praye of their enemies, which they found? had there not beene made a greater plague in the Philistijms? <sup>31</sup> They stroke therefore in that day the Philistijms from Machmas vnto Ailon. And the people was wearied excedingly: <sup>32</sup> and being turned to the praye tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, & slew them on the ground: and the people did eate with bloud. <sup>33</sup> And they told Saul saying that the people had sinned to our Lord, eating with bloud. Who sayd: You haue transgressed: Roule to me euen now a great stone. <sup>34</sup> And Saul sayd: Disperse your selues among the common people, and tel them that euerie man bring me his oxe and ramme, and kil ye them vpon this same, and eate, and you shal not sinne to our Lord eating with bloud. Al the people therefore brought euerie man his oxe in his hand vntil night: and slew them there. <sup>35</sup> And Saul built an altar to our Lord; and then first did he beginne to build an altar to our Lord. <sup>36</sup> And Saul sayd: Let vs fal vpon the Philistijms by night, and spoyle them til it waxe light in the morning, neither let vs leaue a man of them. And the people sayd: Doe al that semeth good in thyne eies. And the priest sayd: Let vs approch hither to God. <sup>37</sup> And Saul consulted our Lord: Shal I pursue the Philistijms? wilt thou deliuer them into the handes of Israel?

<aside>Ionathas was excused by ignorance, & by necessitie: and therefore was iustly deliuered by the people; and his father offended, in not excepting the case of necessitie, & through more egre zele of reuenge, then he had warrant from, God, whose answer he would not expect. v. 19.</aside>

<aside>Where of so lowed also an other sinne, that the people fainting for lacke of meate did eate flesh with the blood, contrarie to the law.</aside>
