Lord your God, which brought you out of the Land of Ægypt
in great strength, and a streched out arme, him feare ye, and

he wrote you, kepe ye, that you may doe them alwaies: and

† but feare our Lord your God, and he wil deliuer you out of
<sup>40</sup> the hand of al your enemies. † But they heard not, but did

were fearing of our Lord but neuerthelesse seruing their idols
also: for both their children and nephewes, as their fathers did,
soe doe they vntil this present day.

CHAP. XVIII.

*Ezechias destroyeth al places of idolatrie in Iuda, breaking also the brasen serpent, made by Moyses, because the people offered incense to it. 9. The captiuitie of the ten tribes is repeted. 13. Ezechias not able to resist the Assyrians payeth much money to them. 17. They neuerthelesse send forces against Ierusalem, reproch the king, blaspheme God, and terrifie the people.*

he did that which was good before our Lord, according
<sup>4</sup> to al thinges which Dauid his father had done. † He de-
stroyed the excelses, and brake the statues in peeces, and
cut downe the groues, and brake the brasen serpent, which
Moyses had made: for vntil that time the children of Israel
:: burnt incense to it: and he called the name thereof [^1] No-
<sup>5</sup> hestan. † He trusted in our Lord the God of Israel: therfore

of Iuda, yea neither among them that were before him:
<sup>6</sup> † and he cleaued to our Lord, and departed not from his
steppes, and he did his commandmentes, which our Lord
<sup>7</sup> commanded Moyses. † Wherfore our Lord also was with
him, and in al things, to the which he proceded, he behaued
himselfe wisely. He rebelled also agaynst the king of the
Assyrians
