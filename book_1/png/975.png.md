Artaxerxes, <sup>13</sup>Esdras the Priest, the most learned scribe of the law of God of heauen, greeting. It is decreed by me that whosoeuer it shal please in my kingdom of the people of Israel, and of the Priestes and Leuites, to goe into Ierusalem, let him goe with thee. <sup>14</sup>For thou art sent from the face of the king, and of his seuen counselers, that thou mayst visite Iewrie and Ierusalem in the law of thy God, which is in thy hand. <sup>15</sup>And that thou maist carie the siluer & gold, which the king & his counselers haue voluntarily offered to the God of Israel, whose tabernacle is in Ierusalem. <sup>16</sup>And al the siluer and gold whatsoeuer thou shalt finde in al the prouince of Babylon, and the people wil offer, and of the Priestes that shal voluntarely offer to the house of theyr God, which is in Ierusalem, <sup>17</sup>take freely, and bye diligently of this money calues, rammes, lambes; and the sacrifices and libamentes of them, and offer them vpon the altar of the temple of your God, that is in Ierusalem. <sup>18</sup>Yea and if it shal please thee, and thy brethren to doe any thing with the rest of the siluer and gold, doe ye according to the wil of your God. <sup>19</sup>The vessels also, which are geuen thee for the ministerie of the house of thy God, deliuer thou in the sight of God in Ierusalem. <sup>20</sup>Yea and other thinges wherof neede shal be for the house of thy God, how much soeuer is necessarie for thee to spend, thou shalt geue it out of the treasure, and excheker of the king, and from me. <sup>21</sup>I Artaxerxes the king haue appointed and decreed to al the keepers of the common coffer, that are beyond the Riuer, that whatsoeuer Esdras the Priest, the scribe of the law of God of heauen, shal aske of you, you geue it without delay, <sup>22</sup>vnto an hundred talentes of siluer, and vnto an hundred cores of wheat, and vnto an hundred bates of wyne, and vnto an hundred bates of oyle, but salt without measure. <sup>23</sup>Al that pertayneth to the rite of the God of heauen, let it be geuen diligently in the house of the God of heauen: lest perhaps he be angrie agaynst the kingdom of the king, and of his sonnes. <sup>24</sup>We doe you also to vnderstand concerning al the Priestes, and Leuites, and the singers, and the porters, the Nathineitcs, and ministers of the house of this God, that you haue no authoritie to put tolle and tribute, and yearlie rentes vpon them. <sup>25</sup>And thou Esdras according to the wisedom of thy God, which is in thy hand, appoynt iudges and presidentes, that they may iudge for al the people, that is beyond the Riuer,
