man casting stones: and they stopt vp al the fountaines of
waters: and cut downe al trees that bare fruite, so that there
remained onlie brike walles: and the citie was besette of the
slingers, and for a great part thereof was strooken. <sup>26</sup> Which
when the king of Moab had seene, to witte, that the enemies
had preuayled, he tooke with him seuen hundred men that
drew sword, to breake in vpon the king of Edom: and they
could not. <sup>27</sup> And taking his first begotten sonne, that should
haue reigned for him, he offered him an holocaust vpon the
wal: and there was great indignation in Israel, and forthwith
they retyred from him, and returned into their countrie.

CHAP. III.

*Eliseus so multiplieth a poore widowes oyle, that she payeth her debtes and li-
ueth of the rest. 8. By his prayers a Sunamite woman hath a sonne. 18. Which
dying he rayseth to life. 38. He taketh away the bitternes of colocynthida,
which by chance was put in the potte, 42. and feedeth manie with few

borrow of al thy neighbours emptie vessels not a few. <sup>4</sup> And
goe in, and shut thy doore, when thou art within, thou and
thy sonnes: and powre therof into al these vessels: and when
they shal be ful, thou shalt take them away. <sup>5</sup> The woman

when the vessels were ful, she sayd to her sonne: Bring me

and Eliseus passed by Sunam: and there was there a great
