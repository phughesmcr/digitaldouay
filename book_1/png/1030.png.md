# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF IVDITH.

S. Ierom sometimes supposed this booke, not to be canonical, but afterwarde finding that the Councel of Nice accounted it in the number of holie Scriptures, *he so estemed it*; *and thervpon not only translated it into Latin, out of the Chaldetonque, wherin it was first written, but also as occasion required, alleaged the same as diuine Scripture, and sufficient to conuince matters of faith in controuersie.

And in this Preface doubted not to say: that the rewarder of Iudithes chastitie (God him self) gaue her for imitation not only to wemen, but also to men: gaue her such vertue that she ouerthrew him, whom none could ouercome, and conquered the inuincible. Also Before the Councel, Origen in c. 14. Iudith, Tertullian de Monogamia. c. 71r. And diuers*
