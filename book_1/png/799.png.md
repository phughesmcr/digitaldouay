Iehu is anointed king of Israel, 7. to destroy the house of Achab and Iezabel. 14. He presently killeth Ioram king of Israel, 27. Likewise Ochozias king of Iuda, 30. also Iezabel, who is eaten by dogges.

<sup>1</sup> AND Eliseus the prophete called one of the children of the prophetes, and sayd to him: Girde thy loynes, and take this litle boxe of oyle in thy hand, and goe into Ramoth Galaad. <sup>2</sup> And when thou shalt come thither, thou shalt see Iehu the sonne of Iosaphat the sonne of Namsi: and going in thou shalt rayse him out of the middes of his brethren, and shalt bring him into an inner chamber. <sup>3</sup> And holding the litle boxe of oyle, thou shalt powre vpon his head, and shalt say: Thus sayth our Lord: I haue anoynted thee king ouer Israel. And thou shalt open the doore, and flee, and shalt not stay there. <sup>4</sup> The yongman therefore the childe of a prophete went into Ramoth Galaad, <sup>5</sup> and entered in thither: and behold the captaynes of the armie sate, and he sayd: I haue a word to thee o prince: And Iehu sayd: to whom of vs al? But he sayd: To thee o prince. <sup>6</sup> And he arose, and went into the chamber: but he powred oyle vpon his head, and sayd: Thus sayth our Lord the God of Israel: I haue anoynted thee king ouer the people of the Lord of Israel, <sup>7</sup> and thou shalt strike the house of Achab thy maister, and I wil reuenge the bloud of my seruantes the prophetes, and the bloud of al the seruantes of the Lord of the hand of Iezabel. <sup>8</sup> And I wil destroy al the house of Achab, and wil kil of Achab him that pisseth agaynst a wal, and the shut vp, and the meanest in Israel. <sup>9</sup> And I wil make the house of Achab, as the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the sonne of Ahias. <sup>10</sup> Iezabel also the dogges shal eate in the field of Iezrahel, neither shal there be anie to burie her. And he opened the doore, and fled. <sup>11</sup> And Iehu went forth to his maisters seruantes. Who said to him: Are al thinges wel? Why came this madde man to thee? Who sayd to them: You know the man, and what he spake. <sup>12</sup> But they answered: It is false, but rather doe thou tel vs. Who sayd to them: Thus and thus he spake to me: and he sayd: Thus sayth our Lord, I haue anoynted thee king ouer Israel. <sup>13</sup> They therefore made hast, and euerie man taking his mantel layd it vnder his feete, after the similitude of a iudgement seate, & they sounded the trumpet,
