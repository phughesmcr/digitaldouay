# CHAP. XXI.

Iob requiring his freindes to heare him, <sup>7</sup> discourseth of the cause, why some euil men prosper al their life.

<sup>1</sup> But Iob answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup> Heare I beseech you my wordes, and doe penance. <sup>3</sup> Beare with me, that I also may speake, and after my wordes, if it shal seme good, laugh ye. <sup>4</sup> Is my disputation agaynst man, that I ought not worthely to be sorowful? <sup>5</sup> Harken to me, and be astonied, and put the finger vpon your mouth. <sup>6</sup> And I when I shal remember, am afrayd, and trembling shaketh my flesh. <sup>7</sup> Why then doe the impious liue, are they aduanced, and strengthened with riches? <sup>8</sup> Their seede continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and o nephewes in their sight <sup>9</sup> Their houses be secure and peaceable, & the rod of God is not vpon them. <sup>10</sup> Their bullock hath conceiued, and hath not made abortiue: their cow hath calued, and is not depriued of her calfe. <sup>11</sup> Their litle ones goe for th as flockes, and their infantes reioyce with pastimes. <sup>12</sup> They hold the timbrel, & the harpe, & reioyce at the sound of the organe. <sup>13</sup> They lead their daies in wealth, and in a moment they goe downe to hel. <sup>14</sup> Who sayd to God: depart from vs, we wil not the knowlege of thy waies. <sup>15</sup> Who is the Omnipotent, that we should serue him? and what doth it profite vs if we shal pray him? <sup>16</sup> But yet because their good things are not in their hand, be the counsel of the impious far from me. <sup>17</sup> How often shal the candel of the impious be extinguished, and inundation come vpon them, and shal he deuide the sorowes of his furie? <sup>18</sup> They shal be as chaffe before the face of the winde, and as ashes, which the whirlewinde scattereth. <sup>19</sup> God shal reserue the sorow of the father to his children: and when he shal haue rendred it, then shal he know <sup>20</sup> His eies shal see his owne slaughter, and he shal drinke the furie of the Omnipotent. <sup>21</sup> For what doeth it pertayne to him concerning his house after him: although the number of his monethes be diminished the halfe? <sup>22</sup> Shal anie man teach God knowledge, who iudgeth the high ones. <sup>23</sup> This man dieth strong and in health, rich and happie. <sup>24</sup> His vowels be ful of fatte, and his bones be imbrewed with marrow. <sup>25</sup> But an other dieth in bitternesse of soule without anie riches: <sup>26</sup> And yet they shal sleepe together in the dust, and wormes shal couer them. <sup>27</sup> Surely I know
