<sup>8</sup> She therefore wrote letters in the name of Achab, and signed them with his ring, and sent to the ancientes, and the chiefe men that were in his citie, and dwelt with Naboth.

<sup>9</sup> And this was the tenor of the letters: Proclame a fast, and make Naboth sitte among the chiefe of the people, <sup>10</sup> and suborne two men the children of Belial agaynst him, and let them beare false testimony: that he hath blessed God and the king: and bring him forth, and stone him, and so let him die.

<sup>11</sup> His citizens therefore the ancientes and chiefe men, that dwelt with him in the citie, did as Iezabel had commanded them, and as it was written in the letters which she sent to them: <sup>12</sup> they proclamed a fast, and made Naboth sitte among the chiefe of the people. <sup>13</sup> And two men the children of the diuel being brought forth, they made them sitte agaynst him: but they, as diuelish men, gaue testimonie agaynst him before the multitude: Naboth hath blessed God and the king: for the which thing they brought him forth without the citie, and killed him with stones. <sup>14</sup> And they sent to Iezabel, saying: Naboth is stoned, and is dead. <sup>15</sup> And it came to passe, when Iezabel had heard that Naboth was stoned, and dead, she spake to Achab: Arise, and possesse the vineyard of Naboth the Iezrahelite, who would not agree vnto thee, and geue it taking money: for Naboth liueth not, but is dead. <sup>16</sup> Which when Achab had heard, to witte, that Naboth was dead, he arose, & went downe into the vineyard of Naboth the Iezrahelite, to possesse it.

<sup>17</sup> The word of our Lord therefore came to Elias the Thesbite, saying: <sup>18</sup> Arise, and goe downe to meete Achab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold he goeth downe to the vineyard of Naboth, to possesse it: <sup>19</sup> and thou shalt speake to him, saying: Thus sayth our Lord: Thou hast slayne, moreouer also thou hast possest. And after these wordes thou shalt adde: Thus sayth our Lord: In this place, wherein the dogges haue licked the bloud of Naboth, they shal licke thy bloud also. <sup>20</sup> And Achab sayd to Elias: Hast thou found me thyne enemie? Who sayd: I haue found thee, for that thou art sold, to doe euil in the sight of our Lord. <sup>21</sup> Behold I wil bring euil vpon thee, and wil cut downe thy posteritie, and wil kil of Achab him that pisseth agaynst the wal, and the inclosed, and the last in Israel. <sup>22</sup> And I wil make thy house, as the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the sonne of
