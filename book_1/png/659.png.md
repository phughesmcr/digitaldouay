<sup>1</sup>Therefore after these thinges Dauid consulted
our Lord, saying: Shal I goe vp into one of the cities of
Iuda? And our Lord said to him: Goe vp. And Dauid said:
Whither shal I goe vp? And he answered him: Into Hebron.
<sup>2</sup>Dauid therefore went vp, and his two wiues, Achinoam the
Iezrahelite, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel: <sup>3</sup>yea
and the men also that were with him, Dauid brought euery
one with his houshold: and they abode in the townes of He-
bron. <sup>4</sup>And the men of Iuda came, and annoynted Da-
uid there, to reigne ouer the house of Iuda. And it was told
Dauid, that the men of Iabes Galaad had buried Saul. <sup>5</sup>Da-
uid therefore sent messengers vnto the men of Iabes Galaad,
and sayd vnto them: Blessed be you to our Lord, which haue
done this mercie with your lord Saul, and haue buried him.
<sup>6</sup>And now our Lord certes wil render you mercie and truth:
but I also wil requite you the good turne, for that you haue
done this thing. <sup>7</sup>Let your handes be strengthned, and be
yee stout men: for although your lord Saul be dead, yet the
house of Iuda hath annointed me to be their king. <sup>8</sup>But
Abner the sonne of Ner prince of Sauls armie, tooke Isbo-
seth the sonne of Saul, & led him about through the campe,
<sup>9</sup>and ordained him king ouer Galaad, and ouer Gessuri,
and ouer Iezrahel, & ouer Ephraim, and ouer Beniamin, and
ouer al Israel. <sup>10</sup>Fourtie yeares old was Isboseth the sonne
of Saul when he began to reigne ouer Israel, and he reigned
two yeares: and only the house of Iuda folowed Dauid.
<sup>11</sup>And the number of the daies, that Dauid abode, reigning
in Hebron ouer the house of Iuda, was seuen yeares and six
monethes. <sup>12</sup>And Abner the sonne of Ner went forth, and
the seruantes of Isboseth the sonne of Saul, out of the campe
into Gabion. <sup>13</sup>Moreouer Ioab the sonne of Saruia, and
the seruants of Dauid went forth, and mette them beside
the poole of Gabaon, and when they were come together
into one place, they sate one ouer against an other: these
on the one side of the poole, and they on the other. <sup>14</sup>And
Abner said to Ioab: Let the yong men rise, and play before
vs. And Ioab answered: Let them rise. <sup>15</sup>There rose there-
fore and passed twelue in number, of Beniamin, of Isbo-
seths part the sonne of Saul, and twelue of the seruantes of
Dauid. <sup>16</sup>And euery one taking the head of his mate, sticked his
sword into the side of his aduersarie, and they fel together:

<aside>This second annointing, as also the third, {ch. 5.} was in confirmation and to put him in possession of the state made long before. 1. K'g. 16.</aside>

<aside>He reigned two yeares be- fore he be- ganne much to decline, but in al seuen yea- res and a half, for so long Da uid reigned only in Iuda.</aside>

<aside>Hence per- haps cometh the phrase, that one armis playeth vpon an other, and great cru- eltie.</aside>
