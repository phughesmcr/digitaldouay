therefore going out from the face of our Lord, stroke Iob with
a verie sore boile, from the sole of the foote euen to the toppe
of his head: <sup>8</sup> who with a shel scraped the corruption, sitting
on a dunghil. <sup>9</sup> And his wife sayd to him: Doest thou yet
continue in thy simplicitie? blesse God and die. <sup>10</sup> Who sayd to
her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish wemen, if we
haue receiued good things of the hand of God, euil things
why should we not receiue? In al these things Iob sinned not
with his lippes. <sup>11</sup> Therefore Iobs three frendes hearing al
the euil, that had changed to him, came euerie one out of their
place, Eliphaz a Themanite, and Baldad a Suhite, and Sophar
a Naamathite. For they had appointed, that coming toge-
ther they would visite him, and confort him. <sup>12</sup> And when
they had lifted vp their eies a far of, they knew him not, and
crying out they wept, and renting their clothes sprinkled dust
ouer their head toward heauen. <sup>13</sup> And they sate with him on
the ground seuen daies and seuen nightes, and no man spake
to him a word: for they saw the payne to be vehement.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. II.

[^1] *Iobs three frendes*] For better intelligence of these confictes betwen
holie Iob and his freindes, it may here be obserued, that they were in dede his
freindes, as the text simply calleth them: that they beleued rightly in God
Almightie, and were not idolaters: that they came of freindly compassion
to comfort him in his great miserie, and of visiting him, [^2] as S. Gregorie tea-
cheth they alleaged also manie excellent diuine sentences very truly, which
therfore Iob reproued not. But they erred in their illations against Iob: and
that of ignorance rather then of sette malice, concluding that Iob was guiltie
of some enormious sinnes, because they saw him so grevously punished, and
heard him complaine therof, his owne conscience knowes to him and hid to
them (whereof they rashly iudged) testifying that he was innocent, in respect
of so great crimes. And in this their particular error, though they were not
heretikes, being not obstinate after that the truth was sufficiently reueled
vnto them, yet they presumed heretikes, endeuouring by one truth to de-
stroy an other, and by auouching knowledge which they had not: presuming also
very things & vnheard of, rather to avow their owne adsertion, then to edification.

CHAP. III.

*Iob lamenteth, describing his owne, and the general calamities of men,
13. and shewing how escape manie miseries which either are neuer borne
or die presently after their birth.*

<aside>His wife perswading him to desperation and blasphemie, signified carnal cogitions which corrupt the soule inwardly, as afflictions do assault the flesh outward ly S. Greg. li. 3. c. 14.</aside>

<aside>Seuen dayes together euerie day and night some good part.</aside>

<aside>These visiters of Iob were in dede his freindes, and professed true religion. They erred in Iobs particu lar case.</aside>

<aside>And presumed heretikes.</aside>

<aside>After so long silence at last Iob expresseth</aside>

AFter these things Iob opened his mouth, and <sup>1</sup> cursed
his day, <sup>2</sup> and spake. <sup>3</sup> Perish may the day wherin I was
