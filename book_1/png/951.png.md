the Priestes they prepared afterward : for in oblation of
holocaustes and of fatte the Priestes were occupied vntil
night: wherfore the Leuites prepared for themselues, and
for the Priestes the children of Aaron last. <sup>15</sup> Moreouer the
singing men the children of Asaph stood in their order, ac-
cording to the precept of Dauid, and Asaph, and Heman, and
Idithun the prophetes of the king : and the porters watched
at euerie gate, so that they departed not a moment from the
ministerie: for the which cause also their brethren the Leui-
tes prepared meates for them. <sup>16</sup> Therfore al the seruice of
our Lord was ritely accomplished that day, so that they made
the Phase, and offered holocaustes vpon the altar of our Lord,
according to the precept of king Iosias. <sup>17</sup> And the children
of Israel that were found there, made the Phase at that time,
<sup>18</sup> and the solemnitie of Azymes seuen daies. <sup>19</sup> There was not
a Phase like to this in Israel, from the daies of Samuel the
prophete: neither did anie of al the kinges of Israel make a
Phase as Iosias, to the Priestes, and the Leuites, and to al Iuda,
and Israel that was found, and to the inhabitantes of Ierusa-
lem. <sup>20</sup> In the eightenth yeare of the kingdom of Iosias was
this Phase celebrated. <sup>21</sup> After that Iosias had repayred the
temple, came vp Nechao the king of Ægypt to fight in Char-
camis beside Euphrates: and Iosias went forth to meete him.
<sup>22</sup> But he sending messengers vnto him, sayd: What haue I to
doe with thee king of Iuda? I come not agaynst thee this day,
but I fight agaynst an other house, to the which God hath
commanded me to goe in hast: leaue to doe agaynst God, who
is with me, lest he kil thee. <sup>23</sup> Iosias would not returne, but
prepared battel agaynst him, neither did he agree to the wor-
des of Nechao from the mouth of God, but went forward to
fight in the fielde of Mageddo. <sup>24</sup> And there being wounded
of the Archers, he sayd to his seruantes: Carie me out of the
battel, because I am sore wounded. <sup>25</sup> Who remoued him
from one chariote into an other chariote, that folowed him
after the maner of kinges, and they caried him away into Ie-
rusalem, & he died, and was buried in the monument of his
fathers, and al Iuda and Ierusalem mourned for him. <sup>26</sup> Ie-
remie most of al: whose lamentations al the singing men and
singing women repeate vntil this present day vpon Iosias,
and it is growen as it were a law in Israel : Behold it is sayd
to be writen in the lamentations. <sup>27</sup> But the rest of the wordes
