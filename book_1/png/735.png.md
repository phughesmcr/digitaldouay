OF KINGES.

<sup>715</sup>as prouided by the law. For first al were strictly commanded, not to communicate with infidels in their idolatrie (Ex. 23.) nor with schismatikes in their schisme (Nu. 16.) but to destroy al Idolaters (Num. 33.) and shunne al nouelties in religion, as a sure marke of idolatrie, or false doctrine (Deut. 13.) Further to conserue vnitie there was but one Tabernacle, and one Altar for Sacrifice, in the whole people of Israel. Wherupon when the two tribes and halfe, on the other side Iordan, had made a seueral altar, al the tribes that dwelt in Chanaan, suspecting it was for sacrifice, sent presently to admonish them, and prepared to make warre against them, except they destroied their new altar, but being aduertised that it was only an altar of monument, and not for sacrifice, were therewith satisfied. (Iosue. 22.) Afterwards the tribe of Dan, setting vp idolatrie, and the other tribes not correcting it, they were al punished. Which happened by occasion of an other enormous sinne, committed and not corrected in the tribe of Beniamin. For the other eleuen tribes making warre against them for this iust cause, yet by Gods direction, and warrant, yet had the worse, susteyning great slaughter of men in two conflictes; and in the third Beniamin was almost destroied. Iudic. 20. Finally for decision of al controuersies and ending of suites, the High Priest was expressly ordayned supreme Iudge. (Deut. 17.) And al were commanded in paine of death to submitte their opinions, and obey his sentence: with promise of Gods assistance, wherby his definitions were certaine and infallible. For in consultation of doubtes, and difficult cases, God inspired him with doctrine of veritie (Exod. 28. 29. Leuit. 8. Num. 3. 7. 9. 1. Reg. 23, 30.) Which iudgement seate Christ admonished the Iewes to obserue and folow (Math. 23.) though the Iudges themselues did not the thinges which they taught. In so much that Caiphas, through this assistance of Gods spirit, being otherwise a wicked man, yet pronounced the truth, That one must die for the people. Which therfore S. Iohn the Euangelist ascribeth to his Charge and office, because he was High priest that yeare. Ioan. 11.

Seing then Gods prouidence and continual assistance was so clere, and assured in the Church of the old Testament, much more is the Church of Christ builded vpon a sure rocke, assured of his perpetual assistance, and alwayes preserued from erring in Faith, or in general practise of Religion. And that by Gods like assured ordinance of one supreme head and Iudge, S. Peter, & his Successour: for whom our Sauiour praied, that his faith should not faile. Further commanding him, that he should confirme his brethren. Al which we see is performed in the successours of S. Peter, wheras the successours of the other Apostles, are al failed long since. The same most assured stabilitie of the Church of Christ, is further confirmed by the whole Law and Prophetes. Namely, Deut. 32. and 33. where Moyses foretelleth more power and grace in the Church, to be collected in the
