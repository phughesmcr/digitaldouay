Samuel.Saul.

<sup>22</sup> And when the day was come to fight, there was not found sword and speare in the hand of al the people, that was with Saul and Ionathas, except Saul and Ionathas his sonne. <sup>23</sup> And the station of the Philistijms went forth, to passe vp into Machmas.

CHAP. XIIII.

*Ionathas trusting in God, accompanied with one man, his father not knowing, goeth into the Philisthijms campe; killeth twentie men and troubleth their whole armie. 16. Saul vnderstanding the same, apprehendeth with his armie, and they gette a great victorie. 24.

But the people oppose themselues, and deliuer him from death. 47. Saul prospereth in his kingdom, with his familie.*
