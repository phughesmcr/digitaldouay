<sup>12</sup> Surely doth he not consider? A vaine man is extolled into pride, contrarie, and thinketh him self borne free as a wilde asses colt. <sup>13</sup> But thou hast confirmed thy hart, & hast spred thy handes to him. <sup>14</sup> If thou shalt take away from thee the iniquitie that is in thy hand, and iniustice remaine not in thy tabernacle: <sup>15</sup> Then mayst thou lift vp thy face without spotte, and thou shalt be stable, and shalt not feare. <sup>16</sup> Thou shalt also forget mise- rie, and shalt remember it as waters that are passed. <sup>17</sup> And the brightnes as it were of noone daies, shal arise to thee at euening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day starre. <sup>18</sup> And thou shalt haue confidence, hope being set before thee, and buried thou shalt sleepe se- cure. <sup>19</sup> Thou shalt rest, and there shal be none to terrifie thee: and verie manie shal beseech thy face. <sup>20</sup> But the eies of the impious shal decay, and escape shal faile them, and their hope the abomination of the soule.

CHAP. XII.

*Iob sheweth the knowledge, which his freinds much boast of, to be the com- mon knowne doctrin of Gods seruantes. He more truly, and more pro- foundly discourseth of Gods powre and wisdome, stil defending his owne innocencie in respect of great sinnes.*

<sup>1</sup> BVt Iob answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup> Are you then men alone, & shal wisedome die with you? <sup>3</sup> I also haue a hart euen as you, neither am I inferiour to you: for who is ignorant of these thin- ges, which you know? <sup>4</sup> He that is mocked of his frend as I, shal inuocate God & he wil heare him: for the simplicitie of the iust man is scorned. <sup>5</sup> The lampe contemned in the cogi- tations of the riche, is prepared to the time appointed. <sup>6</sup> The tabernacles of robbers abound, & they prouoke God bouldly, wheras he hath geuen al thinges into their handes. <sup>7</sup> For aske the beastes, and they shal teach thee: and the foules of the ayre, and they shal tel thee. <sup>8</sup> Speake to the earth, and it shal answer thee, and the fishes of the sea shal tel. <sup>9</sup> Who is igno- rant that the hand of our Lord hath made al these things? <sup>10</sup> In whose hand is the soule of euerie liuing thing, and the spirit of al the flesh of man. <sup>11</sup> Doth not the eare discerne wordes, and the iawes of him that eateth, the tast? <sup>12</sup> In the ancientes is wisdom, and in long time prudence. <sup>13</sup> With him is wise- dom and strength, he hath counsel and vnderstanding. <sup>14</sup> If he shut vp a man,

[^1]: He could not iustly con- fesse iniquitie which he had not c√µmitted.

[^2]: God suffe- reth his sim- ple true mea- ning (seruan- tes to be scor- ned for the time, but af- terward the wicked shal be forced to confesse, that those whom they derided are worthly in honour be- fore God. sap. 5. v. 3.
