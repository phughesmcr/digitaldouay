<sup>1</sup>Twenty yeares old was Achaz when he began to reigne, & he reigned sixtene yeares in Ierusalem: he did not right in the sight of our Lord as Dauid his father, <sup>2</sup>but walked in the wayes of the kinges of Israel, moreouer also he did cast statues to Baalim. <sup>3</sup>He it is that burnt incense in the Vale benennom, and he consecrated his sonnes in fire according to the rite of the nations, which our Lord slew in the coming of the children of Israel. <sup>4</sup>He sacrificed also, & burnt incense in the excelses, & on hilles, and vnder euerie tree ful of grene leaues. <sup>5</sup>And our Lord his God deliuered him into the handes of the king of Syria, who stroke him, and tooke a great praye out of his kingdom, & brought into Damascus: to the handes also of the king of Israel was he deliuered, and striken with a great plague. <sup>6</sup>And Phacee the sonne of Romelia slew of Iuda an hundred twentie thousand in one day, al men of warre: for that they had forsaken our Lord the God of their fathers. <sup>7</sup>At that time Zechri a mightie man of Ephraim, slew Maasias the kinges sonne, and Ezricam the gouernour of his house, Elcana also second from the king. <sup>8</sup>And the children of Israel tooke of their brethren two hundred thousand of women, of boyes, and of wenches, and an infinite praye: and they brought it into Samaria. <sup>9</sup>At that time there was a Prophete of our Lord, named Oded: who going forth to meete the armie coming into Samaria, sayd to them: Behold our Lord the God of your fathers being angrie against Iuda, hath deliuered them into your handes, and you haue slayne them cruelly, so that your crueltie did reach to heauen. <sup>10</sup>Moreouer the children of Iuda and Ierusalem you wil subdue vnto you for bondmen and bondwomen, which nedeth not to be done: for you haue sinned hereupon to our Lord your God. <sup>11</sup>But heare ye my counsel, and carie backe the captiues, that you haue brought of your brethren, because the great furie of our Lord hangeth ouer you. <sup>12</sup>There stood therefore princes of the children of Ephraim, Azarias the sonne of Iohanan, Barachias the sonne of Mosollomoth, Ezechias the sonne of Sellum, and Amasa the sonne of Hadali, against them that came out of the battel, <sup>13</sup>and they sayd to them: You shal not bring in the captiues hither, lest we sinne to our Lord. Why wil you adde vpon our sinnes, and heape vp old offences? for it is a great sinne, and the anger of the furie of our Lord hangeth ouer Israel.
