THE BOOKE

hast wrought iniquitie: Remember that thou knowest not <sup>24</sup> his worke, wherof men haue song. <sup>25</sup> Al men see him, euerie <sup>26</sup> one beholdeth far of. Behold, God is great surmounting our knowledge: the number of his yeares is inestimable. <sup>27</sup> Who taketh away the droppes of raine, and powreth out <sup>28</sup> showers as it were gulfes of water. <sup>29</sup> Which flow out from the clowdes, that couer al thinges from aboue. <sup>30</sup> If he wil stretch forth clowdes as his tent. <sup>31</sup> And lighten with his light from aboue, he shal couer also the endes of the sea. <sup>32</sup> For by these he iudgeth peoples, and geueth victuals to manie mortal men. <sup>33</sup> In his handes he hideth the light, and commandeth it that it come agayne. He sheweth his freind therof, that it is his possession, and that he may ascend to it.

VPON this my hart is sore afrayd, and is moued out of <sup>1</sup> his place. <sup>2</sup> Heare ye his speach in the terrour of his voice, and the sound proceding out of his mouth. <sup>3</sup> Vnder al the heauens he considereth, and his light is vpon the endes of the earth. <sup>4</sup> After him shal sounding roare, he shal thunder with the voice of his greatnes, & shal not be found out when his voice shal be heard. <sup>5</sup> God shal thunder in his voice meruelously, he that doeth great & vnsearcheable thinges. <sup>6</sup> He that commandeth the snow to descend vpon the earth, and the winter raines, and the shower of his strength. <sup>7</sup> He that signeth in the hand of al men, that euerie one may know his workes. <sup>8</sup> The beast shal enter into his couert, and shal abide in his denne. <sup>9</sup> From the inner partes shal tempest come forth, and cold from Arcturus. <sup>10</sup> When God bloweth frost congeleth, and againe waters are powred most largely. <sup>11</sup> Corne desireth clowdes, and the clowdes spred their light <sup>12</sup> Which goe round about, whither soeuer the wil of the gouerner shal lead them, to al that he shal comand them vpon the face of the whole earth <sup>13</sup> Whether in one tribe, or in his land, or in what place soeuer of his mercie he shal command them to be found. <sup>14</sup> Harken to these things Iob: Stand, and consider the maruels of God. <sup>15</sup> Doest thou know when God commanded
