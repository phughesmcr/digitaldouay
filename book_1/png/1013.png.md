escape the commandment of death, and <sup>9</sup>doest thou burie the dead agayne? But Tobias more fearing God, then the king, in hast tooke the bodies of them that were slayne, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them. <sup>10</sup>And it happened that on a certayne day, being wearied with burying, coming into his house he had cast himself downe by the wal, and slept, <sup>11</sup>and as he was sleeping, hote dung out of the swallowes nest fel vpon his eyes, and he was made blinde. <sup>12</sup>And this tentation therfore our Lord permitted to chance vnto him, that an example might be geuen to posteritie of his patience, also of holie Iob. <sup>13</sup>For whereas he feared God alwaies from his infancie, and kept his commandmentes, he grudged not agaynst God for that the plague of blindnes had chanced to him, <sup>14</sup>but continewed immoueable in the feare <sup>15</sup>of God, geuing thankes to God al the dayes of his life. <sup>16</sup>For as the kinges insulted against blessed Iob: so his parentes and cosins derided his life, saying: <sup>17</sup>Where is thy hope, for the which thou didest bestowe almes and burials? <sup>18</sup>But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speake not so: <sup>19</sup>because we are the children of holie ones, and looke for that life, which God wil geue to them, that neuer change their faith from him. <sup>20</sup>But Anna his wife went dayly to weauing worke, and she brought the gaines of her handie labour, which she could <sup>21</sup>get. Whereby it came to passe, that she receiuing a kid of goates had brought it home: <sup>22</sup>the voice whereof bleating when her husband had heard, he sayd: Take heed, lest perhaps it be stollen, restore ye it to his owners, because it is not lawful for vs either to eate anie thing of theft or to touch it. <sup>23</sup>To these wordes his wife being angrie answered: Thy hope is become vayne manifestly, and thine almes now haue <sup>24</sup>appeared. <sup>25</sup>And with these, and other such like wordes she vpbrayded him.

CHAP. III.

*The prayer of Tobias, 7. and Sara, in their seueral afflictions, 24. are heard by God, and the Angel Raphael is sent to releeue them.*

<sup>1</sup>THEN Tobias lamented, and began to pray with teares, <sup>2</sup>saying: Thou art iust Ã´ Lord, & al thy iudgementes are iust, and al thy waies, mercie, & truth, and iudgement. <sup>3</sup>And now Lord be mindful of me, and take not reuenge of my sinnes, neither remember the sinnes of me, or of my parentes.
