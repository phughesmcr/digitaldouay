And he called the title by his name, and it is called The hand of Absalom, vntil this present day. <sup>19</sup> And Achimaas the sonne of Sadoc said: I wil runne, and tel the king, that our Lord hath done him iudgement of the hand of his enemies. <sup>20</sup> To whom Ioab said: Thou shalt not be messenger this day, but thou shalt carie the message an other day: to day I wil not haue thee carie the message, for the kinges sonne is dead. <sup>21</sup> And Ioab said to Chusai: Goe, and tel the king what thou hast seene.
