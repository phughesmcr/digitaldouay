# Achans sinne punished.

## CHAP. VII.

For the sinne of Achan, reseruing secretly to himself certaine money, and other precious thinges, the Israelites are beaten in battel. 14. But the offen-
der being found out, and stoned to death, Gods wrath is turned from them.

<sup>1</sup> BVT the children of Israel transgressed the command-
ment, & vsurped of the anathema. For Achan the sonne
of Charmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zare of the tribe
of Iuda, tooke somewhat of the anathema: and our Lord was
<sup>2</sup> angrie against the children of Israel. And when Iosue sent
from Iericho men against Hai, which is beside Bethauen,
at the East side of the towne of Bethel, he said to them: Goe
vp, and view the Land: who accomplishing his command-
<sup>3</sup> mentes, viewed Hai. And returning they said to him: Let
not al the people goe vp, but let two or three thousand men
goe, and destroy the citie: why shal al the people be vexed in
<sup>4</sup> vaine against verie few enemies? There went vp ther-
fore three thousand fighting men. Who immediatly turning
<sup>5</sup> their backes, were strooken of the men of the citie of
Hai, and there fel of them six and thirtie men: and the ad-
uersaries pursued them from the gate as farre as Sabarim,
and they stricke them flying away by the descent: and the
hart of the people was much afrayd, and melted like vnto
<sup>6</sup> water. But Iosue rent his garmentes, and fel flatte on the
ground before the arke of our Lord vntil euening, as wel he
as al the ancientes of Israel: and they cast dust vpon their
<sup>7</sup> heades, and Iosue said: Alas Ã´ Lord God, why wouldest
thou bring this people ouer the riuer of Iordan, to deliuer vs
into the handes of the Amorrheite, and to destroy vs, would
<sup>8</sup> God as we beganne, we had taried beyond Iordan. My Lord
God what shal I say, seeing Israel turning their backes to
<sup>9</sup> their enemies? The Chananeites shal heare of it, and al
the inhabitantes of the Land, and being gathered together
in a plumpe shal compasse vs about, & shal destroy our name
from the earth: and what wilt thou doe to thy greate name?
<sup>10</sup> And our Lord said to Iosue: Arise, why liest thou
<sup>11</sup> flatte on the ground? Israel hath sinned, and transgressed
my couenant: and they haue taken of the anathema, and
haue stolen and lyed, and haue hid it among their vessel.
<sup>12</sup> Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, and he shal
flee them: because he is polluted with the anathema. I wil
