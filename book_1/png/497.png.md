<sup>14</sup> That day our Lord magnified Iosue before al Israel, that they should feare him, as they had feared Moyses, whiles he yet liued. <sup>15</sup> And he said to him: <sup>16</sup> Command the priestes, that carie the arke of the couenant, that they come vp out of Iordan. <sup>17</sup> Who commanded them, <sup>18</sup> saying: Come ye vp out of Iordan. <sup>19</sup> And when they that caried the arke of the couenant of our Lord, were come vp, and began to treade on the drie ground, the waters returned into their chanel, and ranne as they were wont before. <sup>19</sup> And the people came vp out of Iordan, the tenth day of the first moneth, and camped in Galgal against the East side of the citie of Iericho. <sup>20</sup> The twelue stones also, which they had taken out of the chanel of Iordan, Iosue sette in Galgal, <sup>21</sup> and said to the children of Israel: When your children shal aske their fathers to morrow, and shal say to them: What meane these stones: <sup>22</sup> You shal teach them, and say: By the drie chanel did Israel passe ouer this Iordan, <sup>23</sup> your Lord God drying the waters therof in your sight, vntil you passed ouer: <sup>24</sup> as he had done before in the readsea, which he dried til we passed throuh: <sup>25</sup> that al the people of the earth may learne the most strong hand of our Lord, that you also may feare our Lord your God.
