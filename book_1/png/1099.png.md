both oldmen and ancientes among vs, much elder then thy
fathers. <sup>11</sup> Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee:
but thy naughtie wordes hinder it. <sup>12</sup> Why doth thy hart ele-
uate thee, and as thinking great thinges, hast thou astonied
eies. <sup>13</sup> Why doeth thy spirit swel agaynst God, to vtter such
wordes out of thy mouth. <sup>14</sup> What is man, that he should be
without spot, and that the borne of a woman should ap-
peare iust? <sup>15</sup> Behold among his sainctes none is immutable,
and the heauens are not cleane in his sight. <sup>16</sup> How much
more is man abominable, and vnprofitable, who drinketh
iniquitie as it were water? <sup>17</sup> I wil shew thee, heare me: that
which I haue seene I wil tel thee. <sup>18</sup> Wisemen confesse and
hide not their fathers. <sup>19</sup> To whom onlie the earth was geuen,
and stranger hath not passed by them. <sup>20</sup> The impious is
proud al his daies, and the number of the yeares of his ty-
rannie is vncertaine. <sup>21</sup> The sound of terrour is alwaies in his
eares: and when there is peace, he alwaies suspecteth trea-
son. <sup>22</sup> He beleueth not that he may returne from darkenesse
to light, looking round about for the sword on euerie side.
<sup>23</sup> When he shal moue himself to seeke bread, he knoweth
that the day of darkenesse is prepared in his hand. <sup>24</sup> Tribula-
tion shal terrifie him, and distresse shal compasse him, as a king
that is prepared to battel. <sup>25</sup> For he hath stretched his hand
against God, and is strengthened against the Omnipotent:
<sup>26</sup> He hath runne against him with necke set vp right, and is
armed with a fatte necke. <sup>27</sup> Fatnesse hath couered his face,
and from his sides there hangeth tallow. <sup>28</sup> He hath dwelt in
desolate cities, and in desert houses, that are brought into
hillockes. <sup>29</sup> He shal not be enriched, neither shal his sub-
stance continew, neither shal he put his roote in the earth.
<sup>31</sup> He shal not depart out of darkenes, the flame shal drie his
boughes, and he shal be taken away with the spirit of his
owne mouth. <sup>31</sup> He shal not beleue vainely deceiued with
errour, that he may be redemed with anie price. <sup>32</sup> Before his
daies be accomplished, he shal perish: and his handes shal
wither. <sup>33</sup> His cluster in the first flower shal be hurt as a vine,
and as the oliue tree casting his flower. <sup>34</sup> For the congrega-
tion of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shal deuoure their
tabernacles, which gladly take giftes. <sup>35</sup> He conceiued sorow,
and hath brought forth iniquitie, and his wombe prepareth
guiles.
