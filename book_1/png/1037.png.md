<sup>19</sup> beside their owne God, they worshiped an other, they were geuen to praye, and into the sword, and to reproch. <sup>20</sup> And as often as they were penitent for that they reuolted from the worship of their God, the God of heauen gaue them power to resist. Finally the king of the Chananeitcs, and of Iebuseitcs, and of the Pherezeites, and of the Hetheites, and of the Heueites, and of the Amorrheites, and al the mightie in Hesebon they ouerthrew, and they possessed their landes, & their cities: <sup>21</sup> and as long as they sinned not in the sight of their God, it was wel with them, for their God hateth iniquitie. <sup>22</sup> For these yeares also past when they had reuolted from the way, which God had geuen them, that they should walke in it, they were destroyed in battels by manie nations, and verie manie of them were led captiue into a strange land. <sup>23</sup> But of late returning to the Lord their God, from the dispersion wherein they were dispersed, they are vnited & are come vp into al these mountaynes, and possesse Ierusalem againe where their Holies are. <sup>24</sup> Now therefore my Lord, search if there be any iniquitie of theirs in the sight of their God: and let vs goe vp to them, because their God deliuering wil deliuer them to thee, and they shal be subdewed vnder the yoke of thy power: <sup>25</sup> but if there be no offence of this people before their God, we can not resist them, because their God wil defend them: and we shal be a reproche to the whole earth. <sup>26</sup> And it came to passe, when Achior had ceased to speake these wordes, al the great men of Holofernes were angrie, and they thought to kil him, saying to each other: <sup>27</sup> "who is this, that sayth the children of Israel can resist king Nabuchodonosor, and his armies, men vnarmed, and without force, and without skil of the feates of warre? <sup>28</sup> That Achior therefore may know that he deceiueth vs, let vs goe vp into the mountaynes: and when their mightie ones shal be taken, then shal he with them be stroken through with the sword: <sup>29</sup> that euerie nation may know that Nabuchodonosor is God of the earth, and besides him there is none other.
