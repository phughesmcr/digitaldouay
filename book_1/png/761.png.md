18 side the king of Iuda. <sup>18</sup>Asa therfore taking al the siluer, and gold that remained in the treasures of the house of our Lord, and in the treasures of the kinges house, gaue it into the handes of his seruantes: and he sent to Benadad the sonne of Tabremon the sonne of Hezion, the king of Syria, which dwelt in Damascus, saying: <sup>19</sup>There is a league betwen me and thee, & betwist my father and thy father: therfore I haue sent thee giftes, siluer and gold: and I desire thee that thou come, and make void the league, that thou hast with Baasa the king of Israel, and he may retire from me. <sup>20</sup>Benadad agreeing to king Asa, sent the princes of his armie into the cities of Israel, and they stroke Ahion, and Dan, and Abeldomum of Maacha, and al Cenneroth, to witte, al the Land of Nephthali. <sup>21</sup>Which when Baasa had heard, he intermitted to build Rama, and returned into Thersa. <sup>22</sup>But king Asa sent word into al Iuda, saying: Let no man be excused, and they tooke the stones from Rama, and the timber therof, wherwith Baasa had built, and Asa of it built Gabaa Beniamin, and Maspha. <sup>23</sup>But the rest of al the wordes of Asa, and al his forces, and al that he did, & the cities that he built, are not these written in the Booke of the wordes of the dayes of the kinges of Iuda? How beit in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feete. <sup>24</sup>And he slept with his fathers, & was buried with them in the citie of Dauid his father. And Iosaphat his sonne reigned for him. <sup>25</sup>But Nadab the sonne of Ieroboam reigned ouer Israel the second yeare of Asa the king of Iuda: and he reigned ouer Israel two yeares. <sup>26</sup>And he did that which is euil in the sight of our Lord, and walked in the waies of his father, and in his sinnes, wherwith he made Israel to sinne. <sup>27</sup>And Baasa the sonne of Ahias of the house of Issachar, lay in wayte against him, and stroke him in Gebbethon, which is a citie of the Philistimes: for Nadab and al Israel besieged Gebbethon. <sup>28</sup>Baasa therfore slew him in the third yeare of Asa the king of Iuda, and reigned for him. <sup>29</sup>And when he reigned, he stroke :: al the house of Ieroboam: he leaft not so much as one soule of his seede, til he destroied him according to the word of our Lord, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the Silonite: <sup>30</sup>for the sinnes of Ieroboam, which he had sinned, and wherwith he had caused Israel to sinne, and for the offence, wherwith he prouoked our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>31</sup>But the rest of the wordes of Nadab, and al that
