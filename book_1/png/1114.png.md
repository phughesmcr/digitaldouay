become a proverb with them. <sup>10</sup>They abhorre me, and flee
far from me, and are not afrayd to spit in my face. <sup>11</sup>For he
hath opened his quiuer, and hath afflicted me, and hath put
a bridle into my mouth. <sup>12</sup>At the right hand of me rising, my
calamities forth with arose: they haue ouerthrowen my feete,
and as with waues haue oppressed with their pathes. <sup>13</sup>They
haue dissipated my waies, they haue lyen in wayte against me,
and they haue preuailed, and there was not that would helpe.
<sup>14</sup>As when a wal is broken, and the gate opened, they haue
broken violently vpon me, and are come trambling downe to
my miseries. <sup>15</sup>I brought to nothing as a wind he hath taken
away my desire mand my prosperitie hath passed away as a
clowde. <sup>16</sup>And now my souie withereth in my self, and the
daies of affliction possesse me. <sup>17</sup>In the night my bone is pear-
sed with sorrowes: and they that eate me, sleepe not. <sup>18</sup>In the
multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they haue
girded me about, as it were with the coler of a wate. <sup>19</sup>I am
compared to durt, and am resembled to imbers and ashes.
<sup>20</sup>I crie to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand, and thou
doest not respect me. <sup>21</sup>Thou art changed to be cruel toward
me, and in the hardenesse of thy hand thou art against me.
<sup>22</sup>Thou didst lift me vp, and setting me as it were vpon the
wind thou hast mightely dashed me. <sup>23</sup>I know that thou
wilt deliuer me to death, where a house is appointed for euery
one that liueth. <sup>24</sup>But yet not to my consumption doest thou
send forth thy hand: and if they shal fal, thou wilt saue.
<sup>25</sup>I wept sometime vpon him that was afflicted, and my soul
had compassion on the poore. <sup>26</sup>I expect good thinges, and
euils are come vpon me: I taried for light, and darkenesse
brake forth. <sup>27</sup>My inner partes haue boyled without anie rest,
the dayes of affliction haue preuented me. <sup>28</sup>I went mourning
without furie, rising vp, I cried in the multitude. <sup>29</sup>I was
the brother of dragons, and felow of Ostriches. <sup>30</sup>My
skinne is made blacke vpon me, and my bones are dried with
heate. <sup>31</sup>My harpe is turned into mourning, and my instru-
ment into the voice of weepers.
