<sup>15</sup> side the cabbin, two and fourtie men, and he leaft not any of them. † And when he was gone thence, he found :: Iona- [^1]
dab the sonne of Rechab coming to meete him, and he blessed him. And he sayd to him: Is thy hart right as my hart with thy hart? And Ionadab sayd: It is. If it be so, quoth he, geue me thy hand. Who gaue him his hand. But he lifted him vp to <sup>16</sup> him into the chariote, † and sayd to him: Come with me, and see my zele for our Lord. And being sette in his chariote, <sup>17</sup> † he brought him into Samaria. And he stroke al that were leaft of Achab in Samaria, til there was not one, according <sup>18</sup> to the word of our Lord, which he spake by Elias. † Iehu therefore assembled al the people, and sayd to them: Achab worshipped Baal a litle, but :: I wil worshipe him more. [^2]
<sup>19</sup> † Now therfore cal to me al the prophetes of Baal, and al his seruantes, and al his priestes: let there be none but that he come, for I haue a great sacrifice to Baal: He that shal be wanting shal not liue. Moreouer Iehu did this craftely, that <sup>20</sup> he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. † And he sayd: <sup>21</sup> Sanctifie a solemne day to Baal. And he called † and sent into al the borders of Israel, and al the seruantes of Baal came: there was leaft not one that came not. And they entered into the temple of Baal: and the house of Baal was filled, from one end to the other. † And he sayd to them that were ouer <sup>22</sup> the garmentes: Bring forth garmentes for al the seruantes of <sup>23</sup> Baal. And they brought them forth garmentes. † And Iehu going in, and Ionadab the sonne of Rechab into the temple of Baal, sayd to the worshippers of Baal: Search, and see lest perhaps there be any with you of the seruantes of the Lord, <sup>24</sup> but that there be the seruantes of Baal onlie. †They therfore went in to make victimes and holocaustes: but Iehu had prepared him without fourescore men, and sayd to them: Whosoeuer shal escape of these men, whom I wil bring into your <sup>25</sup> handes, his life shal be for the life of him. † And it came to passe, when the holocauste was ended, Iehu commanded his souldiers and captaynes: Goe in, and strike them, let none escape. And the souldiers and captaynes stroke them in the edge of the sword, and cast them forth: and they went into <sup>26</sup> the citie of the temple of Baal, † and brought forth the statue <sup>27</sup> out of Baals temple, and burnt it, † and brake it in peeces. They destroyed also the temple of Baal, and made a iakes for <sup>28</sup> it vntil this day. † Iehu therfore destroyed Baal out of Israel:
