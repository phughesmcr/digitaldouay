<sup>15</sup> man: but by night he wil be as a theefe. The eie of the adulterer obserueth darkenesse, saying: Eie shal not see me: and he wil couer his face. <sup>16</sup> He diggeth through houses in the darke, as in the day they had appoynted with them selues, and they haue not knowen the light. <sup>17</sup> If sodenly the morning shal appeare, they thinke it the shadow of death: and they walke so in darkenesse as it were in light. <sup>18</sup> He is light about the face of the water: cursed be his portion in the earth, neither walke he by the way of the vineyardes. <sup>19</sup> Let him passe from snowe waters to exceding heate, and his sinne euen vnto hel. <sup>20</sup> Let mercie forget him: wormes his sweetnesse: be he not in remembrance, but be he broken in peeces as an vnfruitful tree. <sup>21</sup> For he hath fedd the barren, and her that bareth not, and to the widow he hath not done good. <sup>22</sup> He hath pulled downe the strong in his strength, and when he shal stand, he wil not credit his life. <sup>23</sup> God hath geuen him place for penance, and he abuseth it vnto pride: but his eies be vpon his waies. <sup>24</sup> They are eleuated for a litle, and shal not stand, and shal be humbled as al thinges, and shal be taken away, and as the toppes of the eares of corne they shal be broken. <sup>25</sup> And if it be not so, who can reproue me that I haue lied, and set my wordes before God?

<sup>1</sup> BVt Baldad the Suhite answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup> Power and terrour is with him, that maketh concord in his high ones. <sup>3</sup> Is there anie number of his souldiers? and vpon whom shal not his light arise, <sup>4</sup> can man be iustified compared with God, or the borne of a woman appeare cleane? <sup>5</sup> Behold the moone also doth not shine, and the starres are not cleane in his sight. <sup>6</sup> How much more man rottenness, & the sonne of man a worme?

CHAP. XXVI.

*Iob resisteth his aduersaries needles and common argumentes, by more sound discoursing of Gods powre, and wisdome.*

<sup>1</sup> BVt Iob answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup> Whose helper art thou? his that is weake? and doest thou hold vp the arme of him, that is not strong? <sup>3</sup> To whom hast thou geuen counsel?
