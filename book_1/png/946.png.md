name for euer, <sup>8</sup> And I wil not make the foote of Israel to
moue out of the land, which I haue deliuered to their fathers:
yet so if they shal obserue to doe that I haue commanded
them, and al the law, and the ceremonies, and iudgementes
by the hand of Moyses. <sup>9</sup> Manasses therfore seduced Iuda,
and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem, that they did euil aboue al
the nations, which our Lord had ouerthrowen before the
face of the children of Israel. <sup>10</sup> And our Lord spake to him,
and to his people, and they would not attend. <sup>11</sup> Therfore he
brought vpon them the princes of the host of the king of the
Assyrians: and they tooke Manasses, & led him bound with
chaynes, and fetters into Babylon. <sup>12</sup> Who after that he was
in distresse, prayed our Lord his God: and did penance exce-
dingly before the God of his fathers. <sup>13</sup> And he desired him,
and besought him earnestly: and he heard his prayer, and
brought him agayne to Ierusalem into his kingdom, and Ma-
nasses knew that our Lord he was God. <sup>14</sup> After these thin-
ges he built a wal without the citie of Dauid, on the west of
Gihon in the valley, from the entrance of the fish gate round-
about vnto Ophel, and raysed it exceedingly: and he appoyn-
ted princes of the host in al the fensed cities of Iuda: <sup>15</sup> and
he tooke away strange goddes, and the idol out of the house
of our Lord: the altars also which he had made in the mount
of the house of our Lord, and in Ierusalem, and he threw al
without the citie. <sup>16</sup> Moreouer he reedified the altar of our
Lord, and immolated vpon it victimes, and pacifiques, and
prayse: and he commanded Iuda to serue our Lord the God
of Israel. <sup>17</sup> Neuerthelesse as yet the people immolated in the
excelses to our Lord their God. <sup>18</sup> But the rest of the actes of
Manasses: and his obsecration to his God: the wordes also of
the Seers, that spake to him in the name of our Lord the God
of Israel, are conteyned in the wordes of the kinges of Israel.
<sup>19</sup> His prayer also, and his obteining, and al his sinnes,
and contempt, the places also wherein he built excelses, and
made groues, and statues before he did penance, are writen
in the wordes of Hozai. <sup>20</sup> Manasses therfore slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in his house: & his sonne Amon
reigned for him. <sup>21</sup> Ammon was two and twentie yeares old
when he began to reigne, and he reigned two yeares in Ieru-
salem. <sup>22</sup> And he did euil in the sight of our Lord, as Manasses
his father had done: and he immolated to al the idols, which
