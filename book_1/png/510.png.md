they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king
of Iericho. <sup>31</sup> From Lebna he passed vnto Lachis with al Israel: and placing the hoste round about assaulted it. <sup>32</sup> And
our Lord deliuered Lachis into the handes of Israel, and he
tooke it the day folowing, and stroke it in the edge of the

to Lebna. <sup>33</sup> At that time went vp Horam the king of Gazer,
to ayde Lachis: whom Iosue stroke with al his people to vtter
destruction. <sup>34</sup> And he passed from Lachis vnto Eglon, and
compassed it, <sup>35</sup> and wonne it the same day: & stroke in the
edge of the sword al the soules, that were in it according to al
thinges that he had done to Lachis <sup>36</sup> He went vp also with
al Israel from Eglon vnto Hebron, and fought against it:
<sup>37</sup> tooke it, and stroke it in the edge of the sword, the king also
therof, and al townes of that countrie, & al the soules, that
remained in it: he left not therein anie remaynes: as he had
done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, al thinges that he
found in it consuming with the sword. <sup>38</sup> Thence returning
vnto Dabir, <sup>39</sup> he tooke it, and wasted it: the king also therof
and al the townes round about he stroke in the edge of the
sword: he left not in it anie remaines: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna and to their kinges, so did he to Dabir and
the king therof. <sup>40</sup> Iosue therfore stroke al the hillie countrie
and south and champaine, and Asedoth with their kinges:
he left not in it anie reliques, but euerie thing that could
breath he slew, as our Lord the God of Israel had commanded
him, <sup>41</sup> from Cadesbarne vnto Gaza. Al the Land of Gosen
vnto Gabaon, <sup>42</sup> and al their kinges, and countries he tooke
and wasted at one assault: for our Lord the God of Israel
fought for him. <sup>43</sup> And he returned with al Israel to the place
of the campe in Galgal.
