Manasses portions. IOSVE.

which looketh to Sichem: and goeth out on the right hand
beside the inhabitantes of the Fountaine of Taphua.
<sup>8</sup> For in the lotte of Manasses was fallen the Land of
Taphua, which is beside the borders of Manasses,
the childrens of Ephraim. <sup>9</sup> And the border of the
Reede valley went downe into the south of the torrent of
the cities of Ephraim, which are in the middes of the cities
of Manasses: the border of Manasses on the North of the
torrent, and the issue therof goeth to the sea: <sup>10</sup> so that the
possession of Ephraim is on the South, and on the North of
Manasses, and the sea incloseth both, and they be ioyned one
to an other in the tribe of Aser on the Noth, and in the tribe
of Issachar on the East. <sup>11</sup> And the inheritance of Manasses
in Issachar and in Aser was Bethsan and the villages therof,
and Ieblaam with the villages therof, and the inhabitantes of
Dor, with the townes therof, the inhabitantes also of Endor
with the townes therof. and in like maner the inhabitantes
of Thenac with the townes therof, and the inhabitantes of
Mageddo with the townes therof, and the third part of the
citie of Nopheth. <sup>12</sup> Neither could the children of Manasses
ouerthrow these cities, but the Chananeite began to dwel in
his Land. <sup>13</sup> But after that the children of Israel grew to
be strong, they subdewed the Chananeites, and made them
their tributaries, neither did they kil them. <sup>14</sup> And the children of Ioseph spake to Iosue, and said: Why hast thou geuen
me the possession of one lotte and corde, wheras I am of so
great a multitude, and our Lord hath blessed me? <sup>15</sup> To whom
Iosue said: If thou be a great people, goe vp into the wood,
and cutte thee roome in the Land of the Pherezeite and Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is narrow
for thee. <sup>16</sup> To whom the children of Ioseph answered:
We can not goe vp to the mountaines, wheras the Chananeite
that dwel in the champayne countrie, wherein are situated
Bethsan with the townes therof, and Iezrael possessing the
middes of the valley, vse yron chariottes. <sup>17</sup> And Iosue said
to the house of Ioseph, of Ephraim and Manasses: Thou art
a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not haue one
lotte, <sup>18</sup> but thou shalt passe to the mountaine, and shalt cutte
and make glades for thee to inhabite: and mayest procede
farder, when thou hast subuerted the Chananeite, whom
thou sayest to haue yron chariottes, and to be very strong.
