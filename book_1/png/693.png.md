therefore arose and sate in the gate: and it was told al the
people that the king sate in the gate: and al the multitude
came forth before the king, but Israel fled into their taber-
nacles. <sup>9</sup> Al the people also stroue in al the tribes of Israel,
saying: The king hath deliuered vs out of the hand of our
enemies, he hath saued vs from the head of the Philistianes:
and now he fled out of the land for Absalom. <sup>10</sup> But Absalom
whom we annoynted ouer vs, is dead in the battel: how long
are you stil, and reduce not the king? <sup>11</sup> But king Dauid sent
to Sadoc, and Abiathar the priestes, saying: Speake to the
Ancientes of Iuda, saying: Why come you last to bring
backe the king into his house? (And the saying of al Israel
was come to the king in his house.) <sup>12</sup> You are my brethren,
you my bone, and my flesh, why do you last bring backe the
king? <sup>13</sup> And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and
my flesh? These thinges do God to me, and these adde he, if
thou be not the chiefe captayne of warfare before me al-
wayes for Ioab. <sup>14</sup> And he inclined the hart of al the men of
Iuda, as it were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying:
<sup>15</sup> Returne thou, and al thy seruantes. <sup>15</sup> And the king retur-
ned, and came as far as Iordan, and al Iuda came as far as Gal-
gal to meete the king, and to bring him ouer Iordan. <sup>16</sup> And
Semei the sonne of Gera the sonne of Iemini of Bahurim
made hast, and went downe with the men of Iuda to meete
king Dauid <sup>17</sup> with a thousand men of Beniamin, and Siba
the seruant of the house of Saul: and his fiftene sonnes, and
twentie seruantes were with him: and rushing into Iordan,
<sup>18</sup> passed the fordes before the king, that they might helpe
ouer the kinges houshould, and doe according to his com-
mandement. And Semei the sonne of Gera prostrate before
the king, when he had now passed Iordan, <sup>19</sup> sayd to him:
Impute not to me my lord the iniquitie, nor remember the
iniuries of thy seruant in the day that thou my lord king
wentest out of Ierusalem, nor put it in thy hart o king. <sup>20</sup> For
I thy seruant acknowledge my sinne: and therefore this day
I am first come of al the house of Ioseph, and am descended
to meete my lord the king. <sup>21</sup> But Abisai the sonne of Saruia
answering, sayd: What shal Semei for these wordes not be
slayne, because he reuiled the annoynted of our Lord? <sup>22</sup> And
Dauid sayd: What is to me and you ye sonnes of Saruia? Why
are you made this day as satan to me? Shal there a man be
