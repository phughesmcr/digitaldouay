<sup>38</sup> in Samaria, and washed his chariote in the poole of Samaria, and the dogges licked his bloud, and they washed the raynes of the bridle, according to the word of our Lord which he had spoken. <sup>39</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Achab, and al that he did, and the house of yuorie, that he built, and of al the cities that he built, are not these thinges written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Israel? <sup>40</sup> Achab therfore slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his sonne reigned for him. <sup>41</sup> But Iosaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne ouer Iuda the fourth yeare of Achab the king of Israel. <sup>42</sup> Fiue and thirtie yeares old was he when he began to reigne, and fiue and twentie yeares he reigned in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Azuba the daughter of Salai. <sup>43</sup> And he walked in al the way of Asa his father, and he declined not from it: and he did that which was right in the sight of our Lord. <sup>44</sup> But yet he tooke not away the excelses: for as yet the people did sacrifice, and burnt incense in the excelses. <sup>45</sup> And Iosaphat had peace with the king of Israel. <sup>46</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Iosaphat, and his workes, which he did, and his battels, are not these thinges written in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>47</sup> Yea and the remnant of the effeminate, which remayned in the daies of Asa his father, he tooke out of the land. <sup>48</sup> Neither was there then a king appoynted in Edom. <sup>49</sup> But king Iosaphat had made nauies on the sea, which should saile into Ophir for gold: and they could not goe, because they were broken in Asiongaber. <sup>50</sup> Then sayd Ochozias the sonne of Achab to Iosaphat: Let my seruantes goe with thy seruantes in the shippes. And Iosaphat would not. <sup>51</sup> And Iosaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the Citie of Dauid his father: and Ioram his sonne reigned for him. <sup>52</sup> And Ochozias the sonne of Achab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, in the seuenteenth yeare of Iosaphat the king of Iuda, and he reigned ouer Israel two yeares. <sup>53</sup> And he did euil in the sight of our Lord, and walked in the way of his father and his mother, and in the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, who made Israel to sinne. <sup>54</sup> He serued also Baal, and adored him, and prouoked our Lord the God of Israel, according to al thinges which his father had done.
