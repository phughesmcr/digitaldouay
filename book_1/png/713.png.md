better then him self: and slew them with his sword, my father
Dauid not knowing, Abner the sonne of Ner general of the
warfare of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether general of the
armie of Iuda: <sup>33</sup>and their bloud shal returne vpon the head of
Ioab, and vpon the head of his seede for euer. But to Dauid
and his seede and his house, and to his throne be peace for
euer from our Lord. <sup>34</sup>Banaias therfore the sonne of Ioiada
went vp, and setting vpon him slewe him: and he was buried
in his house in the desert. <sup>35</sup>And the king appoynted Banaias
the sonne of Ioiada for him ouer the armie, and Sadoc the
priest he placed for Abiathar. <sup>36</sup>The king also sent, and
called Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Ierusalem,
and dwel there: and thou shalt not goe out thence hither and
thither. <sup>37</sup>But what day soeuer thou shalt goe out, and shalt
passe the Torrent Cedron know that thou art to be slaine: thy
bloud shal be vpon thy head. <sup>38</sup>And Semei said to the king:
The saying is good: as my lord the king hath spoken, so wil
thy seruant doe. Semei therfore dwelt in Ierusalem, manie
dayes. <sup>39</sup>And it came to passe after three yeares, that the ser-
uantes of Semei fled to Achis the sonne of Maacha the king
of Geth: and it was told Semei that his seruantes were gone
into Geth. <sup>40</sup>And Semei arose, and sadled his asse, and went
to Achis into Geth to require his seruantes, and he brought
them out of Geth. <sup>41</sup>And it was told Salomon that Semei
went into Geth out of Ierusalem, and was returned. <sup>42</sup>And
sending he called him, and said to him: Did I not testifie to
thee by our Lord, and told thee before: What day soeuer thou
going out shalt passe hither & thither, know that thou shalt
die? And thou didst answere me: The saying is good, which
I haue heard. <sup>43</sup>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of our
Lord, and the precept that I commanded thee? <sup>44</sup>And the
king said to Semei: Thou knowest al the euil, wherof thy hart
is priuy to thy selfe, which thou didst to Dauid my father: our
Lord hath rendred thy malice vpon thy head: <sup>45</sup>And king
Salomon be blessed, and the throne of Dauid shal be stable
before our Lord for euer. <sup>46</sup>The king therefore commanded
Banaias the sonne of Ioiada: who going out, stroke him, and
he died.

CHAP. III.

[^1]: Salomon was not only a king but also a prophet. More-ouer some se-uere punices doe terminate spiritual topa-tion, and in-struction is not repugning to the princes but the prince to be directed by them. Num. 27. v. 21.
