<sup>23</sup> prince, and Sadoc for the high priest. <sup>24</sup> And Salomon sate vpon the throne of our Lord as king for Dauid his father, and he pleased al: & al Israel obeyed him. <sup>25</sup> Yea and al the princes, and men of might, and al the sonnes of king Dauid gaue their hand, and were subiect to Salomon the king. <sup>26</sup> Our Lord therfore magnified Salomon ouer al Israel: and gaue him the glorie of a kingdom, such as no king of Israel had before him. <sup>27</sup> Dauid therfore the sonne of Isai reigned ouer al Israel. <sup>28</sup> And the daies, that he reigned ouer Israel, were fourtie yeares: in Hebron he reigned seuen yeares, and in Ierusalem three and thirtie yeares. <sup>29</sup> And he died in a good age, ful of daies, and riches, and glorie. And Salomon his sonne reigned for him. <sup>30</sup> But the actes of king Dauid the first and the last are writen in the Booke of Samuel the Seer, & in the Booke of Nathan the prophete, & in the Volume of Gad the Seer: and of al his kingdom, and strength, and of the times, that passed vnder him, either in Israel, or in al the kingdomes of the earth.

THE ARGVMENT OF THE SECOND BOOKE OF PARALIPOMENON.

As the former booke sheweth, how after manie generations from the beginning of the world, God selecting one special nation for his peculiar people, and the same being afterwardes made a kingdome, the scepter therof, both by Gods and the peoples election, came to Dauid, and his sonne Salomon: So this booke declareth that first Salomon reigned peaceably ouer the whole kingdom, in the nine first chapters. Then, in the other twentie seuen chapters, relateth how the same kingdom was diuided, tenne tribes being taken away (the historie wherof is but here briefly touched) and two only, with the title of the kingdom of Iuda, were possessed, by succession of ninetenne kinges, al of Dauids and Salomons issue, in royal estate til the captiuitie in Babylon.

[^1]: Either Nathan and Gad writ the later part of the first booke, and the second booke of kinges, or els their bookes are not now extant.
