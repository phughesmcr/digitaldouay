<sup>12</sup>Surie is wrath against me, and he hath so accounted me as his enemie. <sup>13</sup>His souldiars haue come together, and haue made them selues a way by me, and haue besieged my tabernacle round about. <sup>14</sup>He hath made my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance as strangers haue departed from me. <sup>15</sup>My kinsemen haue forsaken me, and they that knew me haue forgotten me. <sup>16</sup>The ghestes of my house, and my mayd-seruantes haue counted me an alien, and I haue bene as it were a stranger in their eies. <sup>17</sup>I called my seruant, and he did not answer me, with mine owne mouth I besought him. <sup>18</sup>My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I prayed the children of my wombe. <sup>19</sup>Fooles also despised me, and when I was departed from them, they backbited me. <sup>20</sup>My counsellers sometime haue abhorred me: and he[^1] whom I loued most hath turned against me. <sup>21</sup>The flesh being consumed my bone hath cleaued to my skinne, and there are left onlie lippes about my teeth. <sup>22</sup>Haue mercie vpon me, haue mercie vpon me, at the least you my frendes, because the hand of our Lord hath touched me. <sup>23</sup>Why doe you as God persecute me, and are filled with my flesh. <sup>24</sup>Who wil grant that my wordes may be writen? who wil geue me that they may be drawen in a booke, <sup>25</sup>with yron penne, and in plate of leade, or els with stile might be grauen in flintstone? <sup>26</sup>For[^2] I know that my Redemer liueth, and in the last day I shal rise out of the earth. <sup>27</sup>And I shal be compassed agayne with my skinne, and in my flesh I shal see God. <sup>28</sup>Whom I my self shal see, and mine eies shal behold, and[^3] none other: this my hope is layd vp in my bosome. <sup>29</sup>Why then doe you say now: Let vs persecute him, and let vs finde roote of word agaynst him? <sup>30</sup>Flee therefore from the face of the sword, because the sword is the reuenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is iudgement.
