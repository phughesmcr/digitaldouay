<sup>14</sup> Omnipotent if his children be multiplied, they shal be in the sword, & nephewes shal not be filled with bread. <sup>15</sup> They that shal be leaft of him, shal be buried in death, and his widowes shal not weepe. <sup>16</sup> If he shal heape together siluer as earth, and as clay shal prepare garmentes: <sup>17</sup> He shal prepare in deede, but the iust man shal be clothed with them: and the innocent shal diuide the siluer. <sup>18</sup> He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper hath he made a bowre. <sup>19</sup> The rich man when he shal sleepe shal take away nothing with him: he shal oppen his eies, & finde nothing. <sup>20</sup> Pouertie as water shal apprehend him, in the night a tempest shal oppresse him. <sup>21</sup> The burning wind shal take him vp, and cary him away, and as a whirlewinde shal pul him violently out of his place. <sup>22</sup> And he shal cast vpon him, and shal not spare: out of his hand flying he shal flee. <sup>23</sup> He shal claspe his handes vpon him, and shal hisse vpon him, beholding his place.
