And our Lord sayd to him: Goe vp, and I wil deliver them into thy hand. <sup>11</sup> And when they were come vp into Baalpharasim, David stroke them there, and sayd: God hath divided myn enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baal Pharasim. <sup>12</sup> And they leaft there their goddes, which David commanded to be burnt. <sup>13</sup> An other time also the Philisthijms invaded, and were dispersed in the Vale. <sup>14</sup> And David consulted God agayne, and God sayd to him: Goe not vp after them, retyre from them, and thou shalt come agaynst them over agaynst the pearetrees. <sup>15</sup> And when thou shalt heare the sound of one going in the toppe of the pearetrees, then shalt thou yssue forth to battel. For God is gone forth before thee, to strike the campe of the Philisthijms. <sup>16</sup> David therefore did as God had commanded him, and stroke the campe of the Philisthianes from Gabaon vnto Gazera. <sup>17</sup> And the name of David was bruited in al countries, and our Lord gave the dreade of him over al nations.
