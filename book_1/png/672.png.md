CHAP. X.

*Hanon king of Ammon for euil entreating Dauids men, sent vnto him of
curtesie, is iustly plagued, with his confederates. 15. Also the second
time they are ouerthrowen by Dauid.*

<sup>1</sup> AND it came to passe after these thinges, that the king of
the children of Ammon died, and Hanon his sonne
reigned for him. <sup>2</sup> And Dauid said: I wil doe mercie with
Hanon the sonne of Naas, as his father hath done mercie
with me. Dauid therefore sent, conforting him by his ser-

Dauid hath sent comforters vnto thee, and not rather that
he might search, and spie into the citie, and ouerthrow it, hath
Dauid sent his seruants vnto thee? <sup>4</sup> Hanon therefore tooke
the seruants of Dauid, and shaued the one half of their beards,
and cutte away halfe their garmentes vnto the buttockes, and
sent them away. <sup>5</sup> Which when it was told Dauid, he sent to
meete them: for the men were confounded very sowly, and
Dauid commanded them: Tary in Iericho, til your beard be
growen, and then returne. <sup>6</sup> And the children of Ammon
seing that they had done iniurie to Dauid, sent, and hyred for
wages the Syrian of Rohob, and the Syrian of Soba, twentie
thousand footemen, and of the king Maacha a thousand men,
and of Istob twelue thousand men. <sup>7</sup> Which when Dauid had
heard, he sent Ioab and the whole armie of warriers. <sup>8</sup> The
children therefore of Ammon issued forth, and sette their
men in aray before the verie entrance of the gate: but the
Syrian of Soba, and Rohab, and Istob, and Maacha were
by them selues in the fielde. <sup>9</sup> Ioab therefore seing, that
