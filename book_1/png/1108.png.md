meas gold that passeth through the fyre: My foote hath folowed his steppes, I haue kept his way, & haue not declined out if it. From the commandementes of his lippes I haue not departed, and I haue hid the wordes of his mouth in my bosome. For he is alone, and no man can turne away his cogitation: and whatsoeuer his soule would, that hath he done. And when he shal haue fulfilled his wil in me, manie other things also are at hand wit him. And therfore I am trubled at his face, and considering, him I am made pensife with feare. God hath mollified my hart, and the Omnipotent hath trubled me. For I haue not perished because of the imminent darkenesses, neither hath the mist couered my face.

CHAP. XXIIII.

*God in his prouidence knoweth when he wil punish the wicked, which his true seruantes know not, much lesse the impious.*

<sup>1</sup>Times are not hid from the Omnipotent: but they that know him, know not his daies. Some haue transferred boundes, spoyled flockes, & fed them. <sup>2</sup>They haue driuen away the asse of pupilles, & haue taken away the widowes oxe for a pledge. <sup>3</sup>They haue subuerted the way of the poore, and haue oppressed together the meeke of the earth. <sup>4</sup>Others as wilde asses in the deserte goe forth to their worke: watching to the praye, doe prepare bread for their children. <sup>5</sup>They reape the filde that is not theirs, and gather the grapes of his vineyard, whom by violence they haue oppressed. <sup>6</sup>They send men away naked, taking away their clothes, which haue no couering in the cold. <sup>7</sup>Whom the showers of the mountaynes doe wash, and not hauing a couert, they embrace stones. <sup>8</sup>They did violence spoyling the pupilles, and the common poore people they spoyled. <sup>9</sup>From the naked and them that goe without clothing, and the hungrie they haue taken away the eares of corne. <sup>10</sup>They haue rested the noone tide among their heapes, which hauing troden the wine presses are a thirst. <sup>11</sup>Out of the cities they haue made men to mourne, and the soule of the wounded hath cryed, and God doth not suffer it to passe vnreuenged: <sup>12</sup>They haue bene rebellious to the light, they haue not knowen his wayes, neither did they returne by his pathes. <sup>13</sup>At the verie breake of day the murderer ryseth, he killeth the needie, and the poore man.

[^1]: Gods seruantes know that he wil punish wickednes, but know not when: the wicked presume that he wil neuer punish them.
