<sup>9</sup> And there rose Balac the sonne of Sephor king of Moab, and fought against Israel. And he sent and called Balaam the sonne of Beor, that he might curse you: <sup>10</sup> and I would not heare him, but contrariwise by him I blessed you, and deliuered you out of his hand. <sup>11</sup> And you passed Iordan, and came to Iericho. And the men of that citie fought against you, the Amorrheite, and Pherezite and Chananite, and the Hetheite, and Gergeseite, and the Heueite, and Iebuseite: and I deliuered them into your handes. <sup>12</sup> And I sent before you hornettes: and I cast them forth out of their places, the two Kinges of the Amorrheites, not in thy sword and bow. <sup>13</sup> And I gaue you the Land, wherein you laboured not, and the cities which you built not, to dwel in them: vineyardes and oliue trees, which you planted not. <sup>14</sup> Now therfore feare our Lord and serue him with a perfect and verie true hart: and take away the goddes, which your fathers serued in Mesopotamia and in Ægypt, and serue our Lord. <sup>15</sup> But if it like you not to serue our Lord, choise is geuen you: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you ought especially to serue, whether the goddes, which your fathers serued in Mesopotamia, or the goddes of the Amorrheites, in whose Land you dwel: but I and my house wil serue our Lord. <sup>16</sup> And the people answered, and said: God forbid we should leaue our Lord, and serue strange goddes. <sup>17</sup> Our Lord God he brought vs, and our fathers out of the Land of Ægypt, out of the house of seruitude: and did in our sight great signes, and kept vs in al the way, by the which we walked, and among al the peoples, through which we passed. <sup>18</sup> And he hath cast out al the nations, the Amorrheite inhabitez of the Land, which we haue entred. We therfore wil serue our Lord, because he is our God. <sup>19</sup> And Iosue said to the people: You can not serue our Lord: for God is holie, and a mightie emulator, neither wil he pardon your wicked-nes and sinnes. <sup>20</sup> If you leaue our Lord, and serue strange goddes, he wil turne him self, and wil afflict you, and ouer-throw you after he hath geuen you good thinges. <sup>21</sup> And the people said to Iosue: No, it shal not be so as thou speakest, but we wil serue our Lord. <sup>22</sup> And Iosue said to the people: You are witnesses, that your selues haue chosen to you our Lord for to serue him. And they answered: Witnesses.
