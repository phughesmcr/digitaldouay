# Church and Religion.

admonished Priestes in his time, that wheras they were negligent; not performing their duties, their sinne was the greater, for that their authoritie stil remained, and the perpetual Rule of the Law, that the lippes of the Priest shal kepe knowlege, and they (other men generally) shal require the law of his mouth, because he is the Angel of the Lord of hostes.

<aside>Priestes by their negligence do not lose their authoritie.</aside>

And al Princes & others were to receiue the law at the priestes had of the Leuitical Tribe. *This was the warrant of stabilitie in truth of the Synagogue in the old Testament.* Much more the Church and spouse of Christ, whose excellencie and singular priuileges Salomon describeth in his canticle of canticles, hath such warrant. Of this spouse al the Prophets write, & that more plainlie then of Christ himself, forseing more aduersaries bending their forces against her; *as s. Augustine obserueth, then against Christ her head.* And the same holie father in manie places teacheth, that she neither perisheth, nor loseth her beutie, for the mixture of euil members, in respect of whom she is blacke, but fayre in respect of the good, *Cantic. 1. Notwithstanding therfore sinners remaining within the Church, schismatikes and heretikes breaking from the Church, stil she remaineth the pillar and firmament of truth; the virgin daughter of Sion.*

# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKES OF ESDRAS.

ESDRAS a holie Priest and Scribe, of the stocke of Aaron, by the line of Eleazar, writ the historie of Gods people, in, and presently after their captiuitie in Babylon: which Nehemias an other godlie Priest prosecuteth, whose booke is also called the second of Esdras, because in the Hebrew and Greke they are but one booke, relating the acts of them both. The other two bookes called the third and fourth of Esdras, touching the same matter, are not in the Hebrew, nor receiued into the Canon of holie Scripture, though the Greke Church hold the third booke as Canonical, and placeth it first, because it conteyneth thinges donne before the other.

<aside>The two bookes of Esdras and Nehemias are but one in the Hebrew.</aside>

<aside>The third and fourth are not canonical.</aside>

In the two here folowing, which are vndoubtedly holie Scripture S. Ierom sayth, that Esdras and Nehemias (to witte the Helper, and Comforter from God) restored the Temple, and built the walles of the citie; adding that al the troope of the people returning into their countrie, also the description of Priestes, Leuites, Israelites, Proselites, and the workes of walles and towres diuided by seueral families, *aliud in cortice praferunt, aliud in medulla retinent*, shew one thing in the barke, kepe an other thing in the marrow: signifying that this historie hath both a literal, and a mystical sense. According to the letter, this first booke sheweth the reduction of Gods people from Babylon; in the first six chapters. In the other foure, their instruction by Esdras after their returne.

<aside>This historie hath also a spiritual sense</aside>

<aside>First booke diuided into two partes.</aside>
