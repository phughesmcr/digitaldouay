Samson.

<sup>5</sup> thou shalt conceiue and beare a sonne, whose head the raser shal not touch: for he shal be a Nazareite of God from his infancie, and from his mothers wombe, and he shal beginne to deliuer Israel from the handes of the Phili- <sup>6</sup> stijmes. Who when she was come to her husband, said to him: A man of God came to me, hauing an Angelical countenance, exceeding terrible. Whom when I had asked, who he was, and whence he came, and by what name he was cal- <sup>7</sup> led, he would not tel me: but this he answered: Behold thou shalt conceiue and beare a sonne: beware thou drinke not wine, nor sicer, and that thou eate not any vncleane thing: for the child shal be the Nazereite of God from his infancie, and from his mothers wombe vntil the day of his <sup>8</sup> death. Manue therfore prayed to our Lord, and said: I beseech thee ô Lord, that the man of God, whom thou didst send, may come againe, and teach vs what we ought to doe <sup>9</sup> concerning the child, that shal be borne. And our Lord heard Manue praying, and the Angel of our Lord appeared againe to his wife sitting in the field. but Manue her husband <sup>10</sup> was not with her. Who when she had seene the Angel, hastened, and ranne to her husband: and she told him, saying: Behold the man hath appeared to me, whom I saw before. <sup>11</sup> Who rose, and folowed his wife: and comming to the man, said to him: Art thou he that didst speake to the woman? <sup>12</sup> And he answered: I am. To whom Manue, when, sayd he, thy word shal be fulfilled, what wilt thou that the child doe? <sup>13</sup> or from what shal he keepe him self? And the Angel of our Lord said to Manue: From al thinges, which I haue spo- <sup>14</sup> ken to thy wife, let him refraine him self: and whatsoeuer groweth of the vineyard, let him not eate: wine and sicer let him not drinke, let him not eate any vncleane thing: and whatsoeuer I haue commanded her, let him fulfil and keepe. <sup>15</sup> And Manue said to the Angel of our Lord: I beseech thee that thou condescend to my petitions, and let vs make to <sup>16</sup> thee a kidde of goates. To whom the Angel answered: If thou constraine me, I wil not eate thy breade: but if thou wilt make holocaust, offer it to our Lord. And Manue knew <sup>17</sup> not that it was an Angel of our Lord. And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shal be fulfilled, we may <sup>18</sup> honour thee? To whom he answered: Why askest thou my name,
