who came forth to meete Dauid, and the people that were
with him. And Dauid coming to the people, saluted them
<sup>22</sup> peaceably. And euerie naughtie, and wicked felow of the
men, that had gone with Dauid answering, sayd: Because
they came not with vs, we wil not geue them anie thing of
the praye, which we haue recouered: but let their wife and
children suffice euerie man, whom when they haue receiued,
<sup>23</sup> let them depart. But Dauid sayd: You shal not doe so my
brethren, of these thinges, which our Lord hath deliuered to
vs, and hath kept vs, and hath geuen the theeues, that were
<sup>24</sup> broken out against vs, into our handes: neither shal anie
man heare you vpon this talke. For there shal be equal portion
of him that went downe into battel, and of him that abode at
<sup>25</sup> the baggage, & they shal diuide alike. And this hath beene
downe from that day, and euer after it was decreed, and
<sup>26</sup> ordained as a law in Israel. Dauid therefore came into Sice-
leg, and sent giftes of the praye to the ancientes of Iuda his
neighbours, saying: Take a benediction of the praye of our
<sup>27</sup> Lords enemies. To them, that were in Bethel, and that were
in Ramoth toward the South, and them that were in Gether,
<sup>28</sup> and them in Aroer, and them in Sephamoth, and them in
<sup>29</sup> Esthamo, and them in Rachal, and them in the cities of Ie-
<sup>30</sup> rameel, and them in the cities of Ceni, and them in Hara-
ma, and them in the lake of Asan, and them in Athach,
<sup>31</sup> and them in Hebron, and to the rest that were in those
places, in the which Dauid had taried, and his men.

<sup>1</sup> AND the Philistijms fought against Israel, and the men
of Israel fled before the face of the Philistijms, and fel

Saul, and vpon his sonnes, and they stroke Ionathas, and A-
<sup>3</sup> binadab, and Melchisua the sonnes of Saul, and the whole
weight of the battel was turned vpon Saul: and the archers
ouertook him, and he was sore wounded of the archers.
<sup>4</sup> And Saul sayd to his esquire: Drawe out thy sword, and
strike me: lest perhaps these vncircumcised come, and kil me,
mocking me. And his esquire would not: for he was frighted
with exceding feare. Saul therefore caught his sword, and fel
