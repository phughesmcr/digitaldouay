# THE ARGVMENT OF THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF KINGES.

This fourth booke prosecuteth the historie of the two Kingdomes of Iuda and Israel, to the seueral captiuities of them both. Shewing manie special vertues and heroical actes of good Kinges, Prophetes, and other godlie persons: and diuers crimes of the wicked. For in Iuda were some good kinges, highly commended; some euil, whom God spared in this world for Dauids sake. So that in both senses King Dauids seede continued in his throne, and royal state (first in the twelue tribes, afterward in two) nere foure hundred fourescore yeares. And after the captiuitie (as wil appeare in the age ensuing) it was conserued in honour and estimation, til Christ our Sauiour. But in the Kingdome of Israel (or tenne tribes) which stood about two hundred fiftie yeares, was great change, by raysing and extirpating royal families. Al their kinges were bad, yet partly were set vp by God himself, partly suffred to reigne; and in both Kingdomes, were true and false prophetes, God vsing the ministerie of al, to his owne glorie, the good of his Church, and punishment of others, and sometimes of themselues. So this booke may be diuided into two partes. In the seuentene former chapters, are recorded ioyntly and mixedly the principal thinges donne in both kingdomes; til the captiuitie of the tenne tribes. The other eight chapters conteine other thinges donne in Iuda, vntil their captiuitie in Babylon.
