the princes of the multitude had sworne in the name of our Lord the God of Israel. Therefore al the common people <sup>19</sup> murmured against the princes. Who answered them: We haue sworne to them in the name of our Lord the God of <sup>20</sup> Israel, and therfore we may not touch them. But this we wil doe to them: Let them be reserued in dede aliue, lest the wrath of God be stirred against vs, if we shal be forsworne: <sup>21</sup> but so let them liue, that for the vses of the whole multitude they hew wood, and carie in water. Who speaking these <sup>22</sup> thinges, Iosue called the Gabaonites, and said to them: Why would you deceiue vs by fraude to say: We dwel very farre of from you, wheras you are in the middes of vs? <sup>23</sup> Therfore you shal be vnder a curse, and there shal not faile of your stocke a hewer of wood, and a carier of water into <sup>24</sup> the house of my God. Who answered: It was told vs thy seruantes, that the Lord thy God had promised Moyses his seruant, that he would deliuer you al the Land, and would destroy al the inhabitantes therof. Therfore we feared excedingly and prouided for our liues, cõpelled by your terrour, <sup>25</sup> and we tooke this counsel. And now we are in thy hand: that which seemeth vnto thee good and right, doe to vs. <sup>26</sup> Iosue therfore did as he had said, and deliuered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be <sup>27</sup> slaine. And he decreed in that day, that they should be in the ministerie of al the people, and of the altar of our Lord, hewing wood, and carying water, vntil this present time, in the place which our Lord hath chosen.

<sup>1</sup> WHICH thinges when Adonisedec king of Ierusalem had heard, to witte, that Iosue had taken Hai, and had subuerted it (for as he had done to Iericho & the king therof, so did he to Hai, & their king) and that the Ga- <sup>2</sup> baonites were fled to Israel, and were their confederates, he was sore afrayd. For Gabaon was a great cittie, and one of
