him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophete, and Banaias
the sonne of Ioiada, and Cerethi, and Phelethi, and they haue
set him vpon the kinges mule. <sup>45</sup>And Sadoc the priest, and Na-
than the prophete haue annointed him king in Gihon: & they
are gone vp thence reioysing, and the citie sounded: this is
the voice that you heard. <sup>46</sup>Yea and Salomon sitteth vpon
the throne of the kingdom. <sup>47</sup>And the kinges seruantes en-
tring in, haue blessed our lord king Dauid, saying: God
amplify the name of Salomon aboue thy name, and magnifie
his throne aboue thy throne. And the king :: adored in his
bed: <sup>48</sup>and he hath thus spoken: Blessed be our Lord the
God of Israel, who hath geuen this day one sitting in my
throne, mine eies seing it <sup>49</sup>They therfore were terrified,
and they al arose, that had beene inuited of Adonias, and
euery man went his way. <sup>50</sup>And Adonias fearing Salomon

told Salomon, saying: Behold Adonias fearing king Salomon,
hath taken hold of the horne of the altar, saying: Let king
Salomon sweare to me this day, that he wil not kil his seruant
with the sword. <sup>52</sup>And Salomon sayd: If he be a good man,
there shal not so much as one heate of his fal vpon the
ground: but if euil shal be found in him, he shal die. <sup>53</sup>King
Salomon therfore sent, and brought him out from the altar:
and going in he adored king Salomon: and Salomon sayd to
him: Goe to thy house.
