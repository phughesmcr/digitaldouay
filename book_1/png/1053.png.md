CHAP. XVI.

*Iudith singeth a canticle of thankes geuing to our Lord. 22. The people goe to Ierusalem and offer sacrifices. 25. She in great honour liueth a widow til her death in good old age. 30. the people haue long peace, and a festiual day is instituted in perpetual memorie of her fact.*

<sup>1</sup> THEN sang Iudith this song to our Lord, saying: <sup>2</sup> Beginne ye to our Lord in timbrels, sing ye to our Lord in cymbals, tune to him a new psalme, reioyce, and inuocate his name. <sup>3</sup> Our Lord confoundeth battels, Lord is his name. <sup>4</sup> Who hath set his campe in the middes of his people, that he might deliuer vs from the hand of al our enemies. <sup>5</sup> Assur came out of the mountaynes from the North in the multitude of his strength: whose multitude stopped vp the torrentes, and their horses couered the valles. <sup>6</sup> He said that he would set my borders on fyre, and kil my yongmen with the sword, to geue my infantes into praye, and virgins into captiuitie. <sup>7</sup> But our Lord omnipotent hath hurt him, and hath deliuered him into the hands of a woman, and hath pearced him. <sup>8</sup> For, not by yongmen is their mightie one fallen, neither haue the sonnes of Titan strooken him, neither did the high giantes set them selues vpon him, but Iudith the daughter of Merari in the beautie of her face dissolued him. <sup>9</sup> For she put from her the garmentes of widow-hood, and put on her the garmentes of ioy, in the reioycing of the children of Israel. <sup>10</sup> She anoynted her face with oyntment, and tyed together her lockes with a crowne, she tooke a new stole to deceiue him. <sup>11</sup> Her sandals rauished his eies, her beautie made his soule captiue, she with a sword cut of his head. <sup>12</sup> The Persians did quake at her constancie, and the Medes at her boldnesse. <sup>13</sup> Then did the campe of the Assyrians howle, when my humble ones appeared, withering in thirst. <sup>14</sup> The sonnes of yongwemen haue pearced them, and they haue killed them as boyes fleing away: they haue perished in battel before the face of the Lord my God. <sup>15</sup> Let vs sing an hymne to our Lord, let vs sing a new hymne to our God.
