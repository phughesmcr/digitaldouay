<sup>6</sup> Mardocheus bowed not his knee unto him, nor adored him. (for he was angrie exceedingly, And he counted it a matter of nothing to lay his handes vpon Mardocheus alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Iewes, and he would rather destroy al the nation of the Iewes, that were in the kingdom of Assuerus. <sup>7</sup> The first moneth (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth yeare of the reigne of Assuerus, the lot was cast into a potte which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, in what day and what moneth the nation of the Iewes should be slayne: and there came forth the twelfth moneth, which is called Adar. <sup>8</sup> And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people dispersed through al the prouinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from an other, vsing new lawes and ceremonies, moreouer also contemning the kings ordinances: And thou knowest very wel that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they waxe insolent by libertie. <sup>9</sup> If it please thee, decree that they may perish, and I wil pay ten thousand talentes to the cofferers of thy treasure. <sup>10</sup> The king therfore tooke the ring that he vsed, from his hand, and gaue it to Aman the sonne of Amadathi of the progenie of Agag, the enemie of the Iewes, <sup>11</sup> and he said to him: The siluer which thou doest promise, be it thine: but concerning the people doe that which pleaseth thee. <sup>12</sup> And the kings scribes were called in the first moneth, Nisan, the thirteenth day of the same moneth: and there was written, as Aman had commanded, to al the kings lieutenantes, and iudges of the prouinces, and of diuers nations, as euerie nation could read, and heare according to the varietie of languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters signed with his ring, <sup>13</sup> were sent by the kings postes to al prouinces, that they should kil and destroy al the Iewes, from boy vnto old man, children, and women, in one day, that is, in the thirteenth of the twelfth moneth, which is called Adar, and should spoyle them of their goodes. <sup>14</sup> And the content of the letters was this, that al prouinces might know, & prepare them selues against the day aforesayd. <sup>15</sup> The postes that were sent, made hast to fulfil the kings commandment. And immediatly the edict hong in Susan, the king and Aman feasting, and al the Iewes that were in the citie, weeping.
