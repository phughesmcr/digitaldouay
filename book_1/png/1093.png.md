of Iob.

<sup>24</sup> The earth is geuen into the handes of the impious, he couereth the face of the iudges therof: and if it be not he, who is it then? <sup>25</sup> My dayes haue bene swifter then a poste: they haue fled and haue not sene good. <sup>26</sup> They haue passed by as shippes carying fruites, as an eagle flying to meate. <sup>27</sup> When I shal say: I wil not speake so, I change my face, and am tormented with sorow. <sup>28</sup> I feared al my wor- kes, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender. <sup>29</sup> But if so also I am impious, why haue I laboured in vayne? <sup>30</sup> If I be washed as it were with snow waters, and my handes shal shine as most cleane: <sup>31</sup> Yet shalt thou dippe me in filth, and my garmentes shal abhorre me. <sup>32</sup> For neither I wil answer a man that is like my self: nor that may be heard with me equally in iudgement. <sup>33</sup> There is none that may be able to reproue both, and to put his hand betwen both. <sup>34</sup> Let him take his rod from me, and let not his dread terrifie me. <sup>35</sup> I wil speake, and wil not feare him: for I can not answer fearing.

<sup>1</sup> MY soule is wearie of my life, I willet my speach passe agaynst my self. I wil speake in the bitternes of my soule. <sup>2</sup> I wil say to God: Condemne me not: tel me why thou iudgest me so. <sup>3</sup> Doth it seeme good to thee, if thou calumniate me, and oppresse me the worke of thy handes, and helpe the counsel of the impious? <sup>4</sup> Hast thou eies of flesh: or as a man seeth, shalt thou also see? <sup>5</sup> Are thy daies as the daies of man, and are thy yeares as the times of men: <sup>6</sup> That thou sekest my iniquitie, and searchest my sinne? <sup>7</sup> And thou mayst knowe that I haue done no impious thing, where as there is no man that can deliuer out of thy hand. <sup>8</sup> Thy handes haue made me, and framed me wholly round about, and dost thou so sodenly cast me downe headlong? <sup>9</sup> Remember I besech thee that as clay thou madest me, and into dust thou wilt bring me agayne. <sup>10</sup> Hast thou not as milke milked me, and curded me as cheese? <sup>11</sup> With skinne and flesh thou hast clothed me: with bones & sinowes thou hast compacted me. <sup>12</sup> Life and mercie thou hast geuen to me, and
