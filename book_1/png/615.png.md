Samuel. Saul. OF KINGES, 595

<sup>21</sup> but serue our Lord in al your hart. And decline not after vaine thinges, which shal not profite you, nor deliuer you, because they are vaine. <sup>22</sup> And our Lord wil not forsake his people for his great name: because our Lord hath sworne to make you a people to him self. <sup>23</sup> And farre from me be this sinne in our Lord, that I should cease to pray for you, and I wil teach you the good and right way. <sup>24</sup> Therefore feare our Lord, and serue him in truth and from your whole hart, for you haue seene the great workes which he hath done among you. <sup>25</sup> But if you shal perseuer in malice: both you and your king shal perish together.

<aside>fore Gods face were presumption, not to come to his backe, or to depart from thence, were desperation. So Marie Magdalen with feare and hope approched & taried at Christs backe: *Luc. 7. S. Greg. hom. citata.*</aside>

Which when the Philisthijms had heard, Saul sounded with the trumpet in al the land, saying: Let the Hebrewes heare. <sup>4</sup> And al Israel heard this maner of bruite: Saul hath striken the garri-son of the Philisthijms: and Israel tooke courage against the Philisthijms. The people therfore cried after Saul in Galgal. <sup>5</sup> And the Philisthims were gathered together to fight against Israel, thirtie thousand chariotes, and six thousand horsemen, and the rest of the common people, as the sand which is in the sea shore very much. And going vp they camped in Machmas at the East of Bethauen. <sup>6</sup> Which when the men of Israel had seene them selues put in a streict (for the people was af-flicted) they hid them selues in caues, and in secrete places, in rockes also, and in dennes, and in cesternes. <sup>7</sup> And the Hebrewes
