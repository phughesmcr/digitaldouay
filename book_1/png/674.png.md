noone, and walked in the toppe of the kinges house: and he
saw a woman washing her self, ouer against the roofe of his
house: and the woman was very beautiful. <sup>3</sup> The king there-
fore sent, and inquired what woman it was. And it was told
him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife
of Vrias the Hetheite. <sup>4</sup> Dauid therefore sending messengers,
tooke her, who when she was entered in to him, he slept
with her: and forthwith she was sanctified from her vnclen-
nes: <sup>5</sup> and she returned into her house hauing conceiued
a childe. And sending she told Dauid, and sayd: I haue con-
ceiued. <sup>6</sup> And Dauid sent to Ioab, saying: Send me Vrias the
Hetheite. And Ioab sent Vrias to Dauid. <sup>7</sup> And Vrias came
to Dauid. And Dauid asked how wel Ioab did, & the people,
and how the warre was ordered. <sup>8</sup> And Dauid sayd to Vrias:
Goe into thy house, and wash thy feete. And Vrias went forth
out of the kinges house, and the kinges meate folowed him.
<sup>9</sup> But Vrias slept before the gate of the kinges house, with
the other seruantes of his lord, and went not downe to his
owne house. <sup>10</sup> And it was told Dauid of them that sayd:
Vrias went not into his house. And Dauid sayd to Vrias: didst
thou not come from thy iourney? Why didst thou not goe
downe into thy house? <sup>11</sup> And Vrias sayd to Dauid: The Arke
of God and Israel and Iuda dwel in pauilions, & my lord Ioab
and the seruantes of my lord abide vpon the face of the earth:
and shal I enter into my house, to eate and to drinke, and
sleepe with my wife? by thy health, and by the health of thy
soule I wil not do this thing. <sup>12</sup> Dauid therefore sayd to Vrias:
Tarie here also this day, and to morow I wil dismisse thee.
Vrias taried in Ierusalem that day and the next: <sup>13</sup> and Dauid
called him to eate before him and to drinke, and he made him
drunke: who going out at euen, slept on his couche with the
seruantes of his lord, and went not downe into his house.
<sup>14</sup> The morning therefore was come, and Dauid wrote a
letter to Ioab: and sent it by the hand of Vrias, <sup>15</sup> writing in
the letter: Sette ye Vrias in the front of the battel, where the
fight is strongest: and leaue him, that being striken he may
die. <sup>16</sup> Therefore when Ioab besieged the citie, he put Vrias
in the place where he knew the strongest men were. <sup>17</sup> And
the men issuing out of the citie, fought against Ioab, and
there fel of the people of the seruantes of Dauid, and Vrias
also the Hetheite died. <sup>18</sup> Ioab therefore sent, and told Dauid
