spake vnto him for Adonias: and the king arose to meete her,
and adored her, and sate downe vpon his throne: and a throne
was sette for the kinges mother, who sate on his right hand.
<sup>20</sup> And she said to him: One litle petition I desire of thee, con-
found not my face. And the king said to her: My mother aske:
for it behoueth not that I turne away thy face. <sup>21</sup> Who said:
Let Abisag the Sunamite be geuen to Adonias thy brother to
wife. <sup>22</sup> And king Salomon answered, and said to his mother:
Why doest thou aske Abisag the Sunamite for Adonias? aske
for him also the kingdom: for he is my brother elder then I, &
hath Abiathar the priest, & Ioab the sonne of Saruia. <sup>23</sup> Ther-
fore king Salomon sware by our Lord, saying: These thinges
doe God to me, and these adde he, because Adonias hath
spoken this word against his life. <sup>24</sup> And now, our Lord liueth
which hath established me, and placed me vpon the throne of
Dauid my father, and which hath made me a house, as he
spake, this day shal Adonias be slaine. <sup>25</sup> And king Salomon
sent by the hand of Banaias the sonne of Ioiada, who slewe
him, and he died. <sup>26</sup> To Abiathar also the priest the king said:
Goe into Anathoth to thy field, and thou in deede art a man
of death: but to day I wil not kil thee, because thou didst carie
the arke of our Lord God before Dauid my father, & hast su-
steyned labour in al thinges, wherein my father laboured.
<sup>27</sup> Salomon therefore cast out Abiathar, that he should not
be the priest of our Lord, that the word of our Lord might
be fulfilled, which he spake concerning the house of Heli in
Silo. <sup>28</sup> And then a messenger came to Ioab for that Ioab had
turned after Adonias, and after Salomon had not turned:
Ioab therfore fled into the tabernacle of our Lord, & caught
the horne of the altar. <sup>29</sup> And it was told king Salomon, that
Ioab was fled into the tabernacle of our Lord, and was beside
the altar: & Salomon sent Banaias the sonne of Ioiada, saying:
Goe, kil him. <sup>30</sup> And Banaias came to the tabernacle of our
Lord, and said to him: Thus sayth the king: Come forth.
Who said: I wil not come forth, but here wil I die. Banaias
reported his word to the king, saying: Thus spake Ioab, and
thus he answered me. <sup>31</sup> And the king said to him: Doe as he
hath spoken: and kil him, & burie him, and thou shalt remoue
the innocent bloud, which hath beene shed of Ioab, from me,
and from the house of my father. <sup>32</sup> And our Lord shal render
his bloud vpon his head, because he murdered two iust men, &
