# IOSVE.

## CHAP. IIII.

In memorie of their miraculous passage, twelue chief men, of the twelue
tribes, take so manie great stones from the middes of Iordan, 9. and put other twelue, where the priestes stood with the arke. 18. The waters returne
to their former course. And the twelue stones are erected for a monument.

WHO being passed ouer, our Lord said to Iosue: <sup>1</sup>
Choose twelue men one in euerie tribe: <sup>2</sup> and
command them that they take vp out of the middes of the
chanel of Iordan, where the feete of the priestes stoode, twelue
most hard stones, which you shal put in the place of the
campe, where you shal pitch tentes this night: <sup>4</sup> And Iosue
called twelue men, whom he had chosen out of the children
of Israel, one of euerie tribe, <sup>5</sup> and he said to them: Goe
before the arke of our Lord your God to the middes of Iordan, and carrie from thence euerie man a stone on your
shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,
<sup>6</sup> that it may be a signe among you: and when your children shal aske you to morrow, saying: What meane these
stones? <sup>7</sup> You shal answer them: The waters of Iordan decayed before the arke of the couenant of our Lord, when
it passed ouer the same: therfore were these stones sette for
a monument of the children of Israel for euer. <sup>8</sup> The children of Israel therfore did as Iosue commanded them, carying out of the chanel of Iordan twelue stones, as our Lord
had commanded him, according to the number of the children of Israel, vnto the place, wherein they camped, and there
they sette them. <sup>9</sup> Other twelue stones also Iosue put in
the middes of the chanel of Iordan, where the priestes
stoode, that caried the arke of the couenant: and they be
there vntil this present day. <sup>10</sup> But the priestes that caried
the arke, stoode in the middes of Iordan, til al thinges were
accomplished, which our Lord had commanded Iosue, to
speake to the people, and Moyses had said to him. And the
people made hast, and passed ouer. <sup>11</sup> And when they had al
passed ouer, the arke also of our Lord passed ouer, the priestes
also went before the people. <sup>12</sup> The children of Ruben also
and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, went armed before
the children of Israel, as Moyses had commanded them:
<sup>13</sup> and fourtie thousand fighting men by troupes, and bandes,
marched
