Of Ioas. Eliseus dieth. OF KINGES. 789

to him, and wept before him, and sayd: My father, my father,
<sup>15</sup> the chariote of Israel and the garder therof. <sup>16</sup> And Eliseus
sayd to him: fetch a bow and arrowes. And when he had
brought him a bow, and arrowes, <sup>16</sup> he sayd to the king of
Israel: Put thy hand vpon the bow. And when he had put
<sup>17</sup> his hand, Eliseus put his handes ouer the kinges handes, <sup>17</sup> and
sayd: Open the east window. And when he had opened it,
Eliseus sayd: Shote an arrow. And he shot. And Eliseus sayd:
The arrow of the saluation of our Lord, and the arrow of
saluation agaynst Syria: and thou shalt strike Syria in Aphec,
<sup>18</sup> til thou consume it. <sup>18</sup> And he sayd: Take vp the arrowes.
Who when he had taken them agayne, he sayd to him: Strike
the earth with a iauelin. And when he had striken three ti-
<sup>19</sup> mes, and stood stil, <sup>19</sup> the man of God was angrie with him,
& sayd: If thou hadst striken fiue or six or seuen times, thou
hadst striken Syria euen to destruction: but now three times
<sup>20</sup> shalt thou strike it. <sup>20</sup> Eliseus therfore died, and they buried
him. And the rouers of Moab came into the land the same
<sup>21</sup> yeare. <sup>21</sup> And certayne persons burying a man, saw the ro-
uers, and threw the bodie in the sepulchre of Eliseus. Which
when it had touched the bones of Eliseus, the man reuiued,
<sup>22</sup> and stood vpon his feete. <sup>22</sup> Hazael therefore the king of Syria
<sup>23</sup> afflicted Israel al the daies of Ioachaz: <sup>23</sup> and our Lord had
mercie on them, and returned to them for his couenant,
which he had with Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob: and he
would not destroy them, nor vtterly cast them away, vntil
<sup>24</sup> this present time. <sup>24</sup> And Hazael the king of Syria died, and
<sup>25</sup> Benadad his sonne reigned for him. <sup>25</sup> Moreouer Ioas the
sonne of Ioachaz, tooke the cities out of the hand of Bena-
dad the sonne of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand
of Ioachaz his father by the right of warre, three times did
Ioas strike him, and he deliuered the cities to Israel.

CHAP. XIIII.

*Amasias king of Iuda killeth those that had slaine his father:7. and striketh
Edom. 8. Prouoking Ioas king of Israel to warre, receiueth a contem-
tible answer: 11. prouoking againe is beaten in battle, and Ierusalem is
ransakt. 15. Ioas dieth and his sonne Ieroboam foloweth the bad steppes
of the first Ieroboam; yet recoucreth manie places lost before. And dying
his sonne Zacharias reigneth.*

[^1]: It was reue-
led to the pro-
phet that so
often as the
king should
strike the
earth, so often
he should
haue victories
against the Sy-
rians, but not
how often he
would strike
on the earth.
