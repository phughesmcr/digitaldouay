<sup>8</sup> But he forsook the counsel of the Ancients, and began to treat with yongmen, that had beene brought vp with him, and were in his trayne. <sup>9</sup> And he sayd to them: What semeth to you? or what shal I answer this people, which hath sayd to me: Ease the yoke which thy father layd vpon vs? <sup>10</sup> But they answered as yongmen, and brought vp with him in delicateness, and sayd: Thus shalt thou speake to the people, that sayd to thee: Thy father aggrauated our yoke, doe thou ease it: and thus shalt thou answer them: My least finger is thicker then the loynes of my father. <sup>11</sup> My father layd vpon yow an heauie yoke, and I wil adde a greater weight: my father bette you with scourges, but I wil beate you with scorpions. <sup>12</sup> Ieroboam therfore came, and al the people to Roboam the third day, as he had commanded them. <sup>13</sup> And the king answered rough wordes, leauing the counsel of the Ancientes: <sup>14</sup> and he spake according to the yongmens wil: My father layd vpon you a heauie yoke, which I wil make heauier: my father bette you with scourges, but I wil beate you with scorpions. <sup>15</sup> And he condescended not to the peoples requestes: for it was the wil of God, that his word should be accomplished, which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat. <sup>16</sup> And al the people when the king spake rough wordes, sayd thus vnto him: We haue no part in Dauid, nor inheritance in the sonne of Isai. Returne into thy tabernacles Ã´ Israel, and do thou feede thy house Dauid. And Israel went into their tabernacles. <sup>17</sup> But ouer the children of Israel, that dwelt in the cities of Iuda, Roboam reigned. <sup>18</sup> And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was ouer the tributes, and the children of Israel stoned him, and he died: moreouer king Roboam made hast to get vp into his chariote, and fled into Ierusalem. <sup>19</sup> And Israel reuolted from the house of Dauid vntil this day.

CHAP. XI.

*Roboam intending by force to reduce al Israel to his subiection, is warned by a Prophet to cease from that enterprise. 5. He maketh walles about diuers cities. 11. furnisheth them with victuals, and munition. 13. Priestes, Leuites, and manie others repaire to Ierusalem, because Ieroboam maketh a new religion, and new priestes. 18. Roboam taketh manie wiues, and concubines. 22. preferreth Abias aboue al his other sonnes.*
