man, God may be pacified toward him: but if a man shal sinne against our Lord: who shal pray for him? And they heard not the voice of their father, because our Lord would kil them. <sup>26</sup> But the childe Samuel prospered, and grew, and pleased both our Lord and men. <sup>27</sup> And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus sayth our Lord: Was not I openly reueled to thy fathers house, when they were in Ã†gypt in the house of Pharao? <sup>28</sup> and I chose him of al the tribes of Israel for my priest, that he might ascend to my altar, and burne to me incense, and might carie the ephod before me: and I gaue to thy fathers house al thinges of the sacrifices of the children of Israel. <sup>29</sup> Why haue you with your heele reiected my victime, and my giftes which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and hast rather honoured thy sonnes then me, that you would eate the first fruites of euerie sacrifice of Israel my people? <sup>30</sup> Therfore sayeth our Lord the God of Israel: Speaking I spake that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for euer. But now sayeth our Lord: Be this farre from me: but whosoeuer shal glorifie me I wil glorifie him: and they that contemne me, shal be base. <sup>31</sup> Behold the daies come: and I wil cut of thy arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, that there may not be an old man in thy house. <sup>32</sup> And thou shalt see thy emule in the temple, in al prosperities of Israel and there shal not be an old man in thy house for euer. <sup>33</sup> Notwithstanding I wil not altogether take away a man of thee from myn altar: but that thyne eyes may fayle, and thy soule melt: and a great part of thy house shal die when it is come to mans age. <sup>34</sup> And this shal be a signe to thee, which shal come vpon thy two sonnes, Ophni, and Phinees: In one day they shal both die. <sup>35</sup> And I wil rayse vp vnto me a faithful priest, which shal doe according to my hart, and my soule: and I wil build him a faythful house, and he shal walke before my Christ al daies. <sup>36</sup> And it shal come to passe, that whosoeuer shal remayne in thy house, shal come that he may be prayed for, and shal offer a peece of siluer, and a manchet of bread, and shal say: Leaue me I beseech thee to one priestly part, that I may eate a morsel of bread.

<aside>Sinnes directly against God, and that hinder his seruice, are more hardly remitted: but none at al are irremissible before death, because during life euerie one may truly repent if he wil: and to al true penitentes God promisseth remission of sinnes Ezech. 33. v. 14. Gods determination to punish tooke not away their freewil, but for their obstinatie he lefte them to them selues, without his grace, and so iustly punished them. Ste S. Aug. li. 5. cont. Iulian. c. 3.</aside>
