# Esther
## Chapter XIII

A copie of the epistle which Aman sent to al prouinces to destroy the Iewes. And Mardocheus his prayer for the people.

<sup>1</sup> And this was the copie of the letter. The most great king Artaxerxes from India vnto Ã†thiopia, to the princes of an hundred and seuen and twentie prouinces, and to the captaynes, that are subiect to his empire, greeting. <sup>2</sup> Wheras I reigned ouer manie nations, and had subdewed al the world to my dominion, I would not abuse the greatnes of my might, but with clemencie and lenitie gouerne my subiectes, that passing their life quietly without any terrour, they might enioy peace wished of al men. <sup>3</sup> But when I demanded of my counselers how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisedom and fidelitie, and was second after the king, Aman by name, <sup>4</sup> told me that there was a people dispersed through the whole world, which vsed new lawes, and doing against the customes of al Nations, contemned the comandmentes of kings, and brake the concord of al nations by their dissention. <sup>5</sup> Which when we had learned, seing one nation rebellious against al kind of men to vse peruerse lawes, and to goe against our commandmentes, and to disturbe the peace and concord of the prouinces subiect to vs, <sup>6</sup> we haue commanded that whomsoever Aman shal shew, who is chiefe ouer al the prouinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour in steed of a father, they with their wiues and children be destroyed of their enemies, and that none haue pitie on them the fourteenth day of the twelfth moneth Adar of this present yeare: <sup>7</sup> that the wicked men going downe to hel in one day, may restore the peace to our empire, which they had disturbed.
