ESTHER.

the greatest, and alwayes louing God, by whose benefite the
kingdom was geuen both to our fathers and to vs, and is kept
vnto this day. <sup>17</sup> Wherfore know ye those letters, which he
directed in our name, to be of none effect. <sup>18</sup> For the which
heinous fact, before the gates of this citie, that is, of Susan,
both him self that deuised it, and al his kinred hang on gibbettes: not we, but God repaying him that which he hath
deserued. <sup>19</sup> But this edict, which we now send, let it be set
forth in al cities, that it be lawful for the Iewes to vse their
owne lawes. <sup>20</sup> Whom you must helpe, that those, which had
prepared them selues to their slaughter, they may kil the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth, which is called Adar. <sup>21</sup> For
God omnipotent hath turned this day of sadnes and mourning into ioy to them. <sup>22</sup> Wherfore :: count you also this day
among other festiual daies, and celebrate it with al ioy, that
hereafter also it may be knowne, <sup>23</sup> that al, which faithfully
obey the Persians, receiue worthie reward for their fidelitie:
and they that lie in wayte against their kingdom, perish for
their wicked fact. <sup>24</sup> And euerie prouince and citie, that wil
not be partaker of this solemnitie, let it perish by sword and
fyre, and let it so be destroyed, that not onlie men, but also
beastes haue no accesse therto for euer, for an example of
contempt, and disobedience.*

THE ARGVMENT OF THE
BOOKE OF IOB.

Holie Iob otherwise called Iobab (Gen. 36.) as S. Augustin, S. Chrisostom, S. Ambrose, S. Gregorie, and other fathers teach, the sonne
of Zara, the sonne of Rahuel, the sonne of Esau, was king (or absolute prince) of the land of Hus. Who being perfect in religion, sincere in life,
rich in wealth, and blessed with children, for an admirable example of patience, and to shew that a mortal man through Gods grace, may resist al the
diuels tentations, by Gods permission, sudainly lost al his goodes and children,
was striken with horrible sores in al his bodie, reuiled by his wife, and in steed
of comforth which his special freindes pretended towards him, was iniuriously charged by them, with impatience, arrogancie, blasphemie, and other
crimes, for which they falsly supposed he was so afflicted, affirming, and by
diuerse sophistical argumentes, grounded as they pretended vpon Gods iustice,
wisdome, power, mercie, and goodnes, would proue that God suffereth none
but wicked men to be so afflicted. But Iob constantly defendeth his owne iust
innocencie, and that worldlie calamities, and prosperitie happen indifferently
