to the house of our Lord in Ierusalem, and should make a
<sup>2</sup> Phase to our Lord the God of Israel. Counsel therfore
being taken of the king and the princes, and of al the assem-
blie of Ierusalem, they decreed to make the Phase the second
<sup>3</sup> moneth. For they could not make it in his time: because
the Priestes that might suffise, had not bene sanctified, and the
<sup>4</sup> people had not as yet bene gathered into Ierusalem. And
<sup>5</sup> the word pleased the king, and al the multitude. And they
decreed to send messengers into al Israel from Bersabee vnto
dan, that they should come, and make the Phase to our Lord
the God of Israel in Ierusalem: for manie had not made it as
<sup>6</sup> is prescribed by the law. And the postes went forth with
letters of commandement from the king, and his princes,
into al Israel and Iuda, according to that, which the king had
commanded, proclaming: Children of Israel returne ye

<sup>12</sup> of Aser, and Manasses, and Zabulon, condescending to the
counsel, came to Ierusalem. But the hand of God was in
Iuda, to geue them one hart to doe the word of our Lord,
<sup>13</sup> according to the precept of the king and of the princes.
And much people was gathered into Ierusalem to make
<sup>14</sup> the solemnitie of Azimes in the second moneth: And
rising they destroyed the alters that were in Ierusalem, and
ouerthrowing al thinges wherin incense was burnt to idols,
