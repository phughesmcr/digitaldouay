<sup>26</sup> wil geue him his daughter, and he wil make his fathers house without tribute in Israel. And Dauid spake to the men that stood with him, saying: What shal be geuen to the man that shal beate this Philistian, and shal take away the reproch from Israel? For who is this vncircumcised Philistian, which hath vpbraided the armies of the liuing God?

<sup>27</sup> And the people reported vnto him the self same worde, saying: These thinges shal be geuen to the man, that shal strike him. <sup>28</sup> Which when Eliab his eldest brother had heard, when he spake with others, he was angrie against Dauid, and sayd: Wherefore camest thou? and why hast thou left those few sheepe in the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickednes of thy hart: that to see the battel thou art come downe.

<sup>29</sup> And Dauid sayd: What haue I done? is there not cause to speake? <sup>30</sup> And he went a litle aside from him to an other: and sayd the self same word. And the people answered him as before. <sup>31</sup> And the wordes which Dauid spake were heard, and told in the sight of Saul. <sup>32</sup> To whom when he was brought, he spake vnto him: Let not any mans hart be discouraged in him: I thy seruant wil goe, and wil fight against the Philistian.

<sup>33</sup> And Saul sayd to Dauid: Thou art not able to resist this Philistian, nor to fight against him, because thou art a childe, but he is a man of warre from his youth. <sup>34</sup> And Dauid sayd to Saul: Thy seruant did feede his fathers flocke, and there came a lyon, or a beare, and tooke a ramme out of the middes of the flocke: <sup>35</sup> and I pursued them, and stroke them, and plucked them out of their mouth, and they arose vp against me, and I caught their chinne, and I strangled and slew them. <sup>36</sup> For both the lyon and the beare did I thy seruant kil: therefore this vncircumcised Philistian also, shal be as it were one of them. Now wil I goe and take away the reproch of the people: for who is this vncircumcised Philistian, which hath beene so hardie to curse the host of the liuing God?

<sup>37</sup> And Dauid sayd: Our Lord which hath deliuered me from the hand of the lion, and of the beare, he wil deliuer me from the hand of this Philistian. And Saul sayd to Dauid: Goe, and our Lord be with thee. <sup>38</sup> And Saul clothed Dauid with his rayments, and put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and vested him with a coate of maile. <sup>39</sup> Dauid therefore being girded with his sword ouer his rayment, beganne to proue if he could goe armed: for he was not accustomed.

<aside>He that hath ouercome the spirit of pride, and of carnalitie (signified by a lion, and a beare) is able also to ouercome the duel.</aside>
