Angel of God, so is my lord the king, that he is moued neither
with blessing nor cursing: Wherefore our Lord also thy God
is with thee. <sup>18</sup> And the king answering, sayd to the woman:
Hide not from me the thing that I aske thee. And the woman
sayd to him: Speake my lord king. <sup>19</sup> And the king sayd: Is
the hand of Ioab with thee in al these thinges? The woman
answered, and sayd: By the health of thy soule, my lord king,
it is neither on the left hand, nor on the right of al these
thinges, which my lord the king hath spoken: for thy seruant
Ioab, he commanded me, and he put al these wordes into the
mouth of thy handmayde. <sup>20</sup> That I should change the forme
of this speach, thy seruant Ioab commanded this: and thou
my lord king, art wise, as an Angel of God hath wisdom, that
thou vnderstandest al thinges vpon the earth. <sup>21</sup> And the king
sayd to Ioab: Behold I being pacified haue done thy word:
Goe therefore, and cal agayne the boy Absalom. <sup>22</sup> And Ioab
falling vpon his face vnto the earth, adored, and blessed the
king: and Ioab sayd: This day thy seruant hath vnderstood,
that I haue found grace in thy sight my lord king: for thou
hast done the word of thy seruant. <sup>23</sup> Ioab therefore arose
and went into Gessur, and brought Absalom into Ierusalem.
<sup>24</sup> But the king sayd: Let him returne into his house, and not
see my face. Absalom therefore returned into his house, and
the kings face he saw not. <sup>25</sup> Moreouer like as Absalom, there
was not a man in al Israel so beautiful, and exceeding comelie:
from the sole of the foote to the crowne there was no ble-
mish in him. <sup>26</sup> And when he powled his heare (once a yeare
he was powled, because his bush did burden him) he weighed
the heare of his head at two hundred sicles, of the common
weight. <sup>27</sup> And there were borne to Absalom three son-
nes: and one daughter, named Thamar, of a goodly beautie.
<sup>28</sup> And Absalom abode in Ierusalem two yeares, and saw not
the kinges face. <sup>29</sup> He therefore sent to Ioab, to send him to
the king: who would not come to him. And when he had
sent the second time, and he would not come to him, <sup>30</sup> he
sayd to his seruantes: You know the filde of Ioab beside my
filde, that hath barley haruest: goe therefore and burne it
with fyre. The seruantes therefore of Absalom burnt the
corne with fyre. And Ioabs seruantes coming, renting their
garmentes, sayd: The seruantes of Absalom haue burnt part
of the filde with fyre. <sup>31</sup> And Ioab arose, & came to Absalom
