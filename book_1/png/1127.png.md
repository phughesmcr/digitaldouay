OF IOB, 1109

mathite went, and did as our Lord had spoken to them, and our Lord received the face of Iob. <sup>10</sup> Our Lord also was turned at the penance of Iob, when he prayed for his freindes. And our Lord added al thinges whatsoever had bene Iobes, duble. <sup>11</sup> And al his brethren came to him, and al his sisters, and al that knew him before, and they did eate bread with him in his house: and wagged the head vpon him, and comforted him vpon al the euil that God had brought in vpon him. And euerie man gaue him one ewe, and one earelet of gold. <sup>12</sup> And our Lord blessed the last daies of Iob more then his beginning. And he had fourtene thousand sheepe, and six thousand camels, & a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. <sup>13</sup> And he had seuen sonnes, and three daughters. <sup>14</sup> And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, & the name of the third Cornustibij. <sup>15</sup> And there were not found in al the earth wemen so beautiful as the daughters of Iob: and their father gaue them inheritance among their brethren. <sup>16</sup> And Iob liued after these thinges, an hundred fourtie yeares, and he saw his children, and his childrens children, vnto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and ful of daies.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XLII.

[^1]: Iob haue not spoken right, as my seruant Iob] Holie Iob being throughly tried God by his in the fornace of tribulation, and by diuine instruction confirmed in perfect sentence con-patience, and other vertues, God at last gaue sentence, condemning the guiltie, demned the and iustifying the innocent: in plaine termes pronouncing that Eliphaz, Baldad, error of Iobs and Sophar had not spoken right before him, as his seruant Iob. And so these freindes, and three being conuinced, that notwithstanding their former pretence of defen- iustified his ding Gods cause, they had erred, and Iob had maintained the truth, they sub- assertion. mitted themselues as faultie, and humbly did penance, bringing their oblations for sacrifice to Iob, as they were commanded. v. 8 &c.9

<aside>:: Iob did penance both for himself and others. :: In that he had al other thinges duble, and children in the same number as before, it is a signe that the former perished not but died in good state:</aside>

As for Eliu the last disputer, persisting more vehement in his errour when others ceased from contention, he was sufficiently condemned in his felowes. And therefore for that true point of his owne doctrine (ch.33. v.14) that God spea- keth once, and repeateth not the same, the second time. For it was euer a general rule, Error ought that when God once reueiled anie thing by publique fact, or vnto competent not to be hol-witnesses, it sufficed for euer, to al reasonable men; and so Eliu might applie den stil, being the sentence to himselfe, which God had denounced to his three freindes, in once condem-the same cause. Much lesse are Protestantes excusable, which not only persist ned. in errors condemned in their owne felowes, as in Luther, Caluin, Beza & others, Much lesse but also in other old heretikes: as their doctrine of iustification by only faith, iustly againe condemned in the Apostles time: their denying the ceremonies of Baptisme, being hereto-the Sacramentes of Confirmation: of Penance, condemned in the Nouatians: fore buried.
