<sup>11</sup> moneth, in the fifteenth yeare of the reigne of Asa, they
immolated to our Lord in that day of the spoiles, & the praie,
that they had brought, oxen seuen hundred, and rammes
<sup>12</sup> seuen thousand. And he went in after the maner to establish
the couenant, that they should seeke our Lord the God of
<sup>13</sup> their fathers in al their hart, and in al their soul. And if anie
man, quoth he, shal not seeke our Lord the God of Israel, let
him die, from the least to the greatest, from man vnto wo-
<sup>14</sup> man. And they sware to our Lord with a lowd voyce in
iubilation, and in noyse of trumpet, and sound of shaulmes,
<sup>15</sup> al that were in Iuda with execration: for in al their hart did
they sweare, and with al their wil did they seeke him, and
<sup>16</sup> found him, & our Lord gaue them rest round about. Yea and
Maacha the mother of king Asa he deposed from the royal
empyre, because she had made in a groue the idol of Priapus:
which he wholy destroyed, and breaking into peeces, burnt
<sup>17</sup> it in the Torrent cedron. But the Excelses were leaft in
<sup>18</sup> Israel: neuerthelesse the hart of Asa was perfect al his daies.
And those thinges which his father had vowed, and him
self, he brought into the house of our Lord, gold and siluer,
<sup>19</sup> and of vessels diuers furniture. And there was no warre
vnto the fiue and thirteth yeare of the reigne of Asa.

Baasa the king of Israel into Iuda, and with a wall com-

kinges treasures, and he sent to Benadad the king of Syria,

me & thee, my father also and thy father had concord, wher-
fore I haue sent thee siluer and gold, that breaking the league,
which thou hast with Baasa the king of Israel, thou make
<sup>4</sup> him retire from me. Which being knowen, Benadad sent
the princes of his hostes to the cities of Israel: who stroke
Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and al the walled cities of
<sup>5</sup> Nephthali. which when Baasa had heard, he ceased to build
