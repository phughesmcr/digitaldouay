<sup>2</sup> Which when Ezechias had sene, to witte, that Sennacherib was come, and the whole force of the battel to be turned agaynst Ierusalem, <sup>3</sup> taking counsel with the princes, and the most valiant men, to stoppe vp the heades of the fountaynes, that were without the citie: and the sentence of them al decreing this, <sup>4</sup> he gathered a very great multitude, & they stopped vp al the fountaynes, and the riuer, that ranne in the middes of the land, saying: Lest the kinges of the Assyrians come, and finde abundance of waters. <sup>5</sup> He built also doing industriously euerie wall that had bene destroyed, and built towers vpon them, and an other wall without: and he repayred Mello in the citie of Dauid, and made armour and shildes of al sortes: <sup>6</sup> And he appointed princes of warryers in the armie: and he called them al together in the streate of the gate of the citie, and spake to their hart, saying: <sup>7</sup> Doe manfully, and take courage: feare not, neither dread ye the king of the Assyrians, and al the multitude, that is with him: for there are manie moe with vs, then with him. <sup>8</sup> For with him is an arme of flesh: with vs the Lord our God, which is our helper, and fighteth for vs. And the people was encouraged with these maner of wordes of Ezechias the king of Iuda. <sup>9</sup> Which thinges after they were done, Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians sent his seruantes to Ierusalem (for himself with al his armie besieged Lachis) to Ezechias the king of Iuda, & to al the people, that was in the citie, saying: <sup>10</sup> Thus sayth Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians: In whom hauing affiance, doe you sitte besieged in Ierusalem? <sup>11</sup> Hath Ezechias deceiued you, to deliuer you to death in hunger and thirst, affirming that the Lord your God can deliuer you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians? <sup>12</sup> Why, is not this Ezechias, that hath destroyed his excelses, and altars, and hath commanded Iuda & Ierusalem, saying: Before one altar you shal adore, and on it you shal burne incense? <sup>13</sup> Are you ignorant what thinges I haue done, and my fathers to al the peoples of the landes? haue the goddes of nations, and of al landes bene able to deliuer their countrie out of my hand? <sup>14</sup> Who is there of al the goddes of the nations, which my fathers wasted, that could deliuer his people out of my hand, that your God also can deliuer you out of this hand? <sup>15</sup> Let not therfore Ezechias deceiue you, nor delude you
