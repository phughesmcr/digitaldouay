Salomon: OF KINGES. 709

almost extirpate, for not punishing certaine malefactours. Iudic. 20. And the whole people were often inuaded & sore afflicted for their sinnes: as appeareth in the booke of Iudges: In particular also diuers were aduanced & prospered for their vertues, as Iosue, Caleb, Phinees, Samuel, Dauid and others. Contrariwise Nadab and Abiu priests were miraculously burnt for offering strange fire, Le. u. 10. One stoned to death for gathering stickes on the sabbath day. Num. 15. King Saul deposed, for presuming to offer sacrifice, & not destroying Infidels (1. Reg. 13. 15.) & Oza, 2. Reg. 6. suddenly slaine for touching the Arke of God, the Law forbidding vnder paine of death, Num. 1. v. 51. & 18. v. 7. that none should approch to holie office being not thereunto duly called.

Of workes also of Supererogation (called counsailes not preceptes) we haue examples in vowes, voluntarily made of thinges not commanded; the law prescribing what vowes might be made, & by whom. Nu. 30. And Num. 6. a particular rule was proposed to such as of their owne accord, would embrace it, & a distinct name giuen them, to be called Nazarites, that is, Seperate or Sanctified. In which state they were to remaine either for a time, limited by themselues or their parents, or perpetually, if they so promised. Iudic. 13. 1. Reg. 1. For so farre as their promise extended, they were strictly obliged to performe. Deut. 23. When thou hast vowed a vow to our Lord thy God, thou shalt not slacke to pay it: because our Lord thy God wil require it: and if thou delay, it shal be reputed to thee for sinne. If thou wilt not promise, thou shalt be without (this) sinne. Pay thy vowes vnto the Highest, Psal. 75. Vow ye, and render (your vowes) to our Lord your God, Psal. 49. The Rechabites afterwards had a like rule to the Nazarites; & the same perpetual (Hierem. 35.) neuer to drinke wine, nor to build nor dwel in houses, but in tabernacles, nor sow corne, nor plant vineyardes. Which though instituted by a man, yet the obseruation thereof was much commended & rewarded by God. v. 19. Such distinct state of religious persons, with other states of the church of Christ, were also prefigured (Leuit. 11.) by the cleane fishes, of three distinct waters, as some holie Fathers do mystically expound that place. To witte, the cleane fishes of the sea are the multitude of lay persons, which are drawen out of the sea of this world, and happily found good fishes in our Lords nette. Math. 13. The cleane fishes of the riuers, are the good and fruitful Clergie men, that water the whole earth, by teaching Christian doctrine, and ministring holie Sacraments, with other Rites, and Gouerning the whole Church. And the cleane fishes of standing pooles, are the Monastical persons, liuing perpetually in Cloysters, where good soules are alwaies readie for our Lordes table, as S. Bernard teacheth. Much more the ancient fathers, S. Beda S. Gregorie, S. Augustine, and others explicate innumerable places of holie scripture mystically, relying therin
