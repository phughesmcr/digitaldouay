<sup>14</sup> And if thou wilt walke in my wayes, and keepe my preceptes, and my commandementes, as thy father walked, I wil make thy dayes long. <sup>15</sup> Therfore Salomon awaked, and perceiued that it was a dreame: and when he was come to Ierusalem, he stood before the arke of couenant of our Lord, and offered holocaustes, and made pacifique victimes, and a great feast to al his seruantes. <sup>16</sup> Then came there two women harlotes to the king, and stood before him: <sup>17</sup> of the which one said: I besech thee, my lord, I and this woman dwelt in one house, and I was deliuered of a childe beside her in the chamber. <sup>18</sup> And the third day, after that I was deliuered, she also was deliuered, and we were together, and no other person with vs in the house, except we two. <sup>19</sup> And this womans childe died in the night. For sleping she oppressed him. <sup>20</sup> And rysing in the dead tyme of the night, she tooke my childe from the side of me thy handmayd being aslepe, and layed it in her bosome: and her childe that was dead, she put in my bosome. <sup>21</sup> And when I was rysen in the morning to geue my childe milke, he appeared dead: whom more diligently beholding when it was cleere day, I found that it was not mine which I bare. <sup>22</sup> And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayest, but thy childe is dead, and mine liueth. On the contrarie part she sayd: Thou liest: for my childe liueth, and thy childe is dead. And in this maner they stroue before the king. <sup>23</sup> Then sayd the king: This woman saith, My childe liueth, and thy childe is dead. And this hath answered, No, but thy childe is dead, and mine liueth. <sup>24</sup> The king therfore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had brought a sword before the King, <sup>25</sup> Diuide, quoth he, the liuing child into two partes, and geue the halfe part to one, and halfe to the other. <sup>26</sup> But the woman, whose childe was aliue, said to the king (for her bowels were moued vpon her childe) I besech thee my lord, geue her the childe aliue, and kil it not. On the contrarie part she sayd: be it neither mine, nor thine, but let it be diuided. <sup>27</sup> The king answered, and said: Geue vnto this woman the infant aliue, and let it not be killed for this is the mother therof. <sup>28</sup> Al Israel therefore heard the iudgement that the king had iudged, and they feared the king, seing the wisedom of God to be in him to doe iudgement.
