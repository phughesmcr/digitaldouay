# THE CONTINVANCE OF THE CHVRCH, AND RELIGION, IN THE FIFTH AGE,

From the fundation of the Temple, to the cap-
tiuitie in Babylon. The space of 450., yeares.

<aside>The Church stil visible, and the same faith as before.</aside>

ALBEIT *there were greater schismes, Heresies, and more reuoltes from Gods law and seruice in this fifth age, then in the former: Yet the true Church and Religion continued stil, and were no lesse conspicuous then before. Which being clere and euident, touching manie principal Articles, we wil hereonly remitte the reader to some special places, for confirmation therof: neither wil we be prolixe, in declaring other pointes: denied, or called into controuersie at this time, by the impugners of Catholique Religion.*

<aside>One God:</aside>

Beleefe in one God appeareth plainly in building, adorning, & dedicating the Temple with so great solemnitie of the Priestes, Leuites, and al the Tribes, and particularly by king Salomons prayer. 3. Reg. 7. & 8. 2. Paral. 2. &c. Also Prouerb. 8. Eccle. 12. Isaie. 41. 44. 45.

<aside>Three Persons Christ.</aside>

The Mysterie of the B. Trinitie, Prouer. 12. Isaie. 6. 48. 49. Ose. 11. Ioel. 2. Of Christ our Redemer. Isaie. 7. 8. 9. 11. 28. 53. Ierem. 23. 30. 33. Ezech. 17. 34. 37. Dan. 7. 9. Osee. 6. 11. 13. Ioel. 2. Sophon. 2. Aggei. 2. Zachar. 2. &c.

<aside>Sacrifices Sacramentes tobe changed by Christ.</aside>

Sacrifices, Sacramentes, & other Rites the same as before. But more frequent Prophecies, that they should be changed into better, and perfecter by Christ. Prou. 9. Isai. 12. 52. 55. 61. In the meane time for more signification of the singular vertue of Christs Sacramentes, the effect of penitential workes is often recorded.

<aside>Fruit of pe-nance.</aside>

For example, wicked Achab by hairecloth, fasting, and other humiliation escaped part of his deserued punishment. 3. Reg. 21. Manasses recouered Gods fauoure, and his temporal kingdom. 2. Par. 33. Who yet was punished in his posteritie. 4. Reg. 23. And the Niniuites by such penance auoided destruction. Ione. 3. Yea nothing is more frequent in the Prophetes then preaching of penance. Isa. 1. 2. 3. 30. Iere. 3. 18. &c. and others, al ascribing the cause of plagues, and afflictions to the want of repentance. And false Prophetes condemned of errour and false doctrine, for promising the people peace, and securitie in their sinnes. Ierem. 14. Lamen. 2.

<aside>Abstinence.</aside>

Besides abstinence from diuers sortes of meates, counted vncleane (Isaie 66.) and ordinarie fastes, according to the law, other fastes were appointed sometimes, vpon occasions requiring, not only to subdue, and mortifie the flesh, but also to obtaine mercie at Gods handes in special distresses. 2. Par. 20. Ioel. 1. 2. Ione 3.

<aside>Fastes.</aside>

Elias fasting fourtie dayes, 3. Reg. 19. prefigured Christs fast. Which the Church imitateth in Lent of fourtie daies, according to humane habilitie, for the fastes of Christ, Elias, and Moyses were miraculous.

<aside>Lent.</aside>

<aside>Feastes.</aside>

To the Feastes instituted before, was added the Dedication of the Temple.
