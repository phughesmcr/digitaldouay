CHAP. XXVIII.

*Againe king Dauid calling al his states together, with commemoration of
Gods singular fauour in electing him, and Salomon, 8. exhorteth them al,
and namely his sonne to serue God sincerely: 10. and to build the temple,
describing in what forme to make it.*

<sup>1</sup> DAVID therfore called together al the princes of Israel,
the dukes of the tribes, and the heades of the compa-
nies, which ministred to the king: the tribunes also and the
centurions, and them that were chiefe ouer the substance
and possessions of the king, and his sonnes with the eunu-
ches, and the mightie, and al the most valiant in the host of
Ierusalem. <sup>2</sup> And when the king had risen vp, and stoode, he
sayd: Heare me my brethren, and my people: I meant to haue
built a house, wherein the Arke of our Lord might rest, and
the foote stoole of the feete of our God: and to build it I
prepared al thinges. <sup>3</sup> But God sayd to me: Thou shalt not
build a house to my name: because thou art a man of warre,
and hast shed bloud. <sup>4</sup> Howbeit our Lord the God of Israel
chose me of al the house of my father, to be king ouer Israel
for euer: for [^1] of Iuda he chose the princes: moreouer of the
house of Iuda, my fathers house: and of the sonnes of my fa-
ther, it pleased him to choose me king ouer al Israel. <sup>5</sup> Yea
and of my sonnes (for our Lord hath geuen me manie sonnes)
he hath chosen Salomon my sonne, to sitte in the throne of
the kingdome of our Lord ouer Israel, <sup>6</sup> and he sayd to me:
Salomon thy sonne shal build my house, and my courtes: for
him haue I chosen to me for a sonne, and I wil be to him for a
father. <sup>7</sup> And I wil confirme his kingdome for euer, if he
shal perseuer to doe my preceptes, and my iudgementes,

[^1]: So Iacob prophecied, that the royal scepter should come to the tribe of Iuda, and therein remaine til Christ. Gen. 49.
