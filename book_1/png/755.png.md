went vpon the altar, which he had built in Bethel, the fif- [^1]

CHAP. XII.

*A prophet sent from Iuda to Bethel foretelleth the birth of Iosias, and destru-
ction of Ieroboams altar, 4. whose hand being suddenly withered, 6. is re-
stored by the prophets prayer. 11. The same prophet is deceiued by an other
prophet, and slaine by a lion. 33. Hieroboam proceedeth in impietie.*

<sup>1</sup> AND behold a man of God came out of Iuda, in the word
of our Lord into Bethel, Ieroboam standing vpon
the altar, and censing. <sup>2</sup> And he cried out against the altar
in the word of our Lord, and sayd: Altar, altar, thus saith our
Lord: Behold a child shal be borne to the house of Dauid,
named Iosias, and he shal immolate vpon thee priestes of the
excelses, which now doe burne frankencense on thee, and
he shal burne mens bones vpon thee. <sup>3</sup> And he gaue a signe
in that day, saying: This shal be the signe, that our Lord hath
spoken: Behold the altar shal be clouen, and the ashes shal
be powred out in it. <sup>4</sup> And when the king had heard the
word of the man of God, which he cried out against the altar
in Bethel, he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying:
Take him. And his hand withered, which he stretched forth
agaynst him: neither was he able to draw it backe vnto him.
<sup>5</sup> The altar also was clouen, and the ashes were powred out
of the altar, according to the signe which the man of God
had told before in the word of our Lord. <sup>6</sup> And the king said
to the man of God: Beseech the face of our Lord thy God,
and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me. And the
man of God besought the face of our Lord, and the kinges
hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.
<sup>7</sup> And the king spake to the man of God: Come home
with me, that thou mayst dyne, and I wil geue thee giftes.
<sup>8</sup> And the man of God answered the king: If thou woul-
dest geue me the halfe part of thy house, I wil not come
with thee, nor eate bread, nor drinke water in this place:
<sup>9</sup> for so was it enioyned in the word of our Lord c≈çmanding:
Thou shalt not eate bread nor drinke water, nor returne by
the way that thou camest. <sup>10</sup> He departed therfore by an other
way, and returned not by the way, that he came into Bethel.
