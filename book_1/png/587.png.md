grace of the father of the house fauorable towardes me. To
whom she answered: Goe my daughter. <sup>3</sup> She went therfore
and gathered the eares of corne after the backes of the reapers. And it chanced that the owner of the same field was
Booz, who was of the kinred of Elimelech. <sup>4</sup> And behold,
he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: Our
Lord be with you. Who answered him: Our Lord blesse thee.
<sup>5</sup> And Booz said to the yongman, that was ouerseer of the
reapers: Whose maide is this? <sup>6</sup> To whom he answered:
This is that Moabite, which came with Noemi, from the
countrie of Moab, <sup>7</sup> and she desired that she might gather
the eares of corne that remayne, folowing the steppes of the
reapers: and from morning vntil now she stayeth in the field,
and not so much as for a very moment hath she returned
home. <sup>8</sup> And Booz said to Ruth: Heare me daughter, goe not
into an other field to gather, neither depart thou from this
place: but ioyne thy selfe to my maides, <sup>9</sup> and where they
haue reaped, folow. For I haue commanded my seruantes,
that no man molest thee: but if thou shalt thirst also, goe
to the sardels, and drinke the waters, wherof the seruantes
also doe drinke. <sup>10</sup> who falling on her face and adoring vpon
the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that
I should find grace before thine eies, and that thou wouldest vouchsafe to know me a strange woman? <sup>11</sup> To whom he
answered: Al thinges haue beene told me, which thou hast
done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband:
and that thou hast leift thy parentes, and the land wherein
thou wast borne, and art come to a people, which before
thou knewest not. <sup>12</sup> Our Lord render vnto thee for thy
worke, and God grant thou mayest receiue a ful reward of
our Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, & vnder
whose winges thou art fled. <sup>13</sup> Who said: I haue found grace
in thine eies my lord, which hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the hart of thy handmaide, which am not like to one
of thy maides. <sup>14</sup> And Booz said to her: When the houre shal
come to eate, come hither, and eate bread, and dippe thy
morsel in the vinagre. She therfore sate at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to her selfe polent, and did eate and was
filled, and tooke the leauinges. <sup>15</sup> And from thence she arose,
to gleane the eares of corne after her maner. And Booz commanded his seruantes, saying: Yea and if she wil reape with
you,
