<sup>1</sup>Who maketh a man to that is an hypocrite reigne for the sinnes of the people.

<sup>2</sup>Therfore because I haue spoken to God, thee also I wil not prohibite. <sup>3</sup>If I haue erred, teach thou me: if I haue spoken iniquitie, I wil adde no more. <sup>4</sup>Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou beganst to speake, and not I: but if thou know anie better thing, speake. <sup>5</sup>Let men of vnderstanding speake to me, and let a wiseman heare me. <sup>6</sup>But Iob hath spoken folishly, and his wordes sound not discipline. <sup>7</sup>O my father, let Iob be proued euen to the end: cease not from the man of iniquitie. <sup>8</sup>Who addeth blasphemie vpon his sinnes, let him be restrayned in the meane time among vs: and then let him prouoke God to iudgement with his speeches.

CHAP. XXXV.

*Eliu pretending that iob had sayde God to be vniust, sheweth that mans pietie nor impietie neither profiteth nor disprofiteth God: 13 and that he iudgeth al thinges rightly.*

THERFORE Eliu againe spake these wordes: <sup>1</sup>Doth thy cogitation seme iust to thee, that thou saydst: I am iuster then God? <sup>2</sup>For thou saydst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what wil it profite thee if I sinne? <sup>3</sup>Therfore wil I answer to thy wordes, & to thy frendes with thee. <sup>4</sup>Looke vp to heauen and see, and behold the skie, that it is higher then thou. <sup>5</sup>If thou sinne, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thine iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou doe against him? <sup>6</sup>Moreouer if thou doe iustly, what shalt thou geue him, or what shal he receiue of thy hand? <sup>7</sup>Man that is like to thee, thy impietie shal hurt: and thy iustice shal helpe the sonne of man. <sup>8</sup>Because of the multitude of calumniatours they shal cry: and shal waile for the force of the arme of tyrants. <sup>9</sup>And he hath not sayd: Where is God, that made me, that hath geuen songs in the night? <sup>10</sup>Who teacheth vs aboue the beastes of the earth, and instructeth vs aboue the foules of the ayre. <sup>11</sup>There shal they crie, and he wil not heare, because of the pride of the euil. <sup>12</sup>God therfore wil not heare without cause, and the Omnipotent wil behold the causes of euerie one. <sup>13</sup>Yea when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be iudged before him, & expect him. <sup>14</sup>For he doth not now inferre his furie, neither doth he reuenge wickednesse ex-

[^1]: Eliu applieth both vpon nations, and vpon al men

[^2]: Eliu applieth this to Iob, as though he had made false shew of vertue which he had not, and that God had suffe- red him hi- therto to reigne, or ra- ther to tyran- nize for iust punishment of his peoples sin- nes. But God at last declared that Iob was not such a one. ch. 42. v. 7.

[^3]: Eliu insisteth much in this calumniation, for Iob neuer said, that he was iust compa- red with God, but that his affliction was greater then his sinne. ch. 6. v. 3. c. 3. v. 7. c. 6.

[^4]: These are strong senten- ces (saith S. Gregorie) but they agree not (or be not ap- plied) to the blessed person of Iob. li. 26. c. 7.
