<sup>29</sup> Doth the hawke waxe fethered by thy wisedome, spreding her winges to the South? <sup>30</sup> Shal the eagle mount at thy commandment, and put her nest in high places? <sup>31</sup> She abideth in rockes, and tarieth among cragged flintes, and stonie hilles where is no accesse. <sup>32</sup> Thence she beholdeth the praye, and her eies see a far of. <sup>33</sup> Her yong ones shal licke bloud: & wher-soeuer the carcasse shal be, she is present by and by. <sup>34</sup> And our Lord added, and spake to Iob: <sup>35</sup> He that contendeth with God is he quieted so easily? Verely he that reproueth God, ought to answer him. <sup>36</sup> But Iob answering our Lord, sayd: <sup>37</sup> I that haue spoken lightly what can I answer? I wil put my hand vpon my mouth. <sup>38</sup> One thing I haue spoken, which I would I had not sayd: and an other, to the which thinges I wil adde no more.

CHAP. XL.

*Our Lord further sheweth his manie powre, nor iustice, is not comparable to Gods, 10. as appeareth in ouercoming Behemoth, 20. and Leuiathan.*

<sup>1</sup> AND our Lord answering Iob out of the whirlewinde, sayd: <sup>2</sup> Gird thy loynes as a man: I wil aske thee, and doe thou tel me. <sup>3</sup> Shalt thou make my iudgement of none effect: and condemne me, that thou mayst be iustified? <sup>4</sup> And hast thou an arme as God, and dost thou thunder with like voice. <sup>5</sup> Put beautie about thee, and set vp thy selfe aloft, and be glorious, and put on goodlie garmentes. <sup>6</sup> Disperse the prowde in thy furie, and beholding euerie arrogant man, hum-ble him. <sup>7</sup> Behold al the prowde, and confound them, and destroy the impious in their place. <sup>8</sup> Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces in the pit. <sup>9</sup> And I wil con-fesse, that thy right hand is able to saue thee. <sup>10</sup> Behold, Be-hemoth whom I made with thee, shal eate hay as it were an oxe. <sup>11</sup> His strength is in his loynes, and his powre in the nauil of his bellie. <sup>12</sup> He gathereth together his taile as the ceder tree, the sinewes of his stones are perplexe. <sup>13</sup> His bones are as pipes of brasse, his gristle as it were plates of iron. <sup>14</sup> He is the beginning of the wayes of God, which made him, he shal applie his sword. <sup>15</sup> To him the mountaines beare grasse: al the beastes of the field shal play there. <sup>16</sup> He sleepeth vnder the shadow, in the secrete of the reede, and in moyst places.

<aside>These difficultes of Iobs wordes (seub s. Greg. nu.) we shal find nothing wickedly spo-ken, but only smale peeces of pride in spe-aking too much of his owne afflicti√µ and too litle of Gods good-nes towards him li. 31. c. 1.</aside>

<aside>Though Iob had truly a-uouched that his sinnes de-serued not so great afflicti-ons, yet he ought to haue ac-knowledged that God affli-cted him iust-ly, for some other cause knowne to God, but vn-knowne to him, which he not confessing seemed to make Gods iudge-ment vniust: or, of none effect. s. Greg. li. 32. c. 1. an Elephant the greatest</aside>
