Salomon: moreouer Roboam was rude, and of a fearful hart, and could not resist them. <sup>8</sup>Now therfore you say that you are able to resist the kingdom of our Lord, which he possesseth by the children of Dauid, and you haue a great multitude of people, and golden calues, which Ieroboam hath made you for goddes. <sup>9</sup>And you haue cast out the Priestes of our Lord, the children of Aaron, and the Leuites: and you haue made you priestes, as al the peoples of the earth: who soeuer shal come & consecrate his hand in a bullock of oxen, and in seuen rammes, is made the priest of them that are not goddes. <sup>10</sup>But our Lord is God, whom we forsake not, and the Priestes do minister to our Lord of the children of Aaron, and the Leuites are in their order. <sup>11</sup>Holocaustes also they do offer to our Lord, euerie day morning and euening, and incense made according to the preceptes of the law, and the loaues are set forth on a most cleane table, and there is with vs the golden condlesticke, and the lampes therof, that they may be lighted alwaies at euening: for we keepe the preceptes of the Lord our God, whom you haue forsaken. <sup>12</sup>Therfore in our host God is the prince, and his Priestes, which sound with trumpettes, and resound agaynst you: children of Israel fight not agaynst our Lord the God of your fathers, because it is not expedient for you. <sup>13</sup>He speaking these thinges, Ieroboam endeuoured to entrappe him behind. And when he stood ouer agaynst the enemies, he compassed Iuda vnwitting with his armie. <sup>14</sup>And Iudas looking backe, saw the battel at hand before and behind, and cryed to our Lord: and the Priestes begane to sound with trumpettes. <sup>15</sup>And al the men of Iuda made a shoute: and behold they crying, God terrified Ieroboam, and al Israel that stood agaynst Abias and Iuda. <sup>16</sup>And the children of Israel fled from Iuda, and our Lord deliuered them into their hand. <sup>17</sup>Abias therfore and his people stroke them with a great slaughter, and there fel wounded of Israel fiue hundreth thousand valiant men. <sup>18</sup>And the children of Israel were humbled, at that time, and the children of Iuda exceedingly encouraged because they had trusted in our Lord the God of their fathers. <sup>19</sup>And Abias pursewed Ieroboam fleing, and he tooke his cities, Bethel and her daughters, and Iesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters. <sup>20</sup>Neither was Ieroboam able to resist anie more, in the daies of Abias: whom our Lord stroke, and he died.
