# The booke

<sup>5</sup>Since man was placed vpon the earth, † That the praise of the impious is short, and the ioy of the hypocrite as it were for a moment: † <sup>6</sup>If his pride rise vp euen to the heauen, and his head touch the cloudes: † <sup>7</sup>As a dunghill in the end he shal be destroyed, and they that had sene him, shal say: Where is he? † <sup>8</sup>As a dreame that fleeth away he shal not be found, he shal passe as a vision by night: † <sup>9</sup>The eie that had sene him, shal not see him, neither shal his place behold him anie more. † <sup>10</sup>His children shal come to naught with pouertie, and his handes shal render him his sorow. † <sup>11</sup>His bones shal be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shal sleepe with him in the dust. † <sup>12</sup>For when euil shal be sweete in his mouth, he wil hide it vnder his tongue. † <sup>13</sup>He wil spare it, and not leaue it, and wil hide it in his throte. † <sup>14</sup>His bread in his belly shal be turned into the galle of aspes within him. † <sup>15</sup>The riches which he hath deuoured, he shal vomite out, and God shal draw them forth out of his belly. † <sup>16</sup>He shal sucke the head of aspes, and the vipers tongue shal kil him. († Let him not see the streames of the riuer, the torrentes of honie, & of butter.) † <sup>18</sup>He shal be punished for al thinges that he did, & yet not be consumed: according to the multitude of his inuentions so also shal he suffer. † <sup>19</sup>Because breaking in he hath made the poore naked: he hath violently taken house, & built it not. † <sup>20</sup>Neither is his bellie filled: and when he shal haue the thinges he coueted, he can not possesse them. † <sup>21</sup>There remayned not of his meate, & therfore nothing shal continue of his goodes: † <sup>22</sup>When he shal be filled, he shal be straytened, he shal burne, and al sorow shal fal vpon him. † <sup>23</sup>Would God his belly were filled, that he may send forth the wrath of his furie vpon him, and rayne his battel vpon him. † <sup>24</sup>He shal flee weapons of yron, and shal fal vpon a bowe of brasse. † <sup>25</sup>The sword plucked out, and coming forth of his scabbard, and glistering in his bitterness: the horrible shal goe and come vpon him. † <sup>26</sup>Al darkenesse is hid in his secretes: fyre that is not kindled shal deuoure him, he shal be afflicted leaft in his tabernacle. † <sup>27</sup>The heauens shal reuele his iniquitie, and the earth shal rise against him. † <sup>28</sup>The blossome of his house shal be opened, he shal be plucked downe in the day of Gods furie. † <sup>29</sup>This the portion of an impious man from God, & the inheritance of his wordes from our Lord.

<aside>A mans life is short and as a moment in comparison of eternitie; but it is not alwayes true that the wicked are shortly punished in respect of this life, as this disputer supplieth it to proue Iob to impious. Therefore Iob answereth in the next chapter.</aside>

[^1]: 2-13. That ordinarily the wicked, lead their whole life (to wit their dayes) in wealth and (then) in a moment goe downe to hel. So the rest of these mens assertions are for most part true in some sense but il applied.
