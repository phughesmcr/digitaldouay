of men? why hast thou sette me contrarie to thee, and I am become burdenous to my self? â€  why doest thou not take away my sinne, and why doest thou not take away mine iniquitie? Behold now I shal sleepe in the dust: and if thou seeke me in the morning, I shal not be.

CHAP. VIII.

*Baldad chargeth Iob to haue spoken iniustly exhorting him to turne to God, and so be shal prosper better then heretofore .13. shewing that hypocrites shal not prosper. 20. inferreth (falsly) that God afflicteth not the sincere, nor helpeth the malignant.*

<sup>1</sup>But Baldad the Suhite answering, sayd: <sup>2</sup>How long wilt thou speake such thinges, and shal the spirit of the wordes of thy mouth be multiplied? <sup>3</sup>Why doth God supplant iugement? or doth the Omnipotent subuert that which is iust? <sup>4</sup>Although thy children haue sinned to him, and he hath least them in the hand of their iniquitie: <sup>5</sup>Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Omnipotent: <sup>6</sup>If thou wilt walke cleane & vpright, he wil forthwith awake vnto thee, and wil make the habitation of thy iustice peaceable: <sup>7</sup>In so much, that if thy former thinges haue bene litle, thy later thinges may be multiplied exceedingly. <sup>8</sup>For aske the old generation, and search diligently the memorie of the fathers. <sup>9</sup>(For we are but as yesterday, and are ignorant: that our daies vpon the earth are as a shadow.) <sup>10</sup>And they shal teach thee: they shal speake to thee, and from their hart shal vtter wordes. <sup>11</sup>Can the rush be greene without moysture? or a seggie place grow without water? <sup>12</sup>When it is yet in his flowre, and is not plucked with the hand, it witereth before al hearbes: <sup>13</sup>Euen so the waies of al, that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shal perish: <sup>14</sup>His folie shal not please him, and his confidence as the spiders webbe. <sup>15</sup>He shal leane vpon his house, and it shal not stand: he shal stay it vp, and it shal not rise: <sup>16</sup>He semeth moystened before the sunne come, and in his rising his blossome shal goe forth. <sup>17</sup>Vpon a heape of rockes his rootes shal be thicke, and among stones he shal abide. <sup>18</sup>If he swallow him vp out of his place, he wil denie him, & wil say: I know thee not. <sup>19</sup>For this is the ioy of his way, that others may spring againe of the earth. <sup>20</sup>God wil not reiect the simple, nor reach his hand to the malignant. <sup>21</sup>Vntil thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lippes

<aside>The second conflict.</aside>

<aside>This second disputer charged Iob to be obstinate who in dede was constant in a true setled iudgement.</aside>
