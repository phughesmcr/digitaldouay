<sup>3</sup> to me: For the care proneth wordes, and the threat discerneth meates by the tast. <sup>4</sup> Let vs choose vs iudgement, and among vs let vs see what is the better. <sup>5</sup> Because Iob sayd: I am iust, and God hath subuerted my iudgement. <sup>6</sup> For in iudging me there is a lie: mine arrow is violent without anie sinne. <sup>7</sup> What man is there as is Iob, that drinketh skorning as it were water? <sup>8</sup> That goeth with them that worke iniquitie, and walketh with impious men? <sup>9</sup> For he hath sayd: Man shal not please God although he runne with him <sup>10</sup> Therfore ye discrete men heare me, far from God be impietie, and iniquitie from the Omnipotent. <sup>11</sup> For he wil render a man his worke, and according to the waies of euerie one he wil recompence them. <sup>12</sup> For in verie deed God wil not condemne without cause, neither wil the Omnipotent subuert iudgement. <sup>13</sup> What other hath he appointed ouer the earth? or whom hath he sette ouer the world, which he made? <sup>14</sup> If he direct his hart to him, he shal drawe his spirit and breath vnto him. <sup>15</sup> Al flesh shal faile together, and man shal returne into ashes. <sup>16</sup> If then thou haue vnderstanding, heare that is sayd, and harken to the voice of my speach. <sup>17</sup> Can he that loueth not iudgement, be healed? and how doest thou so far condemne him, that is iust? <sup>18</sup> That sayth to the king, Apostata: that calleth dukes impious: <sup>19</sup> Who accepteth not the persones of princes: nor hath knowen the tyrant, when he contended against the poore man: for al are the worke of his handes. <sup>20</sup> They shal sodenly die, and at midnight peoples shal be trubled, and shal passe, and take away the violent without hand. <sup>21</sup> For his eies are vpon the waies of men, and he considereth al their steppes. <sup>22</sup> There is not darkenesse, and there is not shadow of death, that they may be hid there which worke iniquitie. <sup>23</sup> For it is no more in mans powre, to come to God into iudgement. <sup>24</sup> He shal destroy manie, & innumerable, & shal make other to stand for them <sup>25</sup> For he knoweth their workes: and therfore he shal bring night, and they shal be destroyed <sup>26</sup> As impious men he hath stroken them in the place of them that see. <sup>27</sup> Who as it were of purpose haue reuolted from him, and would not vnderstand al his waies: <sup>28</sup> That th y caused the crie of the needie man to come to him and he heard the voice of the poore. <sup>29</sup> For he granting peace, who is there that can condemne? After he shal hide his countenance, who is there that may behold him,

[^1]: Iob said not that God subuerted his iudgement for wrongfully iudgeing, but God hath so afflicted him, that he might seeme to haue done it.

<aside>2. Neither did Iob by this (v. 11.) but Eliu wrested his meaning that he might haue something to reprehend & correct.</aside>
