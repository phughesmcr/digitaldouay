Continuance of the Church and Religion.

Temple, 3. Reg. 7. 2, Par. 3, Which was built in Mount Moria, 2. Par. 3. the special place designed long before for this purpose, when Abraham was directed thither by God, & was there readie to sacrifice his sonne Isaac. Gen. 22. where David also offered sacrifice. 2. Reg. 24. 1. Par. 21.

This being the onlie ordinarie place for Sacrifice, there were for other uses of daylie prayer reading, preaching, and hearing the word of God other Synagogues built (as it were Parish churches) in great number: in Ierusalem it self foure hundred and some score, and manie more in the whole kingdom, as the Hebrew Traditions testifie. Of al which places, especially of the Temple, there was venerable respect had. For which cause when Ioiada the High Priest gave order to kil Athalia, he suffered it not to be donne in the Temple, but commanded first to draw her forth. 4. Reg. 11. 2. Par. 23. And as peculiar places, so special Psalmes, and Hymnes were appointed for divers purposes and occasions. 2. Par. 20.

The ministerie of Angeles was very usual in this time. One was sent to comforte and direct Elias the prophet in his afflictions: 3. Reg. 19. 4. Reg. 1. An Angel stroke the Assyrians whole campe, 4. Reg. 19. 2. Par. 32. Also the Intercession of Angels is so evident, Tobie 12. Raphael offering Tobias prayer to God, that Protestants have no other refuge to avoide this point of faith, but by denying the Booke to be Canonical Scripture.

Honour of other Sainctes, and their Intercession is proved a Maiori. For so much as honour was religiously exhibited to spiritual power and excellencie, in men yet living in this world. So a Noble man adored Elias the Prophet, being farre greater then he in civil, and worldlie respectes. 3. Reg. 18. Eliseus also was adored by his disciples, not for anie worldlie authoritie or eminence, but for his spiritual power and superioritie amongst them. 4. Reg. 2. Likewise al Prophetes, and Priestes were religiously honoured for their holie and spiritual functions. 3. Reg. 13. Much more Sainctes are rightly honored being immortal, and in eternal glorie. It appeareth also that Elias, seuen yeares after that he was translated from humane conversation (when Eliseus was chiefe Prophet. 4. Reg. 3. which was in or before the eighteenth yeare of Iosaphat, who reigned five and twentie. 3. Reg. 22.) had care of Ioram, and his kingdom, admonishing him by letters of Gods wrath against him and his people for their sinnes. 2. Par. 21. And the Scripture saith often, that God spared and protected Ierusalem, and the kingdom of Iuda for Davids sake. 3. Reg. 11. 15. 4. Reg. 8. 19. 20. 2. Par. 6. 21. Isa. 37. We have also example of Sainctes Reliques in the cloke of Elias. 4. Reg. 2. in Eliseus bones, 4. Reg. 13. and in an other Prophetes bodie buried in Bethel, which Iosias would not suffer to be touched. 4. Reg. 23. Images were conserved in the Temple, 3. Reg. 7. as before in the Tabernacle: when idolatrie was most destroyed. 3. Reg.
