<sup>7</sup> A man said to his sonne in law: I beseech thee that thou tarie here to day, and let vs make merie together. But he ry-sing vp, beganne as if he would depart. And neuertheles with much adoe his father in law stayed him, and made him to <sup>8</sup> tarie with him. But when morning was come, the Leuite prepared to goe his iourney. To whom his father in law againe: I beseech thee, quoth he, that thou take a litle meate, and making thy self strong, til the day be farder spent, after-ward thou mayest depart. They did eate therfore together. <sup>9</sup> And the yong man arose, that he might sette forward with his wife and his seruant. To whom his father in law spake againe: Consider that the day is more declining to the west, and draweth nigh to euening: tarie with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and to morrow thou shalt depart that <sup>10</sup> thou mayst goe into thy house. His sonne in law would not condescend to his wordes: but forthwith went forward, and came ouer against Iebus, which by an other name is cal-led Ierusalem, leading with him two asses loden, and his <sup>11</sup> concubine.

And behold there ap-peared an old man, returning out of the field and from his worke in the euening, who him self also was of mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa; but the men of <sup>17</sup> that countrie were the children of Iemini. And lifting vp his eies, the old man saw the man sitting with his fardels in the streate of the citie, and said to him: Whence comest thou? <sup>18</sup> and whither goest thou?
