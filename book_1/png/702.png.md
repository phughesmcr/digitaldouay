<sup>48</sup> God which geuest me reuenges, and throwest downe peoples vnder me.

<sup>49</sup> Which bringest me out from myne enemies, and from them that resist me dost lift me vp: from the wicked man thou shalt deliuer me.

<sup>50</sup> Therefore wil I confesse vnto thee o Lord among the Gentiles, and wil sing to thy name.

CHAP. XXIII.

The last wordes of Dauid concerning reward of the good, 6. and punishment of the bad. 8. A Catalogue of Dauids valiant men.

<sup>1</sup> AND these are Dauides last wordes. Dauid the sonne of Isai sayd: The man sayd, to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Iacob, the excellent Psalmist of Israel: <sup>2</sup> The Spirit of our Lord hath spoken by me, and his wordes by my tongue. <sup>3</sup> The God of Israel sayd to me, the Strong one of Israel hath spoken, the Dominatour of men, the iust ruler in the feare of God. <sup>4</sup> As the light of the morning when the sunne ryseth, early without cloudes, glistreth, and as by rayne grasse springeth out of the earth.

For al my saluation, and al my wil: neither is there ought therof that springeth not. <sup>6</sup> And transgressors shal be plucked vp as thornes euery one: which are not taken with handes. <sup>7</sup> And if a man wil touch them, he shal be armed with yron and a lance staffe, and kindled with fyre they shal be burnt vnto nothing. <sup>8</sup> These be the names of the valiances of Dauid. Sitting in his chaire the wisest prince amongst three, he is as it were the most tender litle worme of the wood, which killed eight hundred at one brunt. <sup>9</sup> After him, Eleazar the sonne of his vncle the Ahohite among the three valiantes, that were with Dauid when they defyed the Philisthijms, and were gathered thither into battel. <sup>10</sup> And when the men of Israel were gone vp, he stood and stroke the Philistims til his hand faynted, and waxed stiffe with the sword: and our Lord made a great victorie that day: and the people, that was fled, returned to take away of the spoyles of them that were slayne. <sup>11</sup> And after him Semma the sonne of Age

[^1]: Gentiles pertaining to the Church of Christ, which is here foreshewed and described to haue perpetual seede for euer.

[^2]: King Dauid in this last prophecie plainly distinguisheth between the couenant & promise made to him touching his earthlie kingdom and the kingdom of Christ, who should be borne of his seede.
