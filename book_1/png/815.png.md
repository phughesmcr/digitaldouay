also victimes, and burnt incense in the excelses, and on the
hilles, and vnder euery tree full of greene leaues. <sup>5</sup> Then
went vp Rasin the king of Syria, and Phacee the sonne of
Romelia the king of Israel into Ierusalem to fight: & when
they besieged Achaz, they were not able to ouercome him.
<sup>6</sup> At that time Rasin the king of Syria restored Aila to Syria,
and threw out the Iewes out of Aila: and the Idumeians came
into Aila, and dwelt there vnto this day. <sup>7</sup> And Achaz sent
messengers to Theglathphalasar the king of the Assyrians,
saying: I am thy seruant, and thy sonne: come vp, and saue
me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and from the hand
of the king of Israel, which are risen together against me.
<sup>8</sup> And when he had gathered together the siluer and gold,
that could be founde in the house of our Lord, and in the
kings treasures, he sent giftes to the king of the Assyrians.
<sup>9</sup> Who also agreed to his wil: for the king of the Assyrians
went vp into Damascus, and wasted it: and he transferred
the inhabitants thereof to Cyrene, but Rasin he slew. <sup>10</sup> And
king Achaz went forth to meete Theglathphalasar the king
of the Assyrians into Damascus, and when he had seene the
altar of Damascus, king Achaz sent to Vrias the priest a pa-
terne of it, and a similitude according to al the worke therof.
<sup>11</sup> And Vrias the priest built an altar, according to al things,
which king Achaz had commanded, from Damascus, so did
the priest Vrias, whilest king Achaz came from Damascus.
<sup>12</sup> And when the king was come from Damascus, he saw the
altar and worshipped it: and went vp and immolated holo-
caustes, and his sacrifice, <sup>13</sup> and offered libamentes, and
powred the bloud of the pacifiques, which he had offered
vpon the altar. <sup>14</sup> Moreouer the altar of brasse that was be-
fore our lord, he remoued from the face of the temple, and
from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple
of our Lord: and he sett it at the side of the altar toward the
North. <sup>15</sup> King Achaz also comanded Vrias the priest, saying:
Vpon the greater altar offer the morning holocaust, and the
euening sacrifice, and the kings holocaust, and his sacrifice,
and the holocaust of the whole people of the land, and their
sacrifices, and their libamentes: and al the bloud of the
holocaust, and al the bloud of the victime thou shalt powre
out vpon it: but the altar of brasse shalbe prepared readie at
my pleasure <sup>16</sup> Vrias therfore the priest did according to al
things,
