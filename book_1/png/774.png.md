# Third booke Achab. Naboth. Iezabel.

whiles I being trubled turned hither and thither, sodenly he appeared not. And the king of Israel sayd to him: This is thy iudgement, which thy self hast decreed. <sup>41</sup> But he forthwith wyped of the dust from his face, and the king of Israel knew him, that he was of the prophetes. <sup>42</sup> Who sayd to him: Thus sayth our Lord: Because thou hast let goe out of thy hand a man worthie to die, thy life shal be for his life, and thy people for his people. <sup>43</sup> The king of Israel therfore returned into his house, contemning to heare, & raging came into Samaria.

## Chap. XXI.

*Naboth for denying his vineyard to King Achab, is by quene Iezabels commandment, falsly accused, and stoned to death. 10. Achab hastening to possesse the vineyard, Elias the prophet threatneth him manie euiles. 25. And no lesse to Iezabel: both being obstinate in sinne. 27. Yet Achab for feare of punishment, doth external workes of penance, and therby escapeth part of the temporal plagues.*

Neither was it a value scruple in Naboth, to conserue his ancesters inhe- ritance. For
