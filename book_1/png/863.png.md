therefore assembled al Israel from Sihor of Egypt, til thou enter
into Emath, to bring the Arke of God from Caria Thiarim.
<sup>6</sup> And Dauid went vp, and euerie man of Israel to the hil of
Caria Thiarim which is in Iuda, to fetch thence the Arke
of our Lord God sitting vpon the Cherubim, where his name
<sup>7</sup> is inuocated. And they layd the Arke of God vpon a new
wayne, out of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his bre-
<sup>8</sup> ther did driue the wayne. Moreouer Dauid, and al Israel
playd before our Lord with al their might in songes, and on
harpes, and psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trum-
<sup>9</sup> pettes. And when they were come to the Floore of Chidon,
Oza stretched forth his hand, to hold vp the Arke: for the oxe
<sup>10</sup> being wantone had made it leane a litle a side. Our Lord
therfore was angrie agaynst Oza, and stroke him, for that he
had touched the Arke: and he died there before our Lord.
<sup>11</sup> And Dauid was strooken sad, because our Lord had diuided
Oza: and he called that place, the Diuision of Oza vntil this
<sup>12</sup> present day. And he feared God at that time, saying: How
<sup>13</sup> may I bring in the Arke of God vnto me? And for this
cause he brought it not vnto himselfe, that is, into the citie
of Dauid, but turned it away into the house of Obededom
<sup>14</sup> the Getheite. Therfore the Arke of God remayned in
the house of Obededom three monethes: & our Lord blessed
his house, and al thinges that he had.

<sup>1</sup> HIRAM also the king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid,
and cedar trees, and artificers for walles, and timber:

established him to be king ouer Israel, and that his kingdom
<sup>3</sup> was exalted ouer his people Israel. Dauid also tooke other
<sup>4</sup> wiues in Ierusalem: and he begat sonnes, and daughters. And

<sup>8</sup> hearing that Dauid was annoynted for king ouer al Israel,
