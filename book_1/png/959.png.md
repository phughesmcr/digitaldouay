Continuance in the kingdome of Iuda standing after the separation of tenne tribes about foure hundred yeares, though some kinges were wicked, yet some were good; and in them al God preserued Dauids seede, by the line of Salomon, in this direct succession: Roboam, Abias, Asa, Iosaphat, Ioram, Ochozias, Ioas (in whose infancie, his grandmother Athalia vsurped the kingdome six yeares) Amasias, Ozias, Ioathan, Achaz, Ezechias, Manasses, Amon, Iosias, Ioachaz (his three sonne euer succeeding his father) then Ioakim (brother of Ioachaz) Ioachin otherwise called Iechonias, sonne of Ioachin. And finallie his Vncle Sedecias; who was caried captiue into babilon. But Iechonias by Gods special prouidence, was fauored and exalted by a new king of Babilon. Whither he was led captiue before. In whose line Dauids offspring continued though not with title of kinges, yet in eminent state, and estimation. As resteth to be noted in the sixt age of the world.

The progenie also of Aaron continued in their office and function of Priesthood, with succession of High Priestes; as before from Aaron to Sadoc, partly in the line of Eleazar, partlie of Ithamar, both Aarons sonnes; so from Sadoc, by the like succession of both families. For of Eleazar is recorded this Genealogie 1. Paral. 6. Sadoc, Achimaas, Azarias, Iohanan, Azarias, Amarias, Achitob, Sadoc, Sellum, Helcias, Azarias, Zaraias, and Iosedech. Who was High Priest in the captiuitie. (v. 15.) being caried into Babilon in the first transmigration with king Iechonias, before the general captiuitie of al, as it seemeth 4. Reg. 24. his father Zaraias yet liuing, who was slaine nine yeares after by Nabuchodonosor, 4. Reg. 25. And amongst these there were some High Priestes of Ithamars line. Towitte, Ioram, Ioiada (4. Reg. 11. 2. Par. 23.) Ioathan, Vrias, (4. Reg. 16) and some others; or els some of the abouementioned, had other names. recited by Iosephus. lib. 10. cap. 11. Antiq. and Nicephorus lib. 2. cap. 4. Hist. Eccles.

Moreouer besides this ordinarie succession of Priestes, there was an extraordinarie mission of Prophetes: to supply more fullie the office of preaching the truth, and admonishing offenders. And those God inspired and sent, most especiallie when and where errors sprong, and sinnes most abounded: geuing them extraordinarie grace and most excellent vertues, to counterpose the enormities of wicked men. Such were in the times of Achab and Iezabel, in the kingdome of Israel, besides manie others, the two famous great Prophets Elias, & Eliseus. Whose admirable liues and holie conuersation were a mirrour to the world, and great terrour to the wicked, whose workes and miracles meruelouslie confirmed the wel disposed, encouraged the weake, conuerted manie transgressors, confounded false Prophets, iustified their owne preaching, and much glorified God.
