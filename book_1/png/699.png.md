CHAP. XXII.

*King Davids Canticle of thankesgeuing, for his deliverie from al enemies: 44. With a prophecie of the reiection of the Iewes, and vocation of the Gentiles.*

<sup>1</sup> AND David spake to our Lord the wordes of this song, in :: the day that our Lord delivered him out of the hand of al his enemies, and out of the hand of :: Saul. <sup>2</sup> And he sayd:

Our Lord is my rocke, and my strength, and my saviour.

<sup>3</sup> God is my strong one, I wil hope in him: my shield, and the horne of my salvation: my lifter vp, and my refuge: my saviour, from iniquitie thou wilt deliver me.

<sup>4</sup> Our Lord prayse worthie wil I invocate: and from mine enemies I shal be saved.

<sup>5</sup> Because the pangues of death have compassed me: the streames of Belial have terrified me.

<sup>6</sup> The ropes of hel have compassed me: the snares of death have prevented me.

<sup>7</sup> In my tribulation I wil invocate our Lord, and I wil crie to my God: and he wil heare my voice out of his holie temple, and my crie shal come to his eares.

<sup>8</sup> The earth quaked and trembled, the fundations of the mountaynes

<aside>:: After that David was delivered from the handes of Saul (who first and longest & most dangerously of al men persecuted him, and therfore is here specially named) and from al his enemies, corporal & spiritual, when he had good repose of mind, his visible enemies being subverted.</aside>
