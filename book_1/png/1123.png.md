of Ion. 1105

<sup>16</sup> Knowest thou the great pathes of the clowdes, and the perfect knowledges? <sup>17</sup> Are not thy garments hote, when the earth shal <sup>18</sup> be blowen with the South winde? <sup>19</sup> Thou perhaps madst the heauens with him, which are most sound, cast as it were of brasse. Shew vs what we may say to him: for we are wrapped <sup>20</sup> in darkenes. <sup>21</sup> Who shal tel him the things that I speake? yea if man shal speake, he shal be deuoured. <sup>22</sup> But now they see not the light: sodenly the ayre shal be thickned into clowdes, and the wind passing by shal driue them away. <sup>23</sup> From the North gold cometh, & toward God: fearful praysing. <sup>24</sup> We can not find him worthely: great of strength, and iudgement, and iustice, and he can not be vttered. Therefore shal men feare him, and al that seme to themselues to be wise, shal not dare to behold him.

<aside>Man not able to praise God sufficiently, prayeth him with feare.</aside>

<aside>Iob conuinced the former three with sound answers of this last and most arrogant with silence.</aside>

Where wast thou when I layd the founda- <sup>5</sup> tions of the earth? tel me if thou hast vnderstanding. Who set the measures therof, if thou know? or who stretched out <sup>6</sup> the line vpon it? <sup>7</sup> Vpon what are the foundations therof grounded? or who let downe the corner stone therof, when <sup>8</sup> the morning starres praised me together, and al the sonnes of God made iubilation? Who shut in the sea with doores <sup>9</sup> when it brake forth proceding as it were out of a matrice? When I made a clowde the garment therof, and wrapped it <sup>10</sup> in darkenes as in cloutes of infancie. <sup>11</sup> I compassed it with my boundes, and put barre and doores. And I sayd: Hither- to thou shalt come, and shalt not procede farder, & here thou <sup>12</sup> shalt breake thy swelling waues. Didst thou after thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning his place? <sup>13</sup> And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking <sup>14</sup> them, and hast thou shaken the impious out of it? <sup>15</sup> The seale shal be restored as clay and shal stand as a garment: From the impious their light shal be taken away, and the high arme shal
