were entered into Samaria, Eliseus said: Lord open the eies of
these men, that they may see. And our Lord opened their eies,
and they saw them selues to be in the middes of Samaria.
<sup>21</sup> And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he had sene
them: Shal I strike them, my father? <sup>22</sup> And he said: Thou
shalt not strike them: for thou didst not take them with thy
sword, and thy bow, that thou mayst strike them: but set
bread and water before them, that they may eate and drinke,
and goe to their maister. <sup>23</sup> And a great preparation of meates was sette before them, and they did eate and drinke, and
he dismissed them, and they went away to their maister, and
the robbers of Syria came no more into the Land of Israel.

<sup>24</sup> And it came to passe after these thinges, Benadad the king
of Syria gathered together al his armie, and went vp, and besieged Samaria. <sup>25</sup> And there was a great famine in Samaria:
and so long it was besieged, til the head of an asse was sold
for foure score siluer peeces, & the fourth part of a cabe of pigeons dung, for fiue siluer peeces. <sup>26</sup> And when the king
of Israel passed by the wall, a certayne woman cried out to
him, saying: Saue me my lord king. <sup>27</sup> Who sayd: No, our
Lord saue thee: how can I saue thee? of the floore, or of the
presse? And the king sayd to her: What ayleth thee? Who
answered: <sup>28</sup> This woman sayd to me: Geue thy sonne, that
we may eate him to day, & my sonne we wil eate to morrow.
<sup>29</sup> We therfore boyled my sonne, and did eate him. And I sayd
to her the next day: Geue thy sonne, that we may eate him.
Who hath hid her sonne. <sup>30</sup> Which when the king had
heard, he rent his garmentes, and passed by the wal. And
al the people saw the hearecloth, which he ware next vpon
his flesh. <sup>31</sup> And the king sayd: These thinges doe God to
me, and these adde he, if the head of Eliseus the sonne of
Saphat shal stand vpon him this day. <sup>32</sup> But Eliseus sate in
his house, and the ancientes sate with him. He therfore sent
a man before: and before that messenger came, he sayd to
the ancientes: Doe you know that this murderers sonne
hath sent to cut of my head? See therfore, when the messenger shal come, shut the doore, and suffer him not to enter in:
for behold the sound of his maisters feete is behinde him.
<sup>33</sup> Whiles he was yet speaking to them, the messenger appeared, which came to him. And he sayd: Behold, this so great
euil is of our Lord: what shal I looke for more of our Lord?
