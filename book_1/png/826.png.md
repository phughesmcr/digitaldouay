<sup>13</sup> And Ezechias rejoyced in their coming, and he shewed them the house of aromatical spices, and gold and siluer, and diuerse precious odours, oyntmentes also, and the house of his vessels, and al that he had in his treasures. There was not any thing which Ezechias shewed them, not in his house, and in al his powre. <sup>14</sup> And Isaie the prophete came to king Ezechias, and sayd to him: What sayd these men? or from whence came they to thee? To whom Ezechias said: From a far countrie they came to me out of Babylon. <sup>15</sup> But he answered: What saw they in thy house? Ezechias sayd: They saw al things whatsoeuer are in my house: there is nothing that I haue not shewed them in my treasures. <sup>16</sup> Isaie therfore said to Ezechias, heare the word of our Lord: <sup>17</sup> Behold the daies shal come, & al things shal be taken away, that are in thy house, and that thy fathers haue layd vp vntil this day, into Babylon: there shal not anie thing remayne, sayth our Lord. <sup>18</sup> Yea of the children also that come forth of thee, whom thou shalt beget shalbe taken away, and they shal be eunuches in the palace of the king of Babylon. <sup>19</sup> Ezechias said to Isaie: The word of our Lord which thou hast spoken is good: be there peace and truth in my daies. <sup>20</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ezechias, and al his strength, and how he made a poole, and a conduice, and brought waters in to the citie, are not these things writen in the Booke of the wordes of the daies of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>21</sup> And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and Manasses his sonne reigned for him.

CHAP. XXI.

*For the enormious impietie of Manasses, 10. God threatneth destruction of the kingdom. 16. He spilleth innocent bloud, 18. dieth, and his sonne Amon reigneth also wickedly: 23. is slaine by his seruantes, and his sonne Iosias reigneth.*

<sup>1</sup> TWELVE yeares old was Manasses, when he began to reigne, & he reigned fiue and fiftie yeares in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was haphsiba. <sup>2</sup> And he did euil in the sight of our Lord, acording to the idols of the Nations, which our Lord destroyed from the face of the children of Israel. <sup>3</sup> And he was turned, and built the excelses, which Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he sette vp. altars to Baal, and made groues, as Achab the king of Israel had done: and he adored al the host of heauen, and worshipped it.
