for our Lord the God of hostes: because the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenant: thy altars haue they destroyed, & thy prophetes they haue slaine with the sword, & I alone am leaft, & they seeke my life to take it away. <sup>11</sup> And he said to him: Come forth, and stand in the mount before our Lord: and behold our Lord passeth, and a great winde, and strong ouerthrowing mountaynes, and breaking rockes before our Lord: not in the winde is our Lord, and after the winde an earth quake: not in the earth quake is our Lord: <sup>12</sup> and after the earth quake fire: not in the fire is our Lord, and after the fire a whistling of a gentle winde. <sup>13</sup> Which when Elias had heard, he couered his face with his mantel, and coming forth stood in the doore of the caue, and behold a voyce vnto him, saying: What doest thou here Elias? <sup>14</sup> And he answered: With zele haue I beene zelous for our Lord the God of hostes: because the children of Israel haue forsaken thy couenant: thyn altars they haue destroyed, and thy prophetes they haue slaine with the sword, and I alone am leaft, and they seeke my life to take it away. <sup>15</sup> And our Lord sayd to him: Goe, and returne into thy way by the desert of Damascus: and when thou art come thither thou shalt anoint Hazael king ouer Syria, <sup>16</sup> and Iehu the sonne of Namsi thou shalt anoynt king ouer Israel: and Eliseus the sonne of Saphat, which is of Abelmuela, thou shalt anoynt prophet for thee. <sup>17</sup> And it shal be, whosoeuer shal escape the sword of Hazael, him Iehu shal kil: and whosoeuer shal escape the sword of Iehu, him shal Eliseus kil. <sup>18</sup> And I wil leaue me in Israel seuen thousand men, whose knees haue not beene bowed before Baal, and euerie mouth, that hath not adored him kyssing his handes. <sup>19</sup> Elias therfore departing thence, found Eliseus the sonne of Saphat, ploughing with twelue yoke of oxen, and he was one of them that ploughed with twelue yoke of oxen: and when Elias came to him, he cast his mantel vpon him. <sup>20</sup> Who forthwith leauing the oxen ranne after Elias, and said: Let me kisse, I pray thee, my father, and my mother, and so I wil folow thee. And he sayd to him: Goe, and returne: for that which was my part, I haue donne to thee. <sup>21</sup> And returning from him, he tooke a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and sod the flesh with the plough of the oxen, and gaue to the people, and they did eate: and rysing vp he departed, and folowed Elias, & ministred to him.

<aside>Elias knew no other at that instant in the tenne tribes, that were not partakers in idolatrie; but there were in deede seuen thousand (v. 18.) that bow- ed not their knees to Baal. And the whole kingdom of Iuda obserued true religion, where Asa then reigned, and after him Iosaphat: both good kinges, chap. 15. v. 11. 24. 3. Par. 15. & 17.</aside>

<aside>Elias pro- phecied that these two should be kinges, and cast his cloke ouer Elizeus. v. 19 Elizeus declared to Hazael, that he should be king. 4. Reg 8. an other pro- phet annoin- ted Iehu. 4. Reg. 9.</aside>
