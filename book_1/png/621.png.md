# Samuel. Saul.

## Of Kinges. Chap. XV.

Saul is commanded vtterly to destroy the Amalecites. 8. but he taking Agag their king spared his life, & chiefe of the praye. 10. For which disobedience (10. though pretending that the best thinges were reserued for sacrifice) he is deposed from his kingdom. 24. Then acknowledgeth his fault. 31. Samuel cutteth Agag in peeces 35. and mourneth for Saul.

<sup>1</sup> And Samuel said to Saul: Our Lord sent me to annoint thee king ouer his people Israel; now therefore heare the voice of our Lord: <sup>2</sup> Thus sayth the Lord of hostes: I haue recounted whatsoeuer Amalec hath done to Israel: how he resisted them in the way when they came vp out of Ægypt. <sup>3</sup> Now therefore goe, and strike Amalec, and destroy al that he hath: spare him not, and couet not ought of his thinges: but kil from man vnto woman, both childe & suckling, oxe and sheepe, camel and asse. <sup>4</sup> Saul therefore commanded the people, and numbered them as it were lambes: two hundred thousand footemen, & ten thousand of the men of Iuda. <sup>5</sup> And when Saul was come vnto the citie of Amalec, he laid ambushementes in the torrent. <sup>6</sup> And Saul said to the Cineite: Goe ye, retyre and depart from Amalec: lest perhaps I wrappe thee in with him. for thou hast done mercie with al the children of Israel, when they descended out of Ægypt. And the Cineite departed out of the middes of Amalec. <sup>7</sup> And Saul stroke Amalec from Heuila, vntil thou come to Sur, which is ouer against Ægypt. <sup>8</sup> And he apprehended Agag the king of Amalec aliue: but al the comon people he slewe in the edge of the sword. <sup>9</sup> And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best flockes of sheepe and heardes, and the garmentes and rammes, and al thinges, that were fayre, neither would they destroy them: but whatsoeuer was vile and refuse, that they destroyed. <sup>10</sup> And the word of our Lord was made to Samuel, saying: <sup>11</sup> It repenteth me that I haue made Saul king: because he hath forsaken me, & hath not fulfilled my wordes in worke. And Samuel was strooken sadde, and cried to our Lord al the night. <sup>12</sup> And when Samuel had risen in the night, to goe to Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, that Saul was come into Carmelus, and had erected to him selfe a triumphant arch, and returning was passed, and gone into Galgal. Samuel therefore came to Saul, and Saul offered an holocaust to our Lord of the first of the prayes,
