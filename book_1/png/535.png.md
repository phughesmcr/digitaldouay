<sup>23</sup> Now therefore, quoth he, take away strange goddes out of the middes of you, and incline your hartes to our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>24</sup> And the people said to Iosue: We wil serue our Lord God, and wil be obedient to his preceptes. <sup>25</sup> Iosue therefore in that day made a couenant, and proposed to the people preceptes and iudgementes in Sichem. <sup>26</sup> He wrote also al these wordes in the volume of the law of our Lord: and he tooke a very great stone, and put it vnder the oke, that was in the Sanctuarie of our Lord: <sup>27</sup> and said to al the people: Behold this stone shal be a testimonie for you, that it hath heard al the wordes of our Lord, which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you wil denie, and lye to our Lord your God. <sup>28</sup> And he dismist the people, euerie one into their possession. <sup>29</sup> And after these thinges Iosue the sonne of Nun the seruant of our Lord died, being a hundred and ten yeares old: <sup>30</sup> and they buried him in the coastes of his possession in Thamnathsare, which is situated in the mountaine of Ephraim, on the North part of mount Gaas. <sup>31</sup> And Israel serued our Lord al the daies of Iosue, and of the ancientes, that liued a long time after Iosue, and that had knowen al the workes of our Lord which he had done in Israel. <sup>32</sup> The bones also of Ioseph which the children of Israel had taken out of Ægypt, they buried in Sichem, in part of the field, which Iacob had bought of the sonnes of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a hundred yong ewes, and it was in the possession of the sonnes of Ioseph. <sup>33</sup> Eleazar also the sonne of Aaron died: and they buried him in Gabaath of Phinees his sonne, which was geuen him in mount Ephraim.

ANNOTATIONS.

CHAP. XXIIII.

<aside>This renouation of the same couenãt prefigured the law of the new Testament. *Aug. q. 30. in Iosue.*</aside>

<aside>To the more confusion of reasonable creatures wilfully offending, vnsensible things are made witnesses, because they euer obey Gods wil, which is the best maner of hearing. *Theod. q. 19. in Iosue.*</aside>

<aside>If Iosue writ the rest of this booke, then Samuel added these last verses. *Hist. schol.*</aside>

<aside>Iosephs Mausoleum (or famous sepulchre) remained in Sichem in S. Hieroms time, as he witnesseth. *Tradit. Hebra. in Gen. prope finem.*</aside>

[^1] *They serued false goddes.*] It is euident by this place, that Thare, and some other progenitors of Israel sometimes serued false goddes, from which they were reduced: but Abraham was euer preserued in true religion; and the whole familie of Thare was therefore preserued in Chaldea. *S. Augustin li. 16. c. 13. de ciuit.* Likewise Theoderet, *q. 18. in Iosue*, and other both ancient and late writers teach the same, as is already noted. *pag. 203.*

[^2] *They burie.*] In that no mention is made of mourning for Iosue, S. Hierom noteth a mysterie, and a special point of Christian doctrin: It semeth to me (saith he *Epist. ad 42. Mansiones. 31.*) that in Marie prophecie is dead, in Moyses and Aaron, an end is put to the law and priesthood of the Iewes. For so much as they could neither passe into the land of promise, nor bring the beleuing people out of the wildernes of this world. And (*Mans. 34.*) Aaron (sayeth he) was mourned, (and so was Moyses) Iesus is not mourned, that is, in the law was desolation but (*subdiaphora*) in the Gospel is passage to paradise.
