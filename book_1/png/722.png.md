# Third booke

transgressours, to which end and purpose, as r that God had singularly
selected three more renowned Patriarches, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob,
preserving them by his special grace from idolatrie, and from wicked wayes
of most peoples and nations, blessed their seede, not in the whole progenie
of the two former, but in Iacob onlie, whom he otherwise named Israel,
multiplying his children excedingly, yea most of al (which was most maruelous) in harde persecution: then bringing them forth of the fornace of
Egypt, in his strong hand, as is recorded in the former age, at last his

<aside>Diuine lawes.</aside>

Diuine Maiestie deliuered to them his perfect and eternal Law, consigned in two tables, distributed into tenne precepts, teaching them their

<aside>Moral.</aside>

proper duties first towards himselfe their God and Lord, then towards ech
other. Adding moreouer for the practise and execution therof, other particu-

<aside>Ceremonial</aside>

lar precepts of two sortes, to witte, Ceremonial prescribing certaine determinate maner and rites, in obseruing the commandements of the first table pertaining to God: and Iudicial lawes directing in particular how to fulfil the

<aside>Iudicial</aside>

commandements of the second table, concerning our duties towards our neighbours. So we see the whole law is nothing els, but to loue God aboue al, <sup>Mat. 22.</sup>
and our neighbours as our selues. The maner of performing al, is to
beleue and hope in one onlie Lord God, honour and serue him
alone, who made al of nothing, conserueth al, wil iudge al, and render to
al their asking deserts; and therfore fully to confirme this point, he beginneth his
commandements with expresse prohibition of al false and imaginarie goddes,

<aside>Onely God to be serued with diuine honour.</aside>

saying: (Exod. 20. v. 3.) Thou shalt not haue strange goddes, & after
threates to the transgressours, and recital of the other nine commandements,
he concludeth (v. 23.) with repetition of the first, saying: You shal not
make goddes of siluer, nor goddes of gold shal you make to you.
The same is repeted and explaned (Deut. 5.) And in the next chapter Moyses
exhorting the people saith: Heare Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
And God himselfe speaking againe sayth: (Exod. 23.) See ye that I am
onlie, and there is no other God besides me. The royal prophet Dauid
(2 Reg. 22. and psalm. 17.) who is God but our God? and in sundrie other
places the same doctrine of one God is grounded, confirmed, and established.

<aside>The B. Trinitie</aside>

The Mysterie of the B. Trinitie, or of three Diuine Persons, is no lesse true
and certaine, then that there is but one God, though not so manifest to reason,
nor so expressly taught in the old Testament, yet beleued then also, and often
insinuated, where God is expressed by names of the plural number: as Elohim,
Elim, Eloh, Saddai, Adonai, Tsebaoth: which import pluralitie of Persons
in God, who is but one nature and substance. Distinction also of Persons
in God is deduced (Exod. 31.) God saying: I wil cal in the name of the
Lord. That is (as S. Augustin and other fathers expound it) the second
Person by his grace maketh his seruants to cal vpon God. More distinctly <sup>q. 154. in</sup>
