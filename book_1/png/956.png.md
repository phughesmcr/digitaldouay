3. *Reg. 15:4. Reg. 21.* yet an abusing of the brasen serpent, for which Eze-
chias destroyed it 4. *Reg. 18.* yet be touched not the images of Cherubims in
the Temple, which none but infideles sought to destroy. And Osee the Pro-
phet (*ch. 3.*) bewayleth the want of Theraphim or Images, amongst
other sacred thinges, Sacrifice, Altar, and Ephod. Whereby the ancient Rab-
bins proue very wel, that Images of Angels ( and the same of other
Sainctes ) are not contrarie to the Decalogue, but the images of Idoles.

[^1] Good workes were rewarded, and bad punished, *3. Reg. 9.* and the
whole historie of this age testifieth the same. Whereby also may be obser-
ued, that some iust men fel from their iustice, as Salomon, *3. Reg. 11. 3.*
*Reg. 11. 1. 4. Reg. 12. 2. Par. 24. Osias. 2. Paral. 26.* Others from
wickednes returned to pietie, as Manasses *4. Reg. 23. 2. Par. 33.* the
multitude of the people very often much folowing the disposition of their
kinges. Special State of life not commanded by the law, was voluntarily
professed, and obserued by some Prophetes, and their disciples, called the
children of Prophetes, keping particular Rules, and wearing distinct
habite. *4. Reg. 1. 2. 4.* The orders of Nazarites, and Rechabites institu-
ted before, continued stil. *Amos. 2. Ierem. 35.* Al which were very exam-
plar figures of Religious State, and Orders in the new Testament,
and perpetual chastitie of clergie men embraced by such, as folow Euangelical
counsailes, proposed, and not commanded by our Sauiour. To which S. Paul
likewise exhorteth, though there be no precept therof to anie, before they bind
themselues.

Exequies for the dead were continually kept, as the sacred historie wit-
nesseth, recording where and with what solemnitie the kinges were buried.
Which would be ouerlong, & nedeles to recite: the like is also writen of some
Prophetes. *3. Reg. 13. 4. Reg. 23.* Holie Tobias by example, and fatherlie
admonition exhorted his sonne, to do workes of mercie, not only to
the liuing, but also to the dead. Put thy bread, and thy wine vpon the
sepulture of the iust. *c. 4.* Isaias, *ch. 57.* as the Iewes both vnderstood and
practised, prayed, that peace be geuen to the iust, in his couch, or
resting place after his death. Of the general Resurrection, Elias transla-
tion is a figure, who yet liuing sheweth, that God can and wil restore al men
to life againe in their bodies, after death, as he conserued him, and Enoch in
their mortal bodies without corruption. Ezechiel also prophecieth of the
Resurrection of the dead, applying it mystically to spiritual resurrection,
and restauration of Israel to former state. *ch. 37.* Of the last Iudgment, and
eternal glorie to the good, and euerlasting paine to the wicked, Salomon
agreeably to the doctrin of other Prophetes, discourseth, in his booke of Ecclesia-
stes, namely *ch. 3. 11.* and in the last concludeth thus: Let vs al together
heare the end of speaking: Feare God, and obserue his command-
mentes:
