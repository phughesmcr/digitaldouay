# CHAP. IX.

The people repenting in fasting and sackcloth, put away their wives of strange nations. 5. Esdras confesseth Gods benefits, and the peoples ingratitude. 32. prayeth for them, and maketh league with God.

<sup>1</sup>And in the foure and twenteth day of the moneth the children of Israel came together in fasting and sacke-clothes, and earth vpon them. <sup>2</sup>And the seede of the children of Israel was separated from euerie strange childe: and they stood, and confessed their sinnes, and the iniquities of their fathers. <sup>3</sup>And they rose vp to stand: and they read in the volume of the law of our Lord their God, foure times in a day, and foure times they confessed, and adored our Lord their God. <sup>4</sup>And there arose vpon the steppe of the Leuites Iosue, and Bani, Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they cried with a lowde voice to our Lord their God. <sup>5</sup>And the Leuites Iosue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Odaia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, Blesse our Lord your God from eternitie to eternitie: and let them blesse the high name of thy glorie in al blessing & praise. <sup>6</sup>Thou the same o Lord, alone thou hast made heauen, & al the host therof: the earth & al thinges that are in it: the seas and al thinges that are therin: and thou dost giue life to al these: and the host of heaue adoreth thee. <sup>7</sup>Thou the same o Lord God, which didst choose Abram, & broughtest him out of the fire of the Chaldees, and gauest him the name Abraham. <sup>8</sup>And thou didst finde his hart faithful before thee: and thou madest a couenante with him, that thou wouldest geue him the land of the Chananite, of the Hetheite, and of the Amorrheite, and of the Pherezeite, and of the Iebuseite, & of the Gergeseite, to geue vnto his seede: and thou hast fulfilled thy wordes, because thou art iust. <sup>9</sup>And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Ã†gypt: & their crie thou didst heare vpon the Read sea. <sup>10</sup>And thou gauest signes & wonders in Pharao, and in al his seruants, and in al the people of his land: for thou didst know that they had done proudly against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as also at this day. <sup>11</sup>And thou didst diuide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea in drie land: but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into the rough waters. <sup>12</sup>And in a piller of a cloude thou wast their leader by day, and in a piller of fire
