But if my fathers malice shal perseuer against thee, I wil reuele thyne eare, and wil dismisse thee, that thou mayst goe in peace, and our Lord be with thee, as he hath beene with my father. <sup>15</sup> And if I liue, thou shalt doe me the mercie of our Lord; but if I die, <sup>16</sup> thou shalt not take away thy mercie from my house for euer, when our Lord shal haue rooted out the enemies of Dauid, euerie one out of the land, take he away Ionathas from his house, and our Lord require it of the handes of Dauids enemies. <sup>17</sup> Ionathas therefore made a league with the house of Dauid: and our Lord required it of the handes of Dauids enemies. <sup>18</sup> And Ionathas added to sweare vnto Dauid, because he loued him, for as his owne soule, so he loued him. <sup>19</sup> And Ionathas sayd to him: To morowe are the calendes, and thou shalt be asked for: <sup>20</sup> for thy sitting wil be inquired of til after to morowe. Thou shalt therefore goe downe in hast, and shalt come to the place, where thou must be hid in the day, when it is lawful to worke, and thou shalt sit beside the stone, which is named Ezel. <sup>21</sup> And I wil shoote three arrowes nere it, and wil shoote as it were exercising my self at a marke. <sup>22</sup> I wil send also a boy saying to him: Goe, and fetch me the arrowes. <sup>23</sup> If I shal say to the boy: Loe the arrowes are on this side thee, take them vp: come thou to me, because there is peace to thee, and there is no euil, our Lord liueth. But if I shal speake thus to the boy: Loe the arrowes are beyond thee: Goe in peace, because our Lord hath dimissed thee. <sup>24</sup> And concerning the word which I and thou haue spoken, our Lord be betwen thee and me for euer. <sup>25</sup> Dauid therefore was hidde in the fielde, and the calendes came, and the king sate downe to eate bread. <sup>26</sup> And when the king was sette vpon his chaire (according to the custome)
