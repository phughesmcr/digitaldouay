<sup>14</sup> And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day, wherein our Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy handes: behold he is thy leader. And Barac went downe from mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him. <sup>15</sup> And our Lord terrified Sisara, and al his chariotes, and al the multitude in the edge of the sword at the sight of Barac: in so much, that Sisara leaping downe from his chariote, fled a foote, <sup>16</sup> and Barac pursued the chariotes fleeing, and the armie vnto Haroseth of the gentiles, and al the multitude of the enemies was vtterly destroyed. <sup>17</sup> But Sisara fleeing came to the tent of Iahel the wife of Haber the Cineite, for there was peace betwixt Iabin the king of Asor, and the house of Haber the Cineite. <sup>18</sup> Iahel therfore going forth to meete Sisara, said to him: Come in to me my Lord, come in, feare not. Who being entred into her tabernacle, and covered of her with a cloke, <sup>19</sup> said to her: Geue me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirstie. Who opened a bottle of milke, and gaue him to drinke, and couered him. <sup>20</sup> And Sisara said to her: Stand before the doore of the tabernacle, and when any shal come asking thee, and saying: Is there any man here? Thou shalt say: There is none. <sup>21</sup> Iahel therfore the wife of Haber tooke a nayle of the tabernacle, taking withal a hammer also: and going in secretly, and with silence she put the nayle vpon the temple of his head, and striking it with the hammer, fastened it into his braine euen to the ground: who ioyning deepe sleepe and death together, faynted, and died. <sup>22</sup> And behold Barac folowing Sisara came: & Iahel going forth to meete him, said to him: Come, and I wil shew thee the man whom thou seekest. Who when he was entered in vnto her, saw Sisara lying dead, and the nayle fastened in his temples. <sup>23</sup> Therfore God that day humbled Iabin the king of Chanaan before the children of Israel: <sup>24</sup> which increased daily, and with strong hand oppressed Iabin the king of Chanaan, til they destroyed him.
