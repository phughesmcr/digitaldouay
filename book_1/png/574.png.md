Michas said: Abide with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I wil geue thee euerie yeare tenne siluer peeces, and duble liuerie, and the thinges that be necessarie for victual <sup>11</sup> He was content, and abode with the man, and was <sup>12</sup> vnto him as one of his sonnes. <sup>13</sup> And Michas filled his hand, and had the yong man for a priest with him, saying: <sup>14</sup> Now I know that God wil do me good hauing a priest of the Leuitical kinde.

## Chap. XVIII.

*First sending spies to discouer,* <sup>11</sup> *six hundred armed men of the tribe of Dan goe to seeke possessions.* <sup>14</sup> *By the way they take the idol, and idolatrical priest from Michas,* <sup>27</sup> *surprise the towne of Lais,* <sup>30</sup> *and there set vp idolatrie.*

<sup>1</sup> IN those dayes there was not a king in Israel, and the tribe of Dan sought possession for it selfe, that it might dwel therein: for vntil that day it had[^1] not receiued a lotte among the other tribes. <sup>2</sup> Therfore the children of Dan sent fiue men of their stocke and familie most valiant from Saraa and Esthaol, that they might view the land, and diligently behold it, and they said to them: Goe, and consider the land. Who going forward when they were come into mount Ephraim, and had entered into the house of Michas, they rested there: <sup>3</sup> and knowing the voice of the yong man the Leuite, and vsing his lodging, they said to him: Who brought thee hither? What doest thou here? For what cause wouldest thou come hither? <sup>4</sup> Who answered them: These, and these thinges hath Michas done to me, & hath hyred me for wages to be his priest. <sup>5</sup> And they desired him that he would consult[^2] the Lord, that they might know whether they should goe on a prosperous iourney, and the thing should haue effect. <sup>6</sup> Who answered them: Goe in peace: The Lord regardeth your way, and the iourney that you goe. <sup>7</sup> The fiue men therfore going came to Lais, & they saw the people dwelling in it without any feare, according to the custome of the Sidonians, secure and quiet, no man at al resisting them, & of greate riches, and separated farre from Sidon and from al men. <sup>8</sup> And returning to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, and asking what they had done they answered them: <sup>9</sup> Arise, and let vs goe vp to them: for we haue seene the Land exceeding rich and plentiful: neglect not, slacke not: let vs goe, and possesse it, it wil be no labour.

[^1]: Their whole portio was as- signed (Ios. 19) but through their owne slouth they possessed not al of it, so that hitherto the greatest part was not recei- ued.

[^2]: They meane the false god which the a- postate Leuite serued.

<aside>was of no va- lue, where was neither true vocation in the annointed (for he descen ded not of Aaron, but of Moses, chap. 18. v. 30.) nor authoritie in him that vsed this ceremony b An Apostata Leuite was ac- counted more sufficient then an idolatrical priest to serue an idol. so he that is a Priest or a Deacon once catholik- ly consecra- ted, is a suf- ficient (yea too sufficient) a minister with prote- stantes.</aside>
