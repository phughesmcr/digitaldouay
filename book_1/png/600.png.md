<sup>7</sup> And the Philisthims were afrayd, saing: God is come into the campe. And they mourned, saing: <sup>8</sup> Woe to vs: for there was not so great reioysing yesterday and the day before: woe to vs. Who shal keepe vs from the hand of these high Goddes? these be the Goddes, that stricke Ægypt with al plague, in the desert. <sup>9</sup> Take courage, and be men, ye Philisthijms: lest you be seruantes to the Hebrewes, as they also haue serued you: take courage and fight. <sup>10</sup> The Philisthijms therfore fought, and Israel was slaine, and euerie man fled into his tabernacle: and there was made an exceding great plague: and there fel of Israel thirtie thousand footemen. <sup>11</sup> And the arke of God was taken: the two sonnes also of Heli died, Ophni and Phinees. <sup>12</sup> And a man of Beniamin running out of the battle aray, came into Silo that day; his garment rent, and sprinkled on his head with dust. <sup>13</sup> And when he was come, Heli sate vpon a stoole ouer against the way looking.
