<sup>10</sup> first planted. But when man shal be dead, and naked and consumed, where is he I pray? <sup>11</sup> As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and a riuer made emptie should be dried vp. <sup>12</sup> So man when he is a sleepe shal not rise agayne, til heauen perish, he shal not awake, nor rise vp out of his sleepe. <sup>13</sup> Who wil grant me this, that in hel thou protect me, and hide me, til thy furie passe, and appoynt me a time, wherin thou wilt remember me? <sup>14</sup> Shal man that is dead, thinkest thou, liue agayne? al the daies, in which I am now in warfare, I expect vntil my change do come. <sup>15</sup> Thou shalt cal me, and I shal answer thee: to the worke of thy handes thou shalt reach thy right hand. <sup>16</sup> Thou in dede hast numbred my steppes: but thou wilt spare my sinnes. <sup>17</sup> Thou hast sealed my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured mine iniquitie. <sup>18</sup> A mountaine falling slideth downe, and a rock is remoued out of his place. <sup>19</sup> Waters make stones holow, and with inundation the earth by litle and litle is consumed: and men therfore thou shalt destroy in like maner. <sup>20</sup> Thou hast strengthened him a litle that he might passe away foreuer: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him forth. <sup>21</sup> Whether his children shal be noble, or vnnoble, he :: shal not vnderstand. <sup>22</sup> But yet his flesh whiles he shal liue shal haue sorow, & his soule shal mourne vpon himself.
