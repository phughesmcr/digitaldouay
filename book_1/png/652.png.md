# First Booke

if it had bene an illusion of an euil spirite, it would hardly seme anie praise at al. Fourthly, the diuel could not naturally foretell that Saul and his sonnes, with manie of the people should be slaine the next day, and Dauid reigne after him: neither is it probable, that God reuealed such secretes to euil spirites, whereby men might take more occasion to folow nicromancie. Fiftly, most Fathers and Doctours are of the same iudgement: S. Iustinus Martyr. *102. pag. Dialog. cum Tryphone*. S. Basil. *Epist. 80. ad Eustathium*. S. Ambrose *li. 1. in Luc. 1. 210*. S. Hierom. *in Isaia 7*. Iosephus *li. 6. c. 15. antiq*. and manie other old and late writers. The chiefest argument for the other opinion is the authoritie of Tertullian, *li. de anima*. Procopius and Eucherius vpon this place. and the vncer-taine authors, *Quæstionum apud Iustinum. q. 52. lib. de mirabil. sac. Script*. and *Quæst. 141. Test. utriusq. 17. apud Augustinum, to 10. 3. et. 4*. As for the Protestantes denying, that soules once parted from their bodies, can appeare to anie aliue, S. Augustin confuteth them, both by this example of Samuel, supposing the booke of Ecclesiasticus to be Canonical Scripture, and of Moyses being dead, and Elias yet liuing (whom they hold also to be dead) both appearing with Christ in his transfiguration. *Mat. 17*.

## Chap. XXIX.

*Dauid going with the Philistijms towards the warre, 4. the princes vrge and force the king to send him back.*

<sup>1</sup> Therefore al the companies of the Philistijms were gathered together into Aphec: and Israel also camped vpon the fountaine, which was in Iezrahel. <sup>2</sup> And the princes in dede of the Philistijms marched in hundreds and thousandes: but Dauid and his men were in the last companie with Achis. <sup>3</sup> And the princes of the Philistijms sayd to Achis: What meane these Hebrewes? And Achis sayd to the princes of the Philistijms: Doe you not knowe Dauid, which was the seruant of Saul the king of Israel, and is with me manie daies, or yeares, and I haue not found any thing in him, since the day that he fled to me, vntil this day? <sup>4</sup> But the princes of the Philistijms were angrie against him, and sayd to him: Let this man returne, and abide in his place, wherein thou hast appointed him, and let him not goe downe with vs into battel, lest he become an aduersarie to vs, when we shal beginne to fight: for how can he otherwise pacifie his lord, but in our heades? <sup>5</sup> Is not this Dauid, to whom they sang in dances, saying: Saul hath strooke his thousandes, & Dauid his ten thousandes? <sup>6</sup> Achis therefore called Dauid, and sayd to him: The Lord liueth, thou art iust, and good in my sight: and thy going out, & thy coming in is with me in the campe: and I haue not found in thee anie euil, since the day that thou camest to me vntil this day: but thou pleasest not the nobles.

[^1]: Soules sometimes appeare after death.

<aside>:: He speaketh by amplifica-tion to make his fast seme more reasona-ble: whereas the time of Dauids abode with him was but foure mo-nethes. *ch. 27. v.7*.</aside>
