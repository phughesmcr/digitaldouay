Concerning the time, and author, it semeth most probable that these thinges happened when Manasses king of Iuda was either in prison in Babylon, or newly restored to his kingdom, who as it semeth permitted the gouernment to the high Priest Eliachim(Chap 4)otherin ise called Ioachim(ch. 15.) & he also wrote this booke, as Philo Chronologus, li. 2 reporteth. From which time they had no warres til the reigne of Ioachaz, about 30 yeares, conformable to the long peace mentioned, chap. 16. v 30. In summe we haue here, not a poeticall Comedie (as Martin Luther shameth not to cal it, in Symposiacis, c. 29 and in his German Preface of Indith) but a sacred Historie (as al former time esteemed it, and the Iewes confesse) of a most valiant Matrone fact, deliuering the people of God from persecution of a cruel Tyranne. The first three chaps is shew the occasion of this danger: the next foure describe the difficulties & distresses therof: other seuen with part of the 15. how Iudith deliuered them from it. In the rest Iudith is much praysed, and she with the whole people prayse God.
