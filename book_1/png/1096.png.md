man, there is none that can open. <sup>15</sup> If he hold in the waters, al things shal be dried: and if he send them forth, they shal ouerthrow the earth. <sup>16</sup> With him is strength and wisedom: he knoweth both the deceiuer, & him that is deceiued. <sup>17</sup> He bringeth counselers to a folish end, and iudges to asto-nishment. <sup>18</sup> He looseth the belt of kings, and girdeth their reines with a corde. <sup>19</sup> He leadeth away Priestes without glo-rie, and supplanteth the great men. <sup>20</sup> Changing the lippe of the true, and taking away the doctrine of the ancientes. <sup>21</sup> He powreth out contempt vpon princes, releeuing them that had bene oppressed. <sup>22</sup> Who reueleth profound thinges out of darkenesse, and bringeth forth the shadow of death into light. <sup>23</sup> Who multiplieth nations, and destroyeth them, and restoreth the destroyed whole agayne. <sup>24</sup> Who changeth the hart of the princes of the people of the earth, and deceiueth them, that they may goe in vayne where is no passage. <sup>25</sup> They shal grope as in the darke, and not in the light, and he shal make them goe amis as druncken men.
