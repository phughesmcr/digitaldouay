<sup>10</sup> Our Lord shal his aduersaries feare: and vpon them shal he thunder in the heauens: our Lord shal iudge the endes of the Earth, and shal geue empire to his king, and shal exalt the horne of his Christ.

<sup>11</sup> And Elcana went into Ramatha, vnto his house: but the childe ministered in the sight of our Lord before the face of Heli the priest.

<sup>12</sup> Moreouer the sonnes of Heli, were the sonnes of Belial, not knowing our Lord, <sup>13</sup> nor the office of priestes to the people: but whosoeuer had immolated a victime, the seruant of the priest came, whiles the flesh was in boyling, and had a flesh hooke with three teeth in his hand, <sup>14</sup> and thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the potte, or into the panne: and al, that the flesh hooke brought vp, the priest tooke to him selfe. so did they to al Israel that came into Silo.

<sup>15</sup> Yea before they burnt the fatte, the seruant of the priest came, and sayd to him that immolated: Geue me flesh, that I may boyle it for the priest: for I wil not take flesh of thee sodde, but raw.

<sup>16</sup> And he that immolated sayd to him: Let the fatte first be burnt to day according to the maner, and take vnto thee how much soeuer thy soule desireth. Who answering said to him: Not so: for thou shalt geue it now, or els I wil take it away by force.

<sup>17</sup> Therfore the sinne of the yong men was exceding great before our Lord: because men detracted from the sacrifice of our Lord.

<sup>18</sup> But Samuel ministred before the face of our Lord: a child, girded with an ephod of linnen.

<sup>19</sup> And his mother made him a litle tunike, which she brought vpon the ordinarie daies, going vp with her husband, to immolate the solemne host.

<sup>20</sup> And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he saied to him: Our Lord render thee seede of this woman, for the vsurie that thou hast geuen our Lord. And they went into their place.

<sup>21</sup> Our Lord therfore visited Anna, and she conceiued, and bare three sonnes, and two daughters: and the childe Samuel was magnified before our Lord.

<sup>22</sup> And Heli was very old, and heard al thinges which his sonnes did to al Israel: and how they slept with the women that wayted at the doore of the tabernacle:

<sup>23</sup> and he sayd to them: Why doe you these kinde of thinges, which I heare, very naughtie thinges, of al the people?

<sup>24</sup> Doe not so my sonnes: for it is not a good report, which I doe heare, that you make the people of our Lord to transgresse.

<sup>25</sup> If man shal sinne against man,

[^1]: Neither Da- uid nor Salo- mon, much lesse anie other King, possessed or iudged the endes of the earth: but Christe coheri- tance reacheth to the endes of the earth. *Psal. 2. 7. 18.*
