And when our Lord shal haue deliuered vs the land, we wil doe in thee mercie and truth <sup>15</sup> She therfore did let them downe by a corde out of a window: for her house ioyned fast to the wall. <sup>16</sup> And she said to them: Goe vp to the mountaines, lest perhaps they meete you returning: and there lie hid three daies, til they returne, and so you shal goe on your way. <sup>17</sup> Who said to her: We shal be quitte from this oath, wherwith thou hast sworne vs: <sup>18</sup> if we entring the Land, there be this purple corde a signe, and thou tie it in the window, by the which thou hast let vs downe: and gather thy father and mother, and brethren and al thy kindred into thy house. <sup>19</sup> He that shal goe forth
