## Chap. X.

<sup>1</sup> And the Philistijms fought agaynst Israel, and the men of Israel fled from the Palestines, and they fel wounded in mount Gelboe. <sup>2</sup> And when the Philistijms were come nere pursuing Saul, and his sonnes, they stroke Ionathas, and Abinadab, and Melchisua the sonnes of Saul. <sup>3</sup> And the battel grewe sore agaynst Saul, and the archers found him, and wounded him with arrowes. <sup>4</sup> And Saul sayd to his esquyer: Draw thy sword, and kil me: lest perhaps these vncircumcised come, and deride me. But his harnes bearer would not, being frighted with feare: Saul therfore caught his sword, and fel vpon it. <sup>5</sup> Which when his harnes bearer had seene, to witte, that Saul was dead, him self also fel vpon his sword, and died. <sup>6</sup> Saul therfore died, and his three sonnes, and al his house fel together. <sup>7</sup> Which when the men of Israel had sene, that dwelt in the champayne, they fled: and Saul and his sonnes being dead, they forsooke their cities, and were dispersed hither and thither: and the Philisthijms came, and dwelt in them. <sup>8</sup> The next day therfore the Philisthijms taking away the spoiles of them that were slayne, found Saul and his sonnes lying on mount Gelboe. <sup>9</sup> And when they had spoyled him, and cut of his head, and stripped him of his armour, they sent into their land, that it should be caried about, and should be shewed in the temples of the Idols, and to the people: <sup>10</sup> and his armour they dedicated in the temple of their god, and the head they nailed vp in the temple of Dagon. <sup>11</sup> When the men of Iabes Galaad had heard this, to witte, al thinges that the Philistijms had done vpon Saul, <sup>12</sup> euerie one of the valiant men arose, and tooke the bodies of Saul and of his sonnes, and brought them into Iabes, and buried their bones vnder an oke, that was in Iabes, and they fasted seuen daies. <sup>13</sup> Saul therfore died for his iniquities, for that he transgressed the commandement of our Lord which he had commanded, and kept it not: yea and besides also consulted the Pythonesse, <sup>14</sup> and trusted not in our Lord: for the which he slewe him, and transferred his kingdome to Dauid the sonne of Isai.
