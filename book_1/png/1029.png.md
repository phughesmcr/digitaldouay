<sup>18</sup> al be blessed, & shal be gathered together to our Lord. <sup>19</sup> My soule, blesse thou our Lord, because he hath deliuered Ierusalem his citie from al her tribulations, the Lord our God. <sup>20</sup> Blessed shal I be if there shal remayne of my seede, to see the glorie of Ierusalem. <sup>21</sup> The gates of Ierusalem shal be built of Saphire and the Emerauld: and al the compasse of the walles therof of precious stone. <sup>22</sup> With white and cleane stone shal al the streates therof be paued: and in the streates therof <sup>23</sup> Alleluia shal be song. Blessed be our Lord, which hath exalted it, and his kingdom be for euer and euer ouer it Amen.

CHAP. XIII.

*Old Tobias dieth at the age of an hundred and two yeares, 5. exhorteth his sonne and nephewes to pietie, foreshewing that Niniue shal be destroyed, and Ierusalem reedified. 14. Yonger Tobias returneth with his familie to Raguel, and dieth happily as he had liued.*

<sup>1</sup> And the wordes of Tobias were ended. And after that Tobias was restored to his sight, he liued two and fourtie yeares, and saw the children of his nephewes. <sup>2</sup> Therefore an hundred and two yeares being accomplished, he was buried honorably in Niniue. <sup>3</sup> For being six and fiftie yeares old he lost the sight of his eies, and being threescore he receiued it agayne. <sup>4</sup> And the rest of his life was in ioy, and with great increase of the feare of God he went forward in peace. <sup>5</sup> And at the houre of his death he called vnto him Tobias his sonne, and his seuen yong sonnes, his nephewes, and sayd to them: <sup>6</sup> The destruction of Niniue is neere: for the word of our Lord fayleth not: and our brethren, which are dispersed from the land of Israel, shal returne to it. <sup>7</sup> And al the desert land therof shal be replenished, and the house of God which is burnt in it, shal agayne be reedified: and thither shal al returne that feare God, <sup>8</sup> and the Gentiles shal forsake their idols, and shal come into Ierusalem, and shal inhabite in it, <sup>9</sup> and al the kings of the earth shal reioyce in it, ado<sup>10</sup>ring the king of Israel. Heare ye therefore my children your father: serue our Lord in truth, and seeke to doe the thinges that please him: <sup>11</sup> and command your children that they doe iustices and almes deedes, that they be mindeful of God, and blesse him at al time in truth, and in al their power.

<aside>Celestial Ierusalem shal be free from al tribulations.</aside>

<aside>No Christian is ignorant (sayth S. Augustine Epist. 86.) that Alleluia is a voice of praise. In English it is, Prayse ye the Lord with ioy.</aside>

[^1]: This can not be vnderstood of the citie of Ierusalem but of the Church of Christ.

[^2]: Gods seruantes must not only expect what shal be commanded, but also seeke to know what they ought to do.
