# Deuteronomie. Chap. XXXIIII.

Moyses seeth the promised land, but is not suffered to goe into it, 5. He dieth at the age of 120. yeares. God burieth his bodie secretly, and al Israel mourne for him thirtie daies. 9. Iosue replenished (by imposition of Moyses handes) with the spirit of God succedeth. 10. But Moyses for his special familiaritie with God, and for most wonderful miracles is commended aboue al other Prophetes.

MOYSES therefore went vp from the champion of Moab vpon mount Nebo, into the toppe of Phasga against Iericho: and our Lord shewed him <sup>1</sup>al. the land of Galaad as farre as Dan, <sup>2</sup>and al Nephthali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and al the Land of Iuda vnto the vtmost sea, <sup>3</sup>and the south part, and the bredth of the plaine of Iericho a citie of palmetrees as farre as Segor. <sup>4</sup>And our Lord said to him: This is the Land, for the which I sware to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, saying: To thy seede wil I geue it. Thou hast seene it with thyne eies, and shalt not passe ouer to it. <sup>5</sup>And Moyses the seruant of our Lord died there, in the land of Moab, our Lord commanding it: <sup>6</sup>and he buried him in the valley of the Land of Moab, against Phogor: and no man hath knowne his sepulchre vntil this present day. <sup>7</sup>Moyses was an hundred and twentie yeares old when he died: his eie was not dimme, neither were his teeth moued. <sup>8</sup>And the children of Israel mourned him in the champion countrie of Moab thirtie daies: and the daies of their mourning that mourned for Moyses were accomplished. <sup>9</sup>And Iosue the sonne of Nun was replenished with the spirit of wisedome, because Moyses did put his handes vpon him. And the children of Israel obeied him: and did as our Lord commanded Moyses. <sup>10</sup>And there rose no more a prophete in Israel as Moyses, whom our Lord had knowen face to face, <sup>11</sup>in al signes and wonders, which he sent by him, to doe in the Land of Ã†gypt to Pharao, and to al his seruantes, and to his whole Land, <sup>12</sup>and al the strong hand, and great meruailes, which Moyses did before al Israel.
