they haue forsaken me, and serued strange goddes, so doe they
also vnto thee. <sup>9</sup> Now therefore heare their voice: but yet
testifie to them, and foretel them the right of the king, that
shal reigne ouer them. <sup>10</sup> Samuel therfore spake al the wordes
of our Lord to the people which had desired a king of him,
<sup>11</sup> and sayd: This shal be the right of the king, that shal reigne
ouer you: Your sonnes he wil take, and put in his chariotes,
and wil make them vnto him the horsemen, and running
footmen before his chariotes, <sup>12</sup> and wil appoynt them his
tribunes, and centurions, and the plowers of his fieldes, and
mowers of his corne, and makers of his armour and of his
chariotes. <sup>13</sup> Your daughters also wil he take to make ointe-
mentes, and to be cookes, and bakers. <sup>14</sup> Your fieldes also,
and vineyardes, and the best oliuetes he wil take away, and
geue to his seruantes. <sup>15</sup> Yea and your corne also, and the
reuenewes of your vineyardes he wil tithe, to geue his eu-
nuches and seruantes. <sup>16</sup> Your seruantes also and handmaides,
and goodliest yong men, and asses he wil take away, and put
in his worke. <sup>17</sup> Your flockes also wil he tithe, yea shal be
his seruantes. <sup>18</sup> And you shal crie in that day from the face
of the king, which you haue chosen you: and our Lord wil
not heare you in that day, because you desired vnto your
selues a king. <sup>19</sup> But the people would not heare the voice
of Samuel, but sayd: Not so: for there shal be a king ouer
vs, <sup>20</sup> and we also wil be as al nations: and our king shal
iudge vs, and shal goe forth before vs, and shal fight our
battels for vs. <sup>21</sup> And Samuel heard al the wordes of the
people, and spake them in the eares of our Lord. <sup>22</sup> And our
Lord said to Samuel: Heare their voice, and appoynt a king
ouer them. And Samuel sayd to the men of Israel: Let euerie
man goe into his citie.

CHAP. VIII.

[^1] Reiected me.] For so much as God had chosen Israel a peculiar people to
him self, and hitherto ruled the same by his Priestes established among them,
and by Iudges extraordinarily raised vp, and sent by him, to deliuer them in
their distresses, their demand now to haue a King, who (after the maner of other
nations) should be their Lord, and haue more dignitie, and authoritie ouer
them, then Dukes or Iudges had, is interpreted, as in effect to reiect God: in
that they disliked, & sought to change his forme of gouernment. And therfore
this request of the people iustly displeased both Samuel and God himself.
