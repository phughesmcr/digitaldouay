farre as the great cesterne, which is in Socho, and asked, and
said: In what place are Samuel and Dauid? And it was told
him: Loe they are in Naioth in Ramatha. <sup>23</sup> And he went
into Naioth in Ramatha, and the Spirit of our Lord came
vpon him, and he walked going, and he prophesied vntil he
came into Naioth in Ramatha. <sup>24</sup> And he stripped himselfe
of his garments, and prophecied with the rest before Samuel,
and sang naked al that day and night. Wherupon there went
out also a prouerb: What is Saul also among the prophetes.

CHAP. XX.

*Ionathas comforteth Dauid, & confirmeth their former league. 18. By an appointed signe* <sup>34</sup> *endeuoring first, but in vaine, to pacifie his father* <sup>35</sup> *certifieth Dauid of his fathers malice against him. 41. They meete againe secretly, and sorowfully part ech from other.*

<sup>1</sup> BVt Dauid also fled from Naioth, which is in Ramatha:
and coming spake before Ionathas: What haue I done?
what is myn iniquitie, and what sinne of myn against thy
father, that he seeketh my life? <sup>2</sup> Who sayd to him: God
forbid, thou shalt not die: for neither wil my father doe any
thing great or litle, vnles he first tel me: this word therefore

and wil say: Let not Ionathas know this, lest perhaps he be
sad. Yea more our Lord liueth, and thy soule liueth, by one
degree only (as I may so say) I and death are diuided. <sup>4</sup> And
Ionathas said to Dauid: Whatsoeuer thy soule shal say to me,

calendes are to morowe, & I after the maner am wont to sitte
beside the king to eate: dismisse me therefore that I may be
hid in the field vntil the euening of the third day. <sup>6</sup> If thy
father looking inquire for me, thou shalt answer him: Dauid
desired me, that he might goe quickly into Bethlehem his

<sup>7</sup> If he shal say, Wel: peace shal be to thy seruant, but if
<sup>8</sup> he be angrie, know that his malice is complete. <sup>†</sup> Doe mercie
therefore toward thy seruant: because thou hast caused me thy
seruant to enter the league of our Lord with thee. but if there
be any iniquitie in me, do thou kil me, and bring me not in to
<sup>9</sup> thy father. <sup>†</sup> And Ionathas sayd: Be this farre from thee, for

[^1]: Saul and his messengers had not the gift of prophecie, as godlie prophetes had by an inherent habite, but transitorie, as Baalams asse had facultie to speake, at one time, but did not afterward speake anie more. *s. Aug. li. 2. q. 1. ad Simplicia.*
