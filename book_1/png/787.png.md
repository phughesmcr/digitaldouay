sayd to her husband; I perceive that this is a holie man of God, which passeth by vs often. <sup>10</sup> Let vs therfore make him a litle chamber, and sette him a litle bed in it, and a table, and a stoole, and a candlesticke, that when he commeth to vs he may tarie there. <sup>11</sup> There came therfore a certayne day, and coming he turned in to the chamber, and rested there. <sup>12</sup> And he sayd to Giezi his seruant: Call this Sunamite. Who when he had called her, and she stoode before him, <sup>13</sup> he sayd to his seruant: Speake to her: Behold thou hast diligently ministred to vs in al thinges, what wilt thou that I doe for thee? hast thou any busines, and wilt thou that I speake to the king, or the general of the warrefare? Who answered: I dwel in the middes of myne owne people. <sup>14</sup> And he sayd: What wil she then that I doe for her? And Giezi sayd: Aske not: for she hath no sonne, and her husband is old. <sup>15</sup> He therfore commanded him to cal her: who when she was called, and stoode before the doore, <sup>16</sup> he sayd to her: At this tyme, this self same houre, if life accompanie, thou shalt haue a sonne in thy wombe. But she answered: Doe not I beseech thee my lord, man of God, doe not lie to thy handmayd. <sup>17</sup> And the woman conceiued, and brought forth a sonne in that time, and in the self same houre, that Eliseus had sayd. <sup>18</sup> And the childe grewe. And vpon a certaine day, when going forth he went to his father, vnto the reapers, <sup>19</sup> he sayd to his father: My head aketh, my head aketh. But he said to his seruant, take him, and bring him to his mother, <sup>20</sup> who when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she sette him vpon her knees vntil noone, and he dyed. <sup>21</sup> And she went vp, and laid him vpon the bed of the man of God, and shut the doore: and going forth <sup>22</sup> called her husband, and sayd: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of the seruantes, and an asse, that I may runne to the man of God, and returne. <sup>23</sup> Who sayd to her: For what cause doest thou goe to him? The Calendes be not to day, nor the Sabbath. Who answered: I wil goe. <sup>24</sup> And she sadled the asse, and commanded her seruant: driue, and make hast, make no stay in going. And doe that which I command thee. <sup>25</sup> She therfore went forward, and came to the man of God into mount Carmel: and when the man of God saw her ouer against him, he said to Giezi his seruant: Behold that Sunamite. <sup>26</sup> Goe therfore to meete her, and say to her: Is al wel about thee, and about thy husband,
