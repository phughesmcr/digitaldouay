Ioiada the high priest annoynteth and crowneth Ioas king. 12. causeth Athalia to be slaine; 16. idolatrie to be destroyed. 18. and Gods seruice aduanced.

<sup>1</sup> And in the seuenth yeare Ioiada taking courage, tooke the centurions, to witte, Azarias the sonne of Ieroham, and Ismahel the sonne of Iohanan, Azarias also the sonne of Obed, and Maasias the sonne of Adaias, and Elisaphat the sonne of Zechri: and made a couenant with them. <sup>2</sup> Who going about Iuda, gathered together the Leuites out of al the cities of Iuda, and the princes of the families of Israel, and they came into Ierusalem. <sup>3</sup> Therfore al the multitude made a couenant with the king in the house of God: and Ioiada sayd to them: Behold the kinges sonne shal reigne, as our Lord hath spoken, vpon the sonnes of Dauid. <sup>4</sup> This therfore is the thing which you shal doe. <sup>5</sup> The third part of you that come to the Sabbath, of the Priestes, and of Leuites, and of porters shal be in the gates: and a third part at the kinges house: and a third at the gate, which is called of the Fundation: but let al the rest of the common people be in the courtes of the house of our Lord. <sup>6</sup> Neither let anie other enter into the house of our Lord, but the Priestes, and they that minister of the Leuites: let them onlie goe in, because they are sanctified and let al the rest of the multitude obserue the watches of our Lord. <sup>7</sup> And let the Leuites enuiron the king, hauing euerie one their weapons: (and if anie other shal enter into the temple, let him be slayne) and let them be with the king both coming in, and going out. <sup>8</sup> The Leuites therfore, & al Iuda did according to al thinges, which Ioiada the high Priest had commanded: and they tooke euerie one the men that were vnder them, and came by the order of the Sabbath, with them that had fulfilled the Sabbath, and were to goe forth. For Ioiada the high Priest permitted not the companies to depart, which were accustomed to succede one an other euerie weeke. <sup>9</sup> And Ioiada the Priest gaue to the centurions the speares, and the shieldes, and targattes of king Dauid, which he had consecrated in the house of our Lord. <sup>10</sup> And he appoynted al the people of them that held weapons on the right side of the temple, vnto the left syde of the temple, before the altar, and the temple, round about the king.
