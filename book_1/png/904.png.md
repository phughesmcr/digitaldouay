would ordayne thee ouer his throne , king <sup>8</sup> of the Lord thy God. Because God loueth Israel, and wil preserue it for euer: therfore hath he sette thee king ouer it, to doe iudgementes and iustice. <sup>9</sup> And she gaue to the king an hundred twentie talentes of gold, and spices exceding much, and most pretious stones: there were not such spices, as these, which the Queene of Saba gaue to King Salomon. <sup>10</sup> But the seruantes of Hiram also with the seruantes of Salomon brought gold from Ophir, and Thymtrees, and most pretious stones: <sup>11</sup> wherof the king made, to witte, of the Thymtrees, stayes in the house of our Lord, and in the kinges house, harpes also and psalteries for the singing men: neuer were there seene such trees in the Land of Iuda. <sup>12</sup> And king Salomon gaue to the Queene of Saba al thinges that she would, and that she asked, and manie moe thinges then she brought to him: who returning, went into her countrie with her seruantes. <sup>13</sup> And the weight of the gold, that was brought to Salomon euerie yeare was six hundred sixtie six talentes of gold: <sup>14</sup> beside that summe, which the legates of diuers nations, and the merchantes were accustomed to bring, and al the kinges of Arabia, and the Dukes of the landes, which brought gold and siluer to Salomon. <sup>15</sup> King Salomon therfore made two hundred golden speares, of the summe of six hundred peces of gold, which were spent in euerie speare: <sup>16</sup> also three hundred golden shieldes of three hundred peces of gold, with which euerie shield was couered: and the king put them in the armarie, which was besette with a wood. <sup>17</sup> The king also made a great throne of iuorie, and couered it with most fyne gold. <sup>18</sup> Six steppes also, wherwith the going vp was to the throne, and a foote stoole of gold, and two litle armes on either side, and two lions standing by the litle armes, <sup>19</sup> yea and other twelue litle lions standing vpon the steppes on both sides: there was not such a throne in al kingdomes. <sup>20</sup> Al the vessels also of the kinges table were of gold, and the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanus of most pure gold. For siluer in those daies was reputed for nothing. <sup>21</sup> For the kinges shippes went into Tharsis with the seruantes of Hiram, once in three yeares: and they brought from thence gold and siluer, and yuorie, and apes, and peacockes. <sup>22</sup> Salomon therefore was magnified aboue al the kinges of the earth for riches and glorie.
