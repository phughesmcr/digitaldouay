And when vpon a certeine day his sonnes and daughters did eate, and drinke wyne in the house of their eldest brother, <sup>14</sup>there came a messenger to Iob, which sayd: The oxen ploughed, and the she asses fed beside them, <sup>15</sup>and the Sabeans came in violently, & haue taken al things, and haue stroken the seruantes with the sword, and I onlie haue escaped to tel thee. <sup>16</sup>And when he yet spake, an other came, and sayd: The fire of God fel from heauen, and striking the sheepe and the seruantes hath consumed them, and I only haue escaped to tel thee. <sup>17</sup>But whiles he also was yet speaking, there came an other and said: The Chaldees made three troupes, and haue inuaded the camels, and taken them, moreouer the seruantes also they haue strooken with the sword, and I alone am fled to tel thee. <sup>18</sup>He yet spake, and behold an other came in, and said: Thy sonnes and daughters eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, <sup>19</sup>sodenly a vehement winde came violently from the countrie of the desert, and shooke the foure corners of the house, which falling oppressed thy children and they are dead, and I alone haue escaped to tel thee. <sup>20</sup>Then Iob rose vp, and rent his garmentes, and with powled head falling on the ground, adored, <sup>21</sup>and said: Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shal I returne thither: Our Lord gaue, and our Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased our Lord, so is it done: the name of our Lord be blessed. <sup>22</sup>In al these thinges Iob sinned not with his lippes, neither spake he anie foolish thing against God.
