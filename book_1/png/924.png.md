And the inhabitants of Ierusalem made Ochozias his least sonne, king for him: for al the elders, that had bene before him, the rouers of the Arabians had slayne, which inuaded the campe: and Ochozias the sonne of Ioram the king of Iuda reigned. <sup>2</sup> Two and fourtie yeares old was Ocohzias when he began to reigne, and he reigned one yeare in Ierusalem, and the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri. <sup>3</sup> But he also went by the waies of the house of Achab: for his mother forced him to doe impiously. <sup>4</sup> He therfore did euil in the sight of our Lord, as the house of Achab: for they were his counselers after the death of his father, to his destruction. <sup>5</sup> And he walked in their counsels. And he went forth with Ioram the sonne of Achab king of Israel, into battel agaynst Hazael king of Syria, into Ramoth Galaad: and the Syrians wounded Ioram. <sup>6</sup> Who returned to be cured into Iezrael: for he had taken manie woundes in the foresayd battel. Therfore Ochozias the sonne of Ioram king of Iuda, went downe to visit Ioram the sonne of Achab in Iezrael being sicke. <sup>7</sup> For it was the wil of God agaynst Ochozias, that he should come to Ioram: and when he was come he should goe out also against Iehu the sonne of Namsi, whom our Lord anoynted to destroy the house of Achab. <sup>8</sup> When Iehu therfore ouerthrew the house of Achab, he found the princes of Iuda, and the sonne of the brethren of Ochozias, which serued him, and he slewe them. <sup>9</sup> Searching also for Ochozias himself, he tooke him lying hid in Samaria: and being brought vnto him, he killed him, and they buried him: because he was the sonne of Iosaphat, who had sought our Lord in al his hart: neither was there anie more hope that anie should reigne of the stocke of Ochozias. <sup>10</sup> For Athalia his mother, seing that her sonne was dead, arose, and slew al the kinges stocke of the house of Ioram. <sup>11</sup> But Iosabeth the kinges daughter tooke Ioas the sonne of Ochozias, and stole him out of the middes of the kinges sonnes, when they were slayne. and she hid him with his nource in the bedde chamber: and Iosabeth that hid him, was the daughter of king Ioram, the wife of Ioiada the high priest, the sister of Ochozias, and therfore Athalia did not kil him: <sup>12</sup> He therfore was with them in the house of God six yeares, in the which Athalia reigned ouer the Land.

[^1]: To wit when he beganne to reigne alone: for he reigned together with his father at the age of 22. 4. Reg. 8. v. 26. And after his fathers death but one yeare. :: See 4. Reg. 8. v. 18.
