<aside>An other Arke was not made, because that was most holie & most excellent, which Moyses made. Like-wise other holie thinges of the taber-nacle were brought into the Temple with great so-lemnitie.</aside>

children of Israel into Ierusalem, to bring <sup>2</sup> the Arke of the couenant of our Lord from the Citie of Dauid, which is Sion. <sup>3</sup> There came therefore vnto the king al the men of Israel in the solemne day of the seuenth moneth. <sup>4</sup> And when al the ancientes of Israel were come, the Leuites caried the Arke, <sup>5</sup> and brought it in, and al the furniture of the tabernacle. Moreouer the Priestes, with the Leuites did carrie the vessels of the Sanctuarie, which were in the tabernacle. <sup>6</sup> And king Salomon, and al the assemblie of Israel, and al that were gathered before the Arke, immolated rammes, and oxen without anie number: for so great was the multitude of vi-ctimes. <sup>7</sup> And the priestes brought in the Arke of the coue-nant of our Lord into his place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into Sancta sanctorum vnder the winges of the cherubs: <sup>8</sup> so that the cherubs spred their winges ouer the place, wherin the Arke was set, and couered the Arke it selfe with his barres. <sup>9</sup> And the heades of the barres, wherwith the Arke was caried, because they were a litle longer, appea-red before the oracle: but if a man had beene a litle outward, he could not see them. The Arke therefore was there vntil this present day. <sup>10</sup> And there was nothing in the Arke, but the two tables, which Moyses had put in Horeb, when our Lord gaue the law to the children of Israel coming out of Ã†gypt. <sup>11</sup> And the Priestes being gone out of the Sanctuarie (for al the priestes that could be found there, were sanctified, neither as yet at that time were the courses, and the order of the ministeries deuided among them) <sup>12</sup> as wel the Leuites as the singing men, that is, both they which were vnder Asaph, and they which were vnder Heman, and they which were vnder Idithun, their sonnes, & brethren reuested with fine linnen clothes, sounded on cymbals, and psalteries, and harpes, standing at the East side of the Altar, and with them Priestes an hundred twentie, sounding with trumpettes. <sup>13</sup> Therfore al sounding together, both with trumpettes, and voyce, and cymbals, and organes, and with diuerse kind of musical instrumentes, and lifting vp their voice on high: the sound was heard far of, so that when they began to prayse our Lord, and to say: Confesse to our Lord because he is good, because his mercie is for euer: the house of God was filled with a cloud, <sup>14</sup> that the Priestes could not stand and minister for the darkenesse. For the glorie of our Lord had filled the house of God.
