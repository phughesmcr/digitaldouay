# IVDITH.

guard said to him: Who can contemne the people of the He-
brewes, which haue so beautiful wemen, that we should not
worthely fight against them for these? <sup>19</sup> Iudith therfore see-
ing Holofernes sitting in a canopie, which was wouen of
purple, and gold, and emerauld, and pretious stones: <sup>20</sup> and
when she had looked in his face, she adored him, falling
prostrate vpon the ground. And the seruantes of Holofernes
lifted her vp, their lord commanding it.

## CHAP. XI.

*Holofernes demanding Iudith the cause of her coming*: <sup>4</sup>. *she deceiueth him
with a probable narration*.

probably iud-

dith was now
about fourtie
yeares old.

THEN Holofernes said to her: Be of good chere, and
feare not in thy hart: because I haue neuer hurt man,
that would serue Nabuchodonosor the king. <sup>2</sup> And thy peo-
ple, if they had not contemned me, I would neuer haue lifted
vp my speare ouer them. <sup>3</sup> But now tel me, for what cause hast
thou departed from them, and it hath pleased thee to come to
vs? <sup>4</sup> And Iudith said to him: "Take the wordes of thy hand-
mayde, for if thou wilt folow the wordes of thy handmayde,
our Lord wil do with thee a perfect thing. <sup>5</sup> For Nabucho-
donosor the king of the earth liueth, and his power liueth
which is in thee to the chastising of al straying soules: that
not onlie men serue him by thee, but also the beastes of the
field obey him. <sup>6</sup> For the industrie of thy mind is reported to
al nations, and it is declared to al the world, that thou onlie
art good, and mightie in al his kingdom, and thy discipline
is bruted to al prouinces. <sup>7</sup> Neither is that vnknowne, which
Achior spake, neither are we ignorant of that thou hast com-
manded to come vpon him. <sup>8</sup> For it is certaine that our God
is so offended with sinnes, that he hath sent word by his pro-
phetes to the people, that he wil deliuer them for their sin-
nes. <sup>9</sup> And because the children of Israel know they offen-
ded their God, thy dread is vpon them. <sup>10</sup> Moreouer also fa-
mine hath inuaded them, and for drought of water they are
now estemed among the dead. <sup>11</sup> Finally they ordayne this, to
kil their cattel, and to drinke the bloud of them, <sup>12</sup> and the
holie thinges of our Lord their God which God commanded
not to be touched, in corne, wine, and oile, these haue they
purposed to bestow, and they wil consume the thinges which
they ought not to touch with their handes: therfore be-

<aside>Al that Iu-
dith sayth is
true in her
sense: as she
meant it, but
not in the
vnderstanding
of Holofernes
and his soul-
diars, yet was
no lesse ful

sue did in de-
ceiuing the
citezens of
