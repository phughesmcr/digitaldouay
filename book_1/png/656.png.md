His vertues, and praises, to wit, his solemne mourning for Saul and that familie, his devotion, fortitude, pietie, and gratitude are specially touched in the 1. 6. 7. 8. 9. and 10. chapters. His sinnes of adulterie with Bethsabee, of killing her husband Vrias, of pride in numbering his people, with his hartie repentance, and temporal punishment for the same, are written from the 11. chapter to the 21, together with the 24. The 22. and 23. chapters conteyne his thankesgiving to God for benefites received, and prophecie of thinges to come, with a catalogue of valiant men.
