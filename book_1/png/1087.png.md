<sup>3</sup>foolish, and envy slayeth the litle one. † I have seene a foole

with firme roote, and I cursed his beautie by and by. † His <sup>4</sup>
children shalbe made far from salvation, and shal be destroyed
in the gate, and there shalbe none to deliver. † Whose harvest <sup>5</sup>
the hungrie shal eate, & the armed shal take him by violence,
and the thirstie shal drinke his riches. † Nothing in the earth <sup>6</sup>
is done without a cause, and out of the ground sorrow shal
not rise. † Man is borne to labour, and the bird to flight. <sup>7</sup>
† For the which thing I wil beseech our Lord, and toward <sup>8</sup>
God I wil set my speach: † Who doeth great and unsearchable <sup>9</sup>
and mervelous things without number: † Who geveth raine <sup>10</sup>
vpon the face of the earth, and watereth al thinges with waters: † Who setteth the humble on high, and them that are in <sup>11</sup>
heavinesse he comforteth with health: † Who dissipateth the <sup>12</sup>
cogitations of the malignant, that their handes can not accomplish that which they began: † Who apprehendeth the <sup>13</sup>
wise in their subteltie, and dissipateth the counsel of the wicked: † By day they shal incurre darkenesse, and as it were in <sup>14</sup>
the night, so shal they grope at noone daies. † Moreover he <sup>15</sup>
shal save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the
poore from the hand of the violent. † And to the needie there <sup>16</sup>
shal be hope, but iniquitie shal draw together her mouth.
† Blessed is the man that is corrected of God: refuse not ther- <sup>17</sup>
fore the chastising of our Lord: † Because he woundeth, and <sup>18</sup>
cureth: striketh, and his hands shal heale. † In six tribulati- <sup>19</sup>
ons he shal deliver thee, and in the seventh evil shal not
touch thee. † In famine he shal deliver thee from death; and <sup>20</sup>
in battel, from the hand of the sword. † From the scourge of <sup>21</sup>
the tongue thou shalt be hid; & thou shalt not feare calamitie
when it cometh. † In waste and famine thou shalt laugh; and <sup>22</sup>
the beastes of the earth thou shalt not feare. † But with the <sup>23</sup>
stones of the landes thy covenant, and the beastes of the earth
shal be peaceable to thee. † And thou shalt know that thy <sup>24</sup>
tabernacle hath peace, and visiting thy beautie, thou shalt not
sinne. † Thou shalt know also that thy seed shal be manifold, <sup>25</sup>
and thy progenie as the grasse of the earth. † Thou shalt enter <sup>26</sup>
into the grave in abundance, as a heape of wheate is caryed
in his time. † Behold, this is even so, as we have searched out: <sup>27</sup>
which thou having heard revolve in thy mind.

<aside>presented an imaginarie vision from God against Iob, now he proposeth that neither God nor Angel nor other holie person wil patronage his cause,</aside>

<aside>nor iudge of his case as he doth, but that al wil condemne him of impatience, follie, envie, and other sinnes.</aside>

<aside>::This proverb importeth that a man must not thinke to passe his life without travail, but must get his bread with sweat of his browes, or suffer other calamitie.</aside>

<aside>::Gods goodnes delivereth his servants the space of this laborious life,</aside>

<aside>::And most especially in the houre of death.S. Gre. li.6.c.15.</aside>
