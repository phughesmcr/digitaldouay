<sup>22</sup> When they came out of the Land of Egypt. And Salomon stood before the altar of our Lord in the sight of the assemblie of Israel, and extended his handes toward heauen, <sup>23</sup> and sayd: Lord God of Israel, there is no God like to thee in heauen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath: which keepest couenant and mercie with thy seruantes, that walke before thee in al their hart. <sup>24</sup> Which hast kept to thy seruant Dauid my father, the thinges that thou hast spoken to him: by mouth thou didst speake, and with thy handes thou hast accomplished, as this day proueth. <sup>25</sup> Now therfore Lord God of Israel, keepe vnto thy seruant Dauid my father the thinges which thou hast spoken to him, saying: There shal not be taken away of thee a man before me, which sitteth vpon the throne of Israel: yet so if thy children shal keepe their way, that they walke before me as thou hast walked in my sight. <sup>26</sup> And now Lord God of Israel, let thy wordes be established, which thou hast spoken to thy seruant Dauid my father. <sup>27</sup> Is it then to be thought that in deede God dwelleth vpon the earth? For if heauen, and the heauens of heauens can not conteyne thee, how much more this house, which I haue built? <sup>28</sup> But looke toward the prayer of thy seruant, and to his petitions Ã´ Lord my God: heare the hymne and the prayer, which thy seruant prayeth before thee this day: <sup>29</sup> that thy eies be opened vpon this house night and day: vpon the house, wherof thou saydst: My name shal be there: that thou heare the prayer, which thy seruant prayeth in this place to thee. <sup>30</sup> That thou heare the request of thy seruant and of thy people Israel, whatsoeuer they shal pray for in this place, and thou shalt heare in the place of thy habitation in heauen: and when thou hast heard, thou shalt be merciful. <sup>31</sup> If a man shal sinne agaynst his neighbour, and shal haue any oath, wherwith he is held fast bound: and shal come because of the oath before thine altar into thy house, <sup>32</sup> thou shalt heare in heauen: and shalt doe, and iudge thy seruantes, condemning the impious, and rendring his way vpon his head, and iustifying the iust, and rewarding him according to his iustice. <sup>33</sup> If thy people Israel shal flee their enemies (because they wil sinne agaynst thee) and doing penance, and confessing to thy name, shal come, and pray, and beseech thee in this house; <sup>34</sup> heare in heauen, and forgeue the sinne of thy people Israel, and thou shalt reduce them vnto the land, which thou gauest to their fathers.

<aside>Salomon knew wel Gods conditi-onal promise, but perseuered not in keeping his commaund-ments, and therfore a great part of the kingdom was taken from his children, yet the right of the king-dom of Iuda remayned to his seede euen to Christ our Sauiour.</aside>
