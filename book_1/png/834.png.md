Ioachin, Sedecias.

<sup>6</sup>And Ioakim slept with his fathers: and Ioachin his sonne reigned for him. <sup>7</sup>And the king of Ægypt added no more to come out of his countrie: for the king of Babylon had taken al that had beene the kinges of Ægypt, from the riuer of Ægypt, vnto the riuer Euphrates. <sup>8</sup>Eightene yeares old was Ioachin when he began to reigne, and he reig- ned three monethes in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta the daughter of Elnathan of Ierusalem. <sup>9</sup>And he did euil before our Lord, according to al thinges which his father had done. <sup>10</sup>At that time came vp the seruantes of Na- buchodonosor the king of Babylon into Ierusalem, and the citie was compassed with fortes. <sup>11</sup>And Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came to the citie with his seruantes to assault it. <sup>12</sup>And Ioachin the king of Iuda went forth to the king of Babylon, he and his mother, and his seruantes, and his nobles, and his eunuches: and the king of Babylon recei- ued him the eight yeare of his reigne. <sup>13</sup>And he brought forth from thence al the treasures of the house of our Lord, and the treasures of the kinges house: and he cut in peces al the golden vessel, which Salomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of our Lord, according to the word of our Lord. <sup>14</sup>And he transported al Ierusalem, and al the princes, and al the strong men of the armie, ten thousand into captiuitie: and euerie artificer and incloser: and nothing was left, sauing the poore sorte of the people of the land. <sup>15</sup>He transported also Ioachin into Babylon, and the kinges mother, and the kinges wiues, and his eunuches: and the iudges of the land he led into captiuitie from Ierusalem into Babylon. <sup>16</sup>And al the strong men, seuen thousand, and the artificers, and inclosers a thousand, al valiant men and warriers: and the king of Baby- lon led them captiues into Babylon. <sup>17</sup>And he appointed Matthanias his vncle for him: and called his name Sedecias. <sup>18</sup>One and twentie yeares old was Sedecias when he began to reigne, and he reigned eleuen yeares in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Ieremie of Lobna. <sup>19</sup>And he did euil before our Lord, according to al thinges which Ioakim had done. <sup>20</sup>For our Lord was wrath against Ierusalem and against Iuda, til he cast them away from his face: and Sedecias reuolted from the king of Babylon.
