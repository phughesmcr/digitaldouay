# Deuteronomie

<sup>50</sup> Which going vp vnto thou shalt be ioyned to thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was layd to his people: <sup>51</sup> because you did preuaricate against me in the middes of the children of Israel at the Waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctifie me among the children of Israel. <sup>52</sup> Ouer against shalt thou see the Land, and shalt not enter into it, which I wil geue to the children of Israel.

## ANNOTATIONS.

### CHAP. XXXII.

<aside>Calvin contradicteth the holie Scripture.</aside>

18. *Forgotten our Lord.*] Caluin (li. 1. Instit. c. 11. parag. 9.) contending that it is idolatrie, to worship Christ in his picture, saieth the idolatrie committed about the molten calfe (*Exod. 32.*) consisted in worshipping the true God in that image of a calfe: affirming that *the Iewes were not so brutish, as not to remember, that it was God which had brought them out of the Land of Ã†gypt*. Quite contrarie to this text, which saieth: God that begate thee thou hast forsaken, and hast forgotten our Lord thy creator. Caluin therfore was either ignorant or forgetful, that the Holie Ghost here chargeth them, to haue forsaken and forgotten God the Creator; or els (which is worse) knowing and remembring it, he was most impudent in auouching the contrarie.

<aside>Alwayes some good in the Church of the old Testament.</aside>

43. *Praise his people.*] In the people of the Iewes were alwayes some good, & worthie of praise, that serued God; and sometimes suffered persecution for iustice, whose bloud God promised here to reuenge, and for their sakes to be merciful to others. Al which we see was performed, in that God reduced them from captiuitie, and conserued the Messias in their countrie til Christ time, for so he was *propitious to the land of his people*.

## CHAP. XXXIII.

*Moyses blessing the tribes of Israel (Simeon omitted) prophecyeth particularly of euerie one. 26. Againe exhorteth them, that as God hath chosen them his peculiar people, so they loue and honour him their onlie God.*

<sup>1</sup> THIS is[^1] the blessing, wherwith Moyses the man of God blessed the children of Israel, before his death.

<sup>2</sup> And he said: Our Lord "came from Sinai, and from Seir is he risen to vs: he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousandes of Sainctes. In his right hand a fyrie law.

<sup>3</sup> He hath loued the peoples, al the sainctes are in his hand: and they that approch to his feete, shal receiue of his doctrine.

<sup>4</sup> Moyses commanded vs a law, the inheritance of the multitude of Iacob.

[^1]: The ancient fathers expound these blessinges rather of the Church of Christ, then of the Iewes Synagogue. *S. Aug. q. 56. Theod. q. 44. in Deut.*
