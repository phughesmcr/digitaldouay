<aside>A pleasing hill in the forest.</aside>

entered into the borders thereof, & the forrest of the carmel thereof haue I cut downe. And I haue drunke strange waters, and haue dried vp with the steppes of my feete al the waters inclosed. <sup>25</sup> Why, hast thou not heard what I haue done from the begining? From ancient daies I haue made that thing, and now I haue brought it to effect: and fensed cities shal be into ruine of litle hilles bickering together. <sup>26</sup> And they that sitte in them, weake of hand, they haue trembled and are confounded, they became as the grasse of the field, and the greene herbe of the roofes of houses, which withered before it came to ripenesse. <sup>27</sup> Thy habitation, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy waye I haue knowen before, & thy furie against me. <sup>28</sup> Thou hast bene madde against me, & thy pride hath ascended into myn eares: I therfore wil put a ring in thy nostrils, and a bitte in thy lippes, and wil bring thee back into the way, by the which thou camest. <sup>29</sup> And to thee Ezechias this shal be a signe: Eate this yeare what thou shalt finde: & in the second yeare, the things that growe of themselues: moreouer in the third yeare sawe ye and reape: plant ye vineyardes, and eate the fruite of them. <sup>30</sup> And whatsoeuer shal be leaft of the house of Iuda, shal take roote downeward, and beare fruit vpward. <sup>31</sup> For out of Ierusalem there shal remantes goe forth, and that which is to be saued from the mounte of Sion: the zeale of the Lord of hostes shal doe this. <sup>32</sup> Wherfore thus sayth our Lord of the king of the Assyrians: He shal not enter into this citie, nor shoote arrowe into it, neither shal shield occupie it, nor munition compasse it. <sup>33</sup> By the way, that he came, he shal returne: and into this citie he shal not enter, sayth our Lord. <sup>34</sup> And I wil protect this citie, and wil saue it for my self, and for Dauid my seruant. <sup>35</sup> It came to passe therfore in that night, an Angel of our Lord came, and stroke in the campe of the Assyrians an hundred eightie fiue thousand. And when he was risen early, he saw al the bodies of the dead; <sup>36</sup> and Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians departing went away, and taried in Niniue. <sup>37</sup> And when he adored in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech and Sarafar his sonnes stroke him with the sword, and they fled into the land of the Armenians, and Asarhaddon his sonne reigned for him.
