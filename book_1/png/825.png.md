# OF KINGES. CHAP. XX.

Ezechias being sick is told by Isaie that he shal die: but praying to God obtayneth fiftene yeares longer life, 8. and in confirmation therof receiueth a signe in Achaz dial, returning back tenne lines. 12. To the Assyrians bringing him presents, he sheweth al his treasures. 16. which Isaie reprehending prophecieth the captiuitie of Iuda. 20. Ezechias dieth, and his sonne Manasses reigneth.

<sup>1</sup> IN those dayes Ezechias was sick euen to death: and Isaie the sonne of Amos the prophete, came and sayd to him: Thus sayth our Lord God: Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and shalt not liue. <sup>2</sup> Who turned his face to the wal, and prayed our Lord, saying: <sup>3</sup> I beseech thee Lord, remember I pray thee how I haue walked before thee in truth, and in a perfect hart, and haue done that which is liked before thee. Ezechias therfore wept with great weeping. <sup>4</sup> And before Isaie was gone out of the middes of the court, the word of our Lord came to him, saying: <sup>5</sup> Returne, and tel Ezechias the prince of my people: Thus sayth our Lord the God of Dauid thy father: I haue heard thy prayer, and seene thy teares: and behold I haue healed thee, the third day thou shalt goe vp to the temple of the Lord. <sup>6</sup> And I wil adde to thy daies fiftene yeares: yea & out of the hand of the king of Assyrians I wil deliuer thee, and this citie, & I wil protect this citie for my sake, and for Dauid my seruant. <sup>7</sup> And Isaie said: Fetch me a bunch of figges. Which when they had brought, and had layd it vpon his sore, he was cured. <sup>8</sup> And Ezechias had sayd to Isaie: What signe shal there be, that our Lord wil heale me, and that I shal goe vp the third day to the temple of our Lord? <sup>9</sup> To whom Isaie sayd: This shal be the signe from our Lord, that our lord wil doe the word, which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow goe forward ten lines, or that it goe backe soe many degrees. <sup>10</sup> And Ezechias sayd: It is an easie matter for the shadow to goe forward ten lines, neither wil I that this be done, but that it returne back ten degrees. <sup>11</sup> Isaie therfore the prophet inuocated our Lord, and brought backe the shadow by[^1] the lines, by the which it was now gone downe in the dial of Achaz, backward ten degrees. <sup>12</sup> In that time Berodach Baladan, the sonne of Baladan, the king of the Babilonians sent letters and giftes to Ezechias: for he had heard that Ezechias had bene sicke.
