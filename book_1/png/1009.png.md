# ANNOTATIONS.

Concerning the bookes of TOBIAS, IVDITH, WISDOM, ECCLESIASTICVS, and MACHABEES.

PROTESTANTES and other Sectaries of this time denie these bookes to be diuine Scripture, because they are not in the Iewes Canon, nor were accepted for canonical in the primitiue Church. But in deede the chiefe cause is, for that some thinges in these bookes, are so manifest against their opinions, that they haue no other answere, but to reiect their authoritie. An old shift noted and refuted by S. Augustin touching the Booke of Wisdome, which some refused, pretending that it was not canonical, but in deede because it conuinced their errors. For otherwise who seeth not, that the Canon of the Church of Christ is of more authoritie with al true Christians, then the Canon of the Iewes? And that the Church of Christ numbereth these Bookes amongst others of diuine and infallible authoritie, is euident by the testimonies and definition, not only of later general Councels; of Trent, Sess. 4. and Florence *in decreto vnionis Armenorum*, of Pope Innocentius, *Epist. ad Exuperium*, and Gelasius, *Decreto de libris sacris*; but also the Councel of Carthage *An. Dom*. 419. S. Augustin *lib* 2. *Doct. Christ cap*. 8. Isidorus *lib*. 6. *Etymol. cap*. 1. Cassiodorus *lib*. 1. *Diuinarum lectionum*, Rabanus, *lib* 2 *de institutione Clericorum*, and others testifie the same, as we shal further note seuerally of euerie booke, in their particular places. And for so much as our aduersaries acknowledge these Bookes to be Holie, and worthie to be read in the Church, but not sufficient to proue and confirme pointes of faith: the studious reader may consider that the Councel of Carthage calleth them Canonical, and Diuine, which sheweth that they are of infallible authoritie. For a Canon is an assured rule and warrant of direction, whereby (sayth S. Augustin *lib*. 11. *contra Faustum, cap*. 5. & *lib*. 2. *contra Cresconium, cap*. 32) the infirmitie of our defect in knowledge is guided, and by which rule other bookes are likewise knowne to be Gods word. His reason is, because we haue no other assurance that the bookes of Moyses, the foure Gospels, and other bookes are the true word of God, but by the Canon of the Church. Wherevpon the same great Doctor vttered that famous saying: that he would not beleeue the Gospel, except the authoritie of the Catholique Church moued him therevnto. *contra Epist. fundamenti, ca*. 5.

True it is that some Catholique Doctors doubted whether these bookes were Canonical or no, because the Church had not then declared that they were; but since the Churches declaration no Catholique doubteth. So S. Ierom testifieth, that the Booke of Iudith (among the rest) semed to him not canonical, til the Councel of Nice declared it to be. Likewise the Epistle to the Hebrewes, the Epistle of S. Iames, the second of S. Peter, the second and third of S. Iohn, S. Iudes Epistle, and the Apocalypse were sometimes doubted of, yet were afterwardes declared to be Canonical. And most Protestantes, namely English admit them al, as the assured word of God, though they were not alwaies so reputed by al, but as S. Ierome affirmeth of S. Iames Epistle, *paulatim tempore precedente meruit authoritatem*. By litle and litle in processe of time me-
