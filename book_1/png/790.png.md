know that there is a prophet in Israel. <sup>9</sup> Naaman therefore came with horses and chariotes, and stood at the doore of the house of Eliseus: <sup>10</sup> and Eliseus sent a messenger to him, saying: Goe and be washed seuen times in Iordan, and thy flesh shal receiue health, and thou shalt be cleane. <sup>11</sup> Naaman being angrie departed, saying: I thought he would come out to me, and standing would inuocate the name of the Lord his God, and touch with his hand the place of the leprosie, and cure me. <sup>12</sup> What are not Abana, and Pharphar the riuers of Damascus, better then al the waters of Israel, that I may be washed in them, and be made cleane? Therfore when he had turned him self, and went away with indignation, <sup>13</sup> his seruantes came vnto him, & spake to him: Father, & if the prophet had sayd a great thing to thee, certes, thou shouldest haue done it: how much more wheras now he sayd vnto thee: Be washed, and thou shalt be cleane? <sup>14</sup> He went downe, & washed in Iordan seuen times according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, as the flesh of a litle childe, & he was made cleane. <sup>15</sup> And returning to the man of God with al his trayne, he came, and stood before him, & sayd: In very deede I know that there is no other God in al the earth, but only in Israel. I beseech the therefore to take a benediction of thy seruant. <sup>16</sup> But he answered: Our Lord liueth, before whom I stand, I wil not take it. And when he would haue forced him, he did in no wise agree. <sup>17</sup> And Naaman sayd: As thou wilt, but I beseech thee: graunt vnto me thy seruant, that I may take of :: the earth the burden of two mules: for thy seruant wil no more make holocaust, or victimes to strange goddes, but to the Lord. <sup>18</sup> But this onlie is it, for which thou shalt beseech the Lord for thy seruant, when my maister shal goe into the temple of Remmon, to adore: and he leaning vpon my hand, if I shal adore in the temple of Remmon, he adoring in the same place, that the Lord pardon me thy seruant for this thing. <sup>19</sup> Who sayd to him: "Goe in peace. He therefore went from him in the spring time of the earth. <sup>20</sup> And :: Giezi the seruant of the man of God sayd: My maister hath spared Naaman this Syrian, that he tooke not of him the thinges which he brought: Our Lord liueth, I wil runne after him, and wil take some thing of him. <sup>21</sup> And Giezi folowed at the backe of Naaman: whom when he saw running toward him, he lept downe from his chariote to meete him, and said: Are al thinges wel? <sup>22</sup> And he sayd:

<aside>:: In respect of Gods special clensing and sanctifying the land of Chanaan, by his true religion, Naaman rightly estemed that earth fitter for an altar then the earth of his owne countrie.</aside>

<aside>:: Giezi presumed falsly to professe the false Apostle, and al those that abuse the name of Christ.</aside>
