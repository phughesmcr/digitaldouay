# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF TOBIE.

<aside>Other testimonies, that this Booke is canonical.</aside>

BESIDES the testimonies of Councels and Fathers before mentioned, S. Cyprian, de Oratione Dominica alleaging this booke (cap. 11.) saith: Diuine Scripture instructeth vs, that prayer is good with fasting and almes. S. Ambrose (li. de Tobia, c. 1.) calleth this booke by the common name of Scripture, saying: he wil briefly gather the vertues of Tobie, which the Scripture in historical maner layeth forth at large. Where he also calleth this historie Prophetical, and Tobie a Prophet. And lib. 3. offic. cap. 14. alleageth this booke as he doth other holie Scriptures, to proue that the vertues of Gods seruants farre excel the Moral Philosophers. S. Chrysostom ho. 15. ad Heb. alleageth Tobias, as Scripture denouncing curse to contemners. S. Augustin made a special sermon of Tobias, as he did of Iob, which is the 226. sermon de tempore S. Gregorie parte. 3. pastor. cur√¶ admon. 21. alleageth it as holie Scripture. And Vene able Beda expoundeth this whole booke mystically, as he doth other holy scriptures S. Ierom translated it out of the Chaldee language, wh rein it was written, iudging it more mete to displease the Pharisaical Iewes, who reiect it, then not to satisfie the wil of holie Bishops, vrging to haue it. Epist. ad Chromat. & Heliodorum. to. 3.

<aside>The contents.</aside>

The author is vncertaine: but S. Athanasius (in Synopsi) reporteth the contentes at large. And S. Augustin (li. 2. quest. ex vtroque testamento q. 119.) deliuereth both the contentes, and cause of writing it, briefly thus: The ser-uant of God, holie Tobias is geuen to vs after the law, for an ex-ample; that we might know how to practise the thinges, which we reade. And if tentations come vpon vs, not to depart from the feare of God, nor expect helpe from anie other then from him.

<aside>Diuided into three partes.</aside>

It may be diuided into three partes. The first sheweth the vertues and sinceritie of life of old Tobias. The eight folowing relate the iourney, and affayres of yong Tobias, accompanied and directed by the Angel Raphael. In the two last chapters, they praise God. And old Tobias prophecieth better state of the commonwealth.
