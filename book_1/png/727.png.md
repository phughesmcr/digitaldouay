Solomon:

his sonne king Solomon builded the famous Temple in Hierusalem. 3. Reg. 6. which succeding in place of the Tabernacle, ech of them (one after the other) was the only ordinarie place of Sacrifice. The law commanding (Leuit. 17.) If anie man of the house of Israel, kil an oxe, or a sheepe, or a goate (towit for sacrifice, as S. Augustin, and other fathers expound it) and offer it not at the dore of the tabernacle, (afterwards at the dore of the Temple,) he shal be guiltie of bloud, as if he had shed bloud, and so shal he perish out of the middes of his people. Neuertheles vpon occasion, and by special reuelation sacrifice was lawfully offered in other places. For so in the time of the tabernacle, Samuel the prophet, offered Sacrifice in Masphath. 1. Reg. 7. And the prophet Elias offered Sacrifice without the Temple, when he conuinced the false prophetes of Baal. 3. Reg. 18. Whose fact (as S. Augustin noteth) the miracle sufficiently shewed to be donne by Gods dispensation.

And as peculiar places were dedicated, so also special times were sanctified, and diuers feastes, and festiuities partly ordained before (as the Sabbath. Gen. 2. and Pasch Exod. 12.) were confirmed by the Law (Exod. 20. 23.) and others likewise instituted (Exod. 23. Leuit. 23. Num. 28. 29. and Deut. 16.) with proper sacrifices for euerie sort. First and most general was the dailie sacrifice of a lambe euerie day twise, at morning and euening (Exod. 29.) which was not properly a feast, but a sacred perpetual office in the tabernacle, and after in the temple. Al the rest were festiual dayes, in which it was not lawful ordinarily to do seruile worke. The first of these was the Sabbath, that is the seuenth and last day of euerie weke, which is our saturday: kept stil solemnly by the Iewes, euen at this time, in al places where they dwel; but not by Christians, because the old Law is abrogated; and we kepe the next day, which is Sunday, holie, by institution and tradition of the Church. The second, Neomenia, or new moones, in which day they alwaies beganne the moneth; and twelue such monethes made a yeare, by the course of the moone; for by the course of the sunne, the yeare conteineth eleuen dayes more, which in three yeares make about a moneth. And so euerie third yeare, and sometimes the second (for it happened seuen times in nintene yeares) had thirtene monethes: and was called Annus embolismalis, being increased by meanes of those eleuen dayes. The third feast was Pasch, or Phase, first instituted at the parting of the children of Israel out of Ã†gypt, in the ful moone of the first moneth in the spring, in which the Paschal lambe was eaten, as is prescribed; Exod. 12. The fourth feast was Pentecost, or first fruites, the fiftith day after Pasch, when Moyses receiued the Law in mount Synai. The fifth, the feast of Trumpets, the first day of the seuenth moneth, in grateful memorie that a ramme sticking by the hornes, was offered in sacrifice by Abraham in place of Isaac. The sixth was the feast of Expiation, the tenth
