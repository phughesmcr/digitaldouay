a tempest thou makest a calme, and after teares and weeping thou powest in ioyfulnesse. <sup>24</sup> Be thy name God of Israel blessed for euer. <sup>25</sup> At that time the prayers of both were heard in the sight of the glorie of the high God: <sup>26</sup> and the holie Angel of our Lord Raphael was sent, to cure them both, whose prayers at one time were recited in the sight of our Lord.

CHAP. IIII.

*Tobias thinking he shal dye, geueth his sonne godlie admonitions. 7. especially exhorteth him to geue almes diligently. 13. to flee al fornication, pride, and fraude. 21. And telleth him of mony lent to a freind.*

<sup>1</sup> THERFORE when Tobias thought his prayer to be heard that he might haue died, he called to him Tobias his sonne, <sup>2</sup> and sayd to him: Heare my sonne the wordes of my mouth, & lay them as a foundation in thy hart. <sup>3</sup> When God shal take my soule, burie my bodie: and thou shalt doe honour to thy mother al the dayes of her life: <sup>4</sup> for thou must be mindful what perils, and how great she suffered for thee in her wombe. <sup>5</sup> And when she also shal haue accomplished the time of her life, burie her beside me. <sup>6</sup> And al the dayes of thy life haue God in thy mind: and beware thou consent not to sinne at anie time, and pretermitte the preceptes of our Lord God. <sup>7</sup> Of thy substance geue almes, and turne not away thy face from anie poore person: for so it shal come to passe that neither the face of our Lord shal be turned from thee. <sup>8</sup> As thou shalt be able, so be merciful. <sup>9</sup> If thou haue much, geue abundantly: if thou haue litle, studie to impert also a litle willingly. <sup>10</sup> For thou dost treasure vp to thy self a good reward in the day of necessitie. <sup>11</sup> because almes deliuereth from al sinne, and from death, & wil not suffer the soule to goe into darkenesse. <sup>12</sup> Great confidence before God most high shal almes be to al them that doe it. <sup>13</sup> Take heed to thy self my sonne of al fornication, & beside thy wife neuer abide to know crime. <sup>14</sup> Neuer permitte pryde to rule in thy word: for in it al perdition tooke his beginning. <sup>15</sup> Whosoeuer hath wrought anie thing for thee, pay him his hyre immediatly, and let not the hyre of thy hyred seruant remayne with thee at al. <sup>16</sup> That which thou hatest to be done to thee by an other, see thou doe it not to an other at anie time. <sup>17</sup> Eate thy bread with the hungrie & needie, and of thy garmentes couer the naked. <sup>18</sup> Set thy bread, and thy wine vpon the burial of a iust man,
