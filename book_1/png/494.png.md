CHAP. III.

[^1] Command the priestes.] Because Iosue commanded the priestes to take the arke, and stand with it in Iordan; for that also (*chap. 1.*) he ministred, or appointed others to minister, the Sacrament of Circumcision; Likewise (*chap. 8.*) blessed the people; and (*chap. 24.) renewed Gods couenant with them: English Protestantes inferre, that he was chief superior in spiritual causes; and therfore lay princes are supreme heades, & gouernors of the Church immediatly vnder God. But none of these actions, nor al put together do proue their purpose. For notwithstanding he very lawfully did these, and other like thinges, yet he
