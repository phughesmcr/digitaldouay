ESTHER.

<sup>3</sup> Father and mother being dead, Mardocheus adopted her for his daughter. And when the kings commandment was bruited abrode, and according to his commandement many fayre virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maydens was delivered to him, that she might be kept in the number of the women. <sup>9</sup> Who pleased him, and found grace in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch, that he should hasten the womens ornamentes, and should deliver her, her partes, & seven the most beautiful maydens of the kings house, and should adorne and decke both her and her wayting maydes. <sup>10</sup> Who would nottel him her people and countrie. For Mardocheus had commanded her, that of this thing she should altogether keepe silence: <sup>11</sup> who walked daily before the entrance of the house, wherin the chosen virgins were kept, taking care of Esthers welfare, and desirous to know what should chance vnto her. <sup>12</sup> And when the time of everie virgin in order was come, that they should goe in to the king, al things accomplished that perteyned to womens ornamentes, it was the twelfth moneth: yet so, that for six monethes they were anoynted with oyle of myrtle, and other six monethes they vsed certayne payntings and sweete spices. <sup>13</sup> And going in to the king, what soever they asked that perteyned to adorning they received: and being trimmed, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the kings chamber. <sup>14</sup> And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was brought to the second house, that was vnder the hand of Susagazus the eunuch, who was chiefe over the kings concubines: neither had she power to returne any more to the king, vnlesse the king had willed, and had commanded her to come by name. <sup>15</sup> And the time by order coming about, the day was at hand, that Esther the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardocheus, whom he had adopted for his daughter, should goe in to the king. Who sought not womens ornamentes, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins would, those things he gave her to her adorning. For she was exceeding fayre, and of incredible beautie, she semed to al mens eies gratious and amiable. <sup>16</sup> She therfore was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth moneth, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh yeare of his reigne.

[^1]: Deut. 7. v. 1. Israelites are forbid to marie with Gentiles: yet when there was no danger to be perverted, and great hope of good, Esther by Mardocheus counsel consented to marie king Assuerus, though otherwise she desired not the companie of the incircumcised, and of strange religion.
