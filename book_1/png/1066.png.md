And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: it were a tolerable evil, and mourning I would hold my peace: but now it is our enemie, whose crueltie redoundeth vpon the king. <sup>5</sup> And king Assuerus answering, said: Who is this, and of what might, that he dare doe these things? <sup>6</sup> And Esther said: It is this Aman our aduersarie and most wicked enemie. Which he hearing :: forthwith was astonished, not enduring to beare the countenance of the king and of the queene. <sup>7</sup> But the king being wrath rose vp, and from the place of the banket went into the garden set with trees.

Neither was the word yet passed from the kings mouth, and immediately they couered his face. <sup>9</sup> And Harbona, :: one of the eunuches which stood wayting on the king, sayd: Behold the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardocheus, that spake for the king, standeth in Amans house, hauing in height fiftie cubites. To whom the king said: Hang him vpon it. <sup>10</sup> Aman therfore was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardocheus: and the kings wrath ceased.
