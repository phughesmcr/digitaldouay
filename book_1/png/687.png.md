The king therefore came, and al the people with him wearie, and they were refreshed there. <sup>15</sup> But Absalom and al his people entered into Ierusalem, yea and Achitophel with him. <sup>16</sup> And when Chusai the Arachite Dauids frend was come to Absalom, he said to him: God saue thee ô king, God saue thee ô king. <sup>17</sup> To whom Absalom, is this, quoth he, thy kindenes toward thy frend? why wentest thou not with thy frend? <sup>18</sup> And Chusai answered Absalom: Not so: because I wil be his, whom our Lord hath chosen, and al this people, and al Israel, and with him wil tarie. <sup>19</sup> Yea that I may adde this also, whom shal I serue? not the kinges sonne? as I haue serued thy father, so wil I serue thee also. <sup>20</sup> And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we ought to doe. <sup>21</sup> And Achitophel said to Absalom: Goe in to the concubines of thy father, which he hath left to keepe the house: that when al Israel shal heare that thou hast defiled thy father, their handes may be strengthened with thee. <sup>22</sup> They pitched therefore a tent for Absalom in the house toppe, and he went in to his fathers concubines before al Israel. <sup>23</sup> And the counsel of Achitophel, which he gaue in those dayes, as if a man should consult God: so was al the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with Dauid, and when he was with Absalom.
