And Dauid also was girded with his sworde: and there folowed Dauid about foure hundred men: moreouer two hundred remayned at the baggage. <sup>14</sup> But to Abigail the wife of Nabal one of their seruantes told, saying: Behold Dauid hath sent messengers from the desert, to blesse our maister: & he disdayned them: <sup>15</sup> these men were good ynough to vs, and not trublesome: neither did euer any thing perish al the time, that we haue couuersed with them in the desert: <sup>16</sup> they were in steed of a wal to vs both in the day and in the night, al the dayes that we fed the flockes with them. <sup>17</sup> Wherefore consider, & thinke what thou hast to doe, for malice is accomplished against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is the sonne of Belial, so that no man can speake to him. <sup>18</sup> Abigail therefore made hast, and tooke two hundred loaues, and two bottels of wine, and fiue muttons ready drest, and fiue measures of polent, and a hundred branches of raysens, and two hundred masses of drie figges, and laid them vpon asses: <sup>19</sup> and said to her seruantes: Goe before me: loe, I wil folow you at your backe: but she told not her husband Nabal. <sup>20</sup> When she therefore had gotten vpon an asse, and came downe to the foote of the mountaine, Dauid and his men came downe meeting her, whom she also mette. <sup>21</sup> And Dauid said: In vaine verely haue I preserued al thinges that were this mans in the desert, and there perished nothing of al that perteined to him: and he hath rendred me euil for good. <sup>22</sup> These thinges doe God to the enemies of Dauid, and these thinges adde he, if I shal leaue of al thinges that perteine to him vntil morning, any thing pissing against the wal. <sup>23</sup> And when Abigail had seene Dauid, she made hast, and light from her asse, and fel downe before Dauid vpon her face, and adored vpon the earth, <sup>24</sup> and fel at his feete, and sayd: In me my lord be this iniquitie: let thy handmayde speake I beseech thee in thine eares: and heare the wordes of thy seruant. <sup>25</sup> Let not my lord the king I pray thee, set his hart vpon this naughtie man Nabal: because according to his name, he is a foole, and follie is with him: but I thy handmaide sawe not thy seruantes my lord, whom thou didst send. <sup>26</sup> Now therefore my lord, our Lord liueth, and thy soule liueth, who hath stayed thee that thou shouldest
