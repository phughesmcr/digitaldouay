<sup>13</sup> of our Lord his God, neither did he reverence the face of Ieremie the prophet speaking to him from the mouth of our Lord. <sup>14</sup> He revolted also from king Nabuchodonosor, who had adjured him by God: & he hardened his necke & his hart, that he would not returne to our Lord the God of Israel. <sup>15</sup> Yea & al the chiefe of the Priestes, and the people transgressed unlawfully according to al the abominations of the Gentiles: and they polluted the house of our Lord, which he had sanctified to him in Ierusalem. <sup>16</sup> And our Lord the God of their fathers sent to them, by the hand of his messengers, rysing by night, and daily admonishing them: for that he spared his people and his habitation. <sup>17</sup> But they mocked the messengers of God, and litle estemed his wordes, and scorned the prophetes, until the furie of our Lord ascended upon his people, and there was no amendment. <sup>18</sup> For he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, and slew their yong men with the sword in the house of his sanctuarie, he pitied not yong man, and virgin, and old man, no neither him that stouped for age, but he delivered al into his handes. <sup>19</sup> And al the vessels of the house of our Lord, as wel greater as lesser, and the treasures of the temple, and of the king, and the princes he transported into Babylon. <sup>20</sup> The enemies set fyre on the house of God, and destroyed the wal of Ierusalem, al the towres they burnt, and what soever was pretious, they destroyed. <sup>21</sup> If anie man escaped the sword, being led into Babylon he served the king and his sonnes, til the king of the Persians reigned. <sup>22</sup> That the word of our Lord by the mouth of Ieremie might be accomplished, and the land might celebrate their Sabbathes: for al the daies of the desolation she kept a Sabbath, til the seventie yeares were expyred.

<sup>23</sup> But in the first yeare of Cyrus king of Persians, to fulfil the word of our Lord, which he had spoken by the mouth of Ieremie, our Lord raysed up the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians: who commanded to be proclaymed in al his kingdom, yea by writing, saying: <sup>24</sup> Thus sayth Cyrus king of the Persians: Al kingdomes of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven geuen me, and he hath commanded me that I should build him a house in Ierusalem, which is in Iewrie: who of you is there in al his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him goe up.
