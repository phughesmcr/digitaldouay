through Iordan. IOSVE. 475

had a spiritual superior in earth, which was Eleazar the high priest. For Moyses being extraordinarie superior of al, both in spiritual and temporal causes, the ordinarie priesthood, and spiritual supernature was established in Aaron and his sonnes, as appeareth *Leuit. 8. Num. 10.* and other places: and the temporal <sup>4</sup> gouernment after Moyses was geuen to Iosue, succeeding to him (*Num. 27.*) <sup>5,6</sup> not in al, but in part of his glorie (or authoritie): his whole honour (or power) being deuided betwene the high Priest, and the temporal Prince, as learned Theodorette (*q. 48 in Num.*) noteth vpon these sacred text; expressly distinguishing their offices (*v. 21.*) that *Eleazar the priest should consult our Lord for him* (and so receiue answer in doctrine and veritie, *Exod. 28. Leuit. 8.*) and that *Iosue should goe out and goe in, and al the children of Israel with him* (that is, lead and gouerne the people) *at Eleazars word*. Where it is manifest that Iosue was not set ouer Eleazar, but Eleazar ouer him. That therefore which Iosue did in spiritual affaires, was in subordination to the high priest; by whose direction, approbation, or ratihabilition, he commanded some of the priestes to carie the arke, and whilest the armie and people passed ouer: also gaue order that al should be <sup>Chap. 5.</sup> circumcised; blessed the people; read the law; and after goodlie exhortations, <sup>8.</sup> renewed the couenant betwen God and them; al in way of execution of Gods <sup>22.</sup> wil & commandementes, not by anie pretended iurisdiction in spiritual thinges. <sup>24.</sup> In like sorte manie other good temporal Princes, as wel in the old as the new Testament, haue disposed and executed diuers thinges pertening to Gods seruice: their office requiring that they should set forward, maintaine and defend true faith and religion. Especially Christian Princes, of whom Esai prophecied (*chap. 49.*) that *Kinges should be foster fathers, and Queenes nurses of the Church*. Conformably whereto S. Augustin teacheth (*li. 3. c. 51. contra Creston*) that Kinges, in that they are Kinges, serue God by commanding good thinges, and forbidding euel, not only pertening to humaine societie, but also belonging to Gods religion. To this effect Constantine the great did manie religious actes: yea euen those thinges which our aduersaries wrest to their owne sense, shew euidently his due submission to his spiritual pastors. As when vrged by the Donatistes recourse importunitie, and being desirous (as S. Augustin testifieth, *Epist. 166.*) to bridle so great impudencie, he heard and iudged Bishop Cecilians cause, after other Bishops sentence for him against the heretikes; where he both gaue indgement agreable to the Bishops, and yet crauing pardon, excused himselfe for this fact. Which had not neded, if he had bene the ordinarie or competent iudge. Optatus also writeth (*li. 1. cont. Parmen.*) that the same Emperour Constantine exclaimed against the appellantes in these wordes: *O rabida furoris audacia! sicut in causis Gentilium fieri solet, appellationem interposuerunt*. O outragious boldnes of furie! like as in causes of Gentiles is wont, they haue interposed an appeal. The like good offices did Iustinian, and Charles the great, and manie other Christian Emperours and Kinges; for which they are much renowmed in the whole Church; and some haue benne honoured for their religious zele, with glorious titles geuen to them and their successors. To the Kinges of Spaine, from the time of Alfonsus King of Castil, about eight hundred yeares agone, for expelling the Arians, was geuen the title of *Catholique* as Michael Ritius a Neapolitan writeth. To the French Kinges the title of *most Christian*, from the time of Philip the Emperour, about 400. yeares since, for expelling the Albigenses, as recordeth Nicholaus Gillius. To our King <sup>An. 1521.</sup> Henrie the eight of England, for his booke (the Sacramentes against Luther) Pope Leo the tenth gaue the title: *Defender of the faith*.
