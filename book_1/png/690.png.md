under the hand of Abisai the sonne of Seruia the brother of
Ioab, and the third part vnder the hand of Ethai, who was of
Geth: and the king said to the people: I also wil goe forth
with you. <sup>3</sup> And the people answered: Thou shalt not goe
forth: for whether we shal flee, it wil be no great importance
to them of vs: or whether the halfe part of vs shal fal, they
wil not greatly care: because thou alone art accounted for ten
thousandes: it is better therefore that thou be in the citie to
ayde vs. <sup>4</sup> To whom the king said: What seemeth good to
you, that wil I doe. The king therefore stoode beside the gate:
and al the people went forth by their troupes, by hundredes
and by thousandes. <sup>5</sup> And the King commanded Ioab, and
Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Saue me the child Absalom. And
al the people heard the King commanding al the princes for
Absalom. <sup>6</sup> The people therfore went out into the fielde a-
gainst Israel, & the battel was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
<sup>7</sup> And the people of Israel was slayne there of Dauids armie,
and there was made a great slaughter in that day, of twentie
thousand. <sup>8</sup> And the battel there was dispersed vpon the face
of al the earth, and there were manie moe, whom the forest
had consumed of the people, then they whom the sword
deuoured in that day. <sup>9</sup> And it chanced that Absalom mette
the seruantes of Dauid, sitting on a mule: and when the mule
was gone in vnder a thicke oke and a great, his head stucke to
the oke: and he hanging betwen heauen and earth, the mule
that he rode vpon passed through. <sup>10</sup> And one sawe this & told
Ioab: saying: I saw Absolom hang vpon an oke. <sup>11</sup> And Ioab
sayd to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst
thou not nayle him to the earth, and I had geuen thee ten
sicles of siluer, and one belt? <sup>12</sup> Who sayd to Ioab: If thou
wouldest pay downe in my handes a thousand peeces of
siluer, I would not lay my handes vpon the kinges sonne: for
in our hearing the king commanded thee, and Abisai, and
Ethai, saying: Keepe me the child Absalom. <sup>13</sup> Yea and if
I had done agaynst my life boldly, this could not haue beene
hid from the king, and thou wouldest haue stand agaynst it?
<sup>14</sup> And Ioab sayd: Not as thou wilt, but I wil set vpon him
before thee. He tooke therefore three lances in his hand,
and thrust them in the hart of Absalom: and when as
yet he panted for life sticking on the oke, <sup>15</sup> there ranne ten
yong men the squyers of Ioab, and striking they killed him.
