<sup>2</sup> the Heueite, and the Iebufcite, were gathered, to fight against Iosue and Israel with one minde, and one sentence:

<sup>3</sup> But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing al thinges that Iosue had done to Iericho and Hai: <sup>4</sup> craftily deuising tooke prouision for them selues, laying old sackes vpon their asses, and bottels of wine rent and sowed againe, <sup>5</sup> and shoes very old which for a shew of oldeneffe were clouted with speckes, putting on them old garmentes: the loaues also, which they caried for prouision by the way, were heard, and broken into peeces: <sup>6</sup> and they went on to Iosue, who then abode in the campe at Galgal, and said to him, and withal to al Israel: We are come from a farre countrie, desirous to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said: <sup>7</sup> Lest perhaps you dwel in the Land which is dew to vs by lotte, and we can not enter a league with you. <sup>8</sup> But they said to Iosue: We are thy seruantes. To whom Iosue said: Who are you? and whence came you? <sup>9</sup> they answered: From a very farre countrie are thy seruantes come in the name of the Lord thy God.

The garmentes and shoes that we haue vpon vs, and which we haue on our feete, for the length of the long way are worne, and almost consumed. <sup>14</sup> They tooke therfore of their victuals, and asked not the mouth of our Lord. <sup>15</sup> And Iosue made peace with them, and entring a league promised that they should not be slaine: the princes also of the multitude sware to them. <sup>16</sup> But three daies after that the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them. <sup>17</sup> And the children of Israel remoued the campe, and came into their cities the third day, whose names are these, Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim. <sup>18</sup> And they stroke them not, because
