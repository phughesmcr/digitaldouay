# Third booke: Salomon

Gentiles of al nations, then euer were in that of the Israelites or Iewes. Like-
wise, 1. Reg. 1. The same was both prefigured and prophesied by holie Anna:
The hungrie (those that desire to be instructed and saued) are filled: the
barren woman (the Church of the Gentiles) bare verie manie: & she that
had manie children was weakned. shewing that the Church of the Iewes
had manie, vntil the plenitude of Gentiles much more abounded. Wherefore the
Psalmist inuiteth al nations to praise God, saying Psal. 116. Praise our Lord
al ye Gentiles: praise him al ye peoples. Also 1. Reg. 7. God promised
Dauid, saying: Thy Kingdome for euer before thy face, and thy
throne shal be firme continually. which was not verified in Dauids tem-
poral kingdome. For it was quickly diuided, after Salomons death, and a smal
part left to his sonne Roboam. And after the captiuitie in Babylon, his seede
had onlie title and right without possession of royal throne. Againe 2. Reg.
22. The same royal prophet in his Canticle of thankes geuing, and last prophe-
tical wordes (chap. 23.) much preferreth the spiritual kingdome of Christ, be-
fore the earthlie kingdome of the Iewes. But most specially and plainly in the
Psalmes. Psal. 2. Why did the Gentiles rage, & peoples meditate vaine
thinges? Signifying that the furie of al aduersaries rageth in vaine, against
Christ and his Church. For, I am appointed, by him (sayth Christ of his
Father) king ouer Sion, his holie hil. I wil geue thee (sayth God to
his Sonne) the Gentiles for thine inheritance, and thy possession the
endes of the earth. Psal. 17. A people which I knew not, hath ser-
ued me. Psal. 44. The Queene (the Church) stood on thy right hand
in golden rayment, compassed with varietie: of vertues, and diuers
sortes of holie professions. Psal. 47. Mount Sion is founded with the ex-
ultation of the whole earth. For euer and euer he (Christ) shal rule
vs euermore. Psal. 86. Glorious thinges are sayd of thee, Ã´ citie of
God. But omitting innumerable other such textes, the 88. Psalme contayneth
a large prophecie of Christ and his Church, where S. Augustin geueth vs this
brief admonition. Christiani estis, Christum agnoscite. You are Chri-
stians, agnize Christ. I wil put (sayth God) his hand in the sea,
Christ: dominion in the Gentiles, and his right hand in the riuers: al for-
ces shal serue him. He shal be high aboue the kinges of the earth. Of
the Church he addeth: I wil put his seede for euer and euer, and his
throne as the dayes of heauen. Neither do sinnes frustrate this promise of
God, therfore it foloweth: But if his children shal forsake my law: and
wil not walke in my iudgements. If they shal profane my iustices,
and not keepe my commandements: I wil visite, wil Christ for al this
abandon his Church, as he did the old Synagogue, of which God sayth: Deut. 32.
They haue prouoked me in that which was no God: and I wil
prouoke them, in that which is no people? Not so. How then? I wil
