Priesthood to Samuel and Sadoch, and of the Kingdomes, to Dauid and his
Successors, prefigured the new Priesthood, and new Kingdome of Christ
the old ceasing which were shadowes therof. So these two great Doctors S.
Gregorie and S. Beda, insisting in the steppes of other lerned holie Fathers, that
had gone before them, expound these histories not only historically but also my-
stically. The historie first setteth forth the changing of the forme of gouernment
from Iudges to Kinges: and then at large what Kinges did reigne ouer the He-
brew people, as wel in one intire Realme, as ouer the same people diuided into
two kingdomes; their more principal Actes; their good and euil behauiour;
also the prosperitie, declinations, and final captiuities of both the Kingdomes.
Al which is conteined in foure bookes of Kinges, with other two partly
repeting that was saied before, but especially supplying thinges omitted in the
whole sacred historie from the beginning of the world, called Paralippome-
non. The two first are also called the Bookes of Samuel, though he writ not
one of them wholy, for he died before the historie of the former ended; but
they goe both vnder his name, because he annointed the two first Kinges, and
writ a great part of their Actes. Wherto the rest was added either by Dauid
and Salomon, as some thinke, or by Nathan and Gad, as is probably gathered,
1. Paralip. 29. v. 29. The authors also of the third and fourth bookes of
Kinges, and of the two of Paralippomenon are vncertaine; yet al haue euer
bene receiued and held for Canonical Scripture.
