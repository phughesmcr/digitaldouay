ouer the mouth of the wel, as it were drying sodde barley:
and so the thing was not knowen. <sup>20</sup> And when Absaloms
seruantes were come into the house, they sayd to the woman:
Where is Achimaas, and Ionathas? And the woman answe-
red them: They passed in hast, hauing tasted a litle water.
But they that sought, when they had not found, returned
into Ierusalem. <sup>21</sup> And when these were gone, they went vp
out of the wel, and going on told king Dauid, and sayd: Aryse
ye, and passe quickly the riuer: because this maner of counsel
hath Achitophel geuen against you. <sup>22</sup> Dauid therfore arose,
and al the people that was with him, and they passed ouer Ior-
dan, vntil it waxed light, and not one at al was remayning,
which did not passe the riuer. <sup>23</sup> Moreouer Achitophel seing
that his counsel was not executed, sadled his asse, and rose
and went into his house and into his citie: and taking order
with his house, hanged him self, and was buried in the se-
pulchre of his father. <sup>24</sup> But Dauid came into the Campe, and
Absalom passed ouer Iordan, he and al the men of Israel with
him. <sup>25</sup> But Absalom appoynted Amasa for Ioab ouer the
armie: and Amasa was the sonne of a man, which was called
Iethra of Iezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of
Naas, the sister of Saruia which was the mother of Ioab.
<sup>26</sup> And Israel camped with Absalom in the Land of Galaad.
<sup>27</sup> And when Dauid was come into the Campe, Sobi the sonne
of Naas of Rabbath the sonnes of Ammon, and Machir the
sonne of Amihel of Lodabar, & Berzellai the Galaadite of Ro-
gelim, <sup>28</sup> presented vnto him hanginges, and tapestrie, and
earthen vessels, wheate, and barley, and meale, and polent, and
beanes, and rishe, and fryed pease, <sup>29</sup> and honie, and butter,
sheepe, & fatte calues. and they gaue to Dauid and the people,
that was with him, to eate: for they suspected that the people
with hunger and thyrst was faynte in the desert.

CHAP. XVIII.

*King Dauid disposeth his armie in three partes, geuing special charge to saue
Absalom aliue. 9. Whom neuertheles (hanging by the heares of his head
in an oke) Ioab killeth: 16. and saueth the common people. 19. Which
Dauid vnderstanding greatly bewayleth Absalom.*

<sup>1</sup> DAVID therfore hauing viewed his people, appointed
ouer them tribunes & centurions, <sup>2</sup> and gaue the third
part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab, and the third part
