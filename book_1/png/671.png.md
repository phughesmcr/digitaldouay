CHAP. IX.

Miphiboseth a lame sonne of Ionathas is piously releeued by Dauid: 9. geuing
to his seruant the particular inheritance of Saul.

<sup>1</sup> AND Dauid sayd: Is there any thinke you that is remai-
ning of the house of Saul, that I may do mercie with
him for Ionathas sake? <sup>2</sup> And there was of the house of Saul,
a seruant named Siba: whom when the king had called vnto
him, he said to him: art thou Siba? And he answered: I am
so thy seruant. <sup>3</sup> And the king said: Is there anie remaining
of the house of Saul, that I may doe with him the mercie of
God? And Siba said to the king: There is yet liuing a sonne of
Ionathas, lame of his feete. <sup>4</sup> Where is he? quoth he. And Siba
sayd to the king: Behold he is in the house of Machir the
sonne of Ammiel in Lodabar. <sup>5</sup> King Dauid therefore sent,
and tooke him out of the house of Machir the sonne of Am-
miel of Lodabar. <sup>6</sup> And when Miphiboseth the sonne of
Ionathas the sonne of Saul was come to Dauid, he fel on his
face, and adored. And Dauid said: Miphiboseth? who an-
swered: Here I am thy seruant. <sup>7</sup> And Dauid said to him:
Feare not, because doing I wil do mercie on thee for Ionathas
thy father, & I wil restore thee landes of Saul thy father, and
thou shalt eate bread vpon my table alwaies. <sup>8</sup> Who adoring
him, said: Who am I thy seruant, that thou hast respect vpon
a dead dogge like vnto me? <sup>9</sup> The king therefore called
Siba the seruant of Saul, and said to him: Al thinges what-
soeuer were Sauls, and al his house, I haue geuen to thy ma-
sters sonne. <sup>10</sup> Til for him therefore the land, thou and thy
sonnes, and thy seruants: and thou shalt bring in meates for
thy masters sonne, that he may be maintained: and Miphi-
boseth the sonne of thy lord shal eate alwaies bread vpon
my table.
