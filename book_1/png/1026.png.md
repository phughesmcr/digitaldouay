<sup>3</sup> Grateful To-nefites? He hath led me and brought me agayne safe, he receiued the money of Gabelus, he caused me to haue my wife, and the euil spirit he chased from her, he made ioy vnto her parentes, my self he deliuered from being deuoured of the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heauen, and we are replenished with al good things by him. What can we geue him worthie for these things? <sup>4</sup> But I beseech thee my father, that thou desire him, if perhaps he wil vout-safe to take vnto him the one halfe of al thinges, which are brought. <sup>5</sup> And they calling him, to wit the father and the sonne, tooke him aside: & began to desire him that he would voutsafe to accept the halfe part of al thinges, that they had brought. <sup>6</sup> Then he sayd to them secretely: Blesse ye the God of heauen, and before al that liue confesse to him, be-cause he hath done mercie with you. <sup>7</sup> For to hide the se-crete of a king is good: but to reueale & confesse the workes of God is an honorable thing. <sup>8</sup> Prayer is good with fasting and almes, rather then to lay vp treasures of gold: <sup>9</sup> because almes deliuereth from death, and that is it which purgeth sinnes, and maketh to finde mercie and life euerlasting. <sup>10</sup> But they that committe sinne and iniquitie, are enemies to their owne soule. <sup>11</sup> I open therfore vnto you the truth, and I wil not hide from you the secrete word. <sup>12</sup> When thou didst pray with teares, and didst burie the dead and least thy dinner, and didest hide the dead by day in thy house, and by night didst burie them, <sup>13</sup> I offered thy prayer to our Lord. And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessarie that tentation should proue thee. <sup>14</sup> And now our Lord sent me to cure thee, and to deliuer Sara thy sonnes wife from the diuel. <sup>15</sup> For I am Raphael an Angel, one of the seuen, which assist before our Lord. <sup>16</sup> And when they had heard these thinges, they were trubled, & trembling fel vpon the ground on their face. <sup>17</sup> And the Angel sayd to them: Peace be to you, feare not. <sup>18</sup> For when I was with you, by the wil of God I was so: blesse ye him, and sing to him. <sup>19</sup> I seemed indeede to eate with you, and to drinke: but I vse an inuisible meate and drinke, which can not be seene of men. <sup>20</sup> It is time therfore that I returne to him, that sent me: but blesse ye God, and relat his maruelous workes. <sup>21</sup> And when he had sayd these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more. <sup>22</sup> Then prostrate for three houres vpon their face, they blessed God: and rysing vp they told al his maruelous workes.
