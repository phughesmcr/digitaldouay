<sup>15</sup> And when the next day was come, he tooke a couerlet, and powred water theron, and spred it vpon his face: who being dead, Hazael reigned for him. <sup>16</sup> In the fifth yeare of Ioram the sonne of Achab the king of Israel, and of Iosaphat the king of Iuda, reigned Ioram the sonne of Iosaphat the king of Iuda. <sup>17</sup> He was two and thirtie yeares old when he began to reigne, and he reigned eight yeares in Ierusalem. <sup>18</sup> And he walked in the waies of the kinges of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked: for the daughter of Achab was his wife: and he did that which is euil in the sight of our Lord. <sup>19</sup> But our Lord would not destroy Iuda, for Dauid his seruant, as he had promised him, to geue him a lampe to him, and to his children alwaies. <sup>20</sup> In his daies reuolted Edom, from being vnder Iuda, and made to itself a king. <sup>21</sup> And Ioram came to Seira, and al the chariotes with him: and he arose in the night, and stroke the Idumeans, that had beset him, and the captaynes of the chariotes, and the people fled into their tabernacles. <sup>22</sup> Edom therfore reuolted from being vnder Iuda, vntil this day. Then Lobna also reuolted at that time. <sup>23</sup> But the rest of the wordes of Ioram, and al that he did, are not these thinges written in the Booke of the wordes of the kinges of Iuda? <sup>24</sup> And Ioram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the Citie of Dauid, and Ochozias his sonne reigned for him. <sup>25</sup> In the twelfth yeare of Ioram the sonne of Achab the king of Israel, reigned Ochozias the sonne of Ioram the king of Iuda. <sup>26</sup> Two and twentie yeares old was Ochozias when he began to reigne, and he reigned one yeare in Ierusalem: the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri the king of Israel. <sup>27</sup> And he walked in the waies of the house of Achab: and he did that which is euil before our Lord, as the house of Achab: for he was the sonne in lawe of the house of Achab. <sup>28</sup> He went also with Ioram the sonne of Achab, to fight agaynst Hazael the king of Syria in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Ioram: <sup>29</sup> Who returned to be cured, in Iezrahel: because the Syrians wounded him in Ramoth fighting agaynst Hazael the king of Syria. Moreouer Ochozias the sonne of Ioram the king of Iuda, went downe to visite Ioram the sonne of Achab into Iezrahel, because he was sicke there.

<aside>Athalia v. 26. is called the daughter of Amri. Wher-fore it semeth that either she was the adop-ted daughter of her brother Achab, or is there called the daughter of her grand-father.</aside>
