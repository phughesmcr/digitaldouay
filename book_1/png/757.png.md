Ieroboam.

OF KINGES. 737

man of God, that was disobedient to the mouth of our Lord, and our Lord hath delivered him to the lion, & he hath torne him, and killed him according to the word of our Lord, that <sup>27</sup> he spake to him. And he sayd to his sonnes: Sadle me an <sup>28</sup> asse. Who when they had sadled, and he was gone, he found his dead bodie cast forth in the way, and the asse and the lion standing by the corse: the lion did not eate of the <sup>29</sup> dead bodie, nor hurt the asse. The prophet therefore tooke the corse of the man of God, and layd it vpon the asse, and returning brought it into the citie of the old prophete, that <sup>30</sup> they might mourne for him. And he layd his corse in his owne sepulchre: and they mourned for him: Alas, alas my <sup>31</sup> brother. And when they had mourned for him, he sayd to his sonnes: When I shal be dead, burie me in the sepulchre, wherein the man of God is buried: beside his bones lay my <sup>32</sup> bones. For assuredly the word shal come to passe, which he hath foretold in the word of our Lord agaynst the altar that is in Bethel: and agaynst al the temples of the excelses, <sup>33</sup> that are in the cities of Samaria. After these wordes Ieroboam returned not from his wicked way: but on the contrarie part he made of the most abiect of the people priestes of the excelses: Whosoeuer would, he filled his hand, and he <sup>34</sup> was made a priest of the excelses. And for this cause did the house of Ieroboam sinne, and was ouerthrowen, and destroyed from the face of the earth.
