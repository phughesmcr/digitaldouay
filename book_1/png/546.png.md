<sup>16</sup> diuided against it self, there was found contention of coura-
gious men.

<sup>17</sup> Galaad rested beyond Iordan, and Dan gaue him self to
shippes: Aser dwelt in the sea shore, and abode in hauens.

<sup>18</sup> But Zabulon and Nepthali offered their liues to death
in their countrie of Merome.

<sup>19</sup> The kinges came and fought, the kinges of Chanaan
fought in Thanac besides the waters of Mageddo, and yet
going a praying they tooke nothing.

<sup>20</sup> From heauen they fought against them: the starres re-
mayning in their order and course, fought against Sisara.

<sup>21</sup> The torrent of Cison drew their carcasses, the torrent
of Cadumim, the torrent of Cison: my soule tread downe the
strong ones.

<sup>22</sup> The hoofes of the horses fel of, the strongest of the ene-
mies fleeing violently, and falling downe headlong.

<sup>23</sup> Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the Angel of our Lord:
Curse the inhabitantes therof, because they came not to help
our Lord, to aide his most mightie ones.

<sup>24</sup> Blessed among wemen be Iahel the wife of Haber the
Cineite, and blessed be she in her tabernacle.

<sup>25</sup> To him that asked water she gaue milke, and in the
phial of princes she offered butter.

<sup>26</sup> Her left hand she put to the naile, and her right hand to
the smithes hammer, and stroke Sisara, seeking in his head a
place for the wound, and piercing valiantly through his
temple.

<sup>27</sup> Betwen her feete he fel: he failed, and died: he was row-
led before her feete, and he lay without life and miserable.

<sup>28</sup> Looking through a window, his mother howled: & she
spake out of a higher chamber: Why lingereth his chariote
to come backe? Wherfore are the feete of his waggans slow?

<sup>29</sup> One wiser then the rest of his wiues, answered these
wordes to her mother in law:

<sup>30</sup> Peraduenture now he diuideth the spoyles, and the fay-
rest of the wemen is chosen for him: garmentes of sundrie
colours are deliuered to Sisara for a praye, and diuerse furni-
ture is laid together to adorne the neckes.

<sup>31</sup> So perish al thine enemies O Lord: but they that loue
thee, as the Sunne shineth in his rysing, so let them glitter.

<sup>32</sup> And the Land rested for fourtie yeares.
