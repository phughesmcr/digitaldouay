the workes of thy handes, in the issue of thy wombe, and in
the fruite of thy cattel, in the fertilitie of thy ground, and in
the plentie of al thinges. For our Lord wil returne to reioyce
vpon thee in al riches, as he reioysed in thy fathers: <sup>10</sup> yet so,
if thou heare the voice of our Lord thy God, and keepe his
preceptes and ceremonies, which are written in this law:
and returne to our Lord thy God in al thy hart, and in al thy
soule. <sup>11</sup> This commandment, that I command thee this daie,
is not aboue thee, nor so farre of, <sup>12</sup> nor situated in heauen
that thou maiest say: Which of vs is able to ascend vnto
heauen to bring it to vs, that we may heare and fulfil it in
worke? <sup>13</sup> Nor placed beyond the sea: that thou mayest pre-
tend, and say: Which of vs can passe ouer the sea, and bring
it euen vnto vs: that we way heare, and doe that which is
commanded? <sup>14</sup> But the word is very neere thee, in thy
mouth and in thy hart, to doe it. <sup>15</sup> Consider that I haue
set before thee this day life and good, and contrariewi≈øe
death and euil: <sup>16</sup> that thou mayest loue our Lord thy God,
and walke in his waies, and keepe his commandmentes and
ceremonies and iudgementes: and thou mayest liue, and he
multiplie thee, and blesse thee in the Land, which thou shalt
enter to possesse. <sup>17</sup> But if thy hart be auerted, and thou wilt
not heare, and deceiued with errour thou adore strange
goddes, and serue them: <sup>18</sup> I foretel thee this day that thou
shalt perish, and abide a litle time in the Land, which passing
ouer Iordan, thou shalt enter to possesse. <sup>19</sup> I cal for wit-
nesses this day heauen and earth, that I haue proposed to you
life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therfore life,
that both thou mayest liue, and thy seede: <sup>20</sup> and mayest loue
our Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and cleaue to him (for
he is thy life, and the length of thy daies) that thou mayest
liue in the Land, for the which our Lord sware to thy fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, that he would geue it them.

CHAP. XXX.

[^1]: God wil circumcise thy hart.] Most true it is, that of our selues, without Gods grace none can kepe or fulfil the commandmentes. But he, whose hart God doth circumcise, is therby made able to loue God with al his hart, and with al his soule. And except some hartes were thus circumcised, and so made able to loue God aboue al, and consequently their neighboures, God should not performe his promise, that he wil circumcise the hartes of some.
