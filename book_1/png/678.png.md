Amnon rauisheth Thamar. 20. For which Absalom killeth him, 37. and flyeth into Gessur.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to passe after these thinges, that Amnon the sonne of Dauid loued the sister of Absalom the sonne of Dauid, being very beautiful, called Thamar, <sup>2</sup> and was fond on her exceedingly, so that for the loue of her he was sicke: because wheras she was a virgin, it semed vnto him hard to doe any thing vnhonestly with her. <sup>3</sup> But Amnon a freind, named Ionadab the sonne of Semmaa Dauids brother, a very wise man: <sup>4</sup> Who sayd to him: Why art thou so worne away with leauenes the kinges sonne, day by day? why doest thou not tel me? And Amnon sayd to him: I loue Thamar the sister of my brother Absalom. <sup>5</sup> To whom Ionadab answered: Lye vpon thy bed, and fayne sickenes: and when thy father shal come to visite thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray, come to me, to geue me meate, and to make me broth, that I may eate of her hand. <sup>6</sup> Amnon therefore lay downe, and began as it were to be sicke: and when the king came to visite him, Amnon sayd to the king: Let Thamar my sister come, I besech you, that she may make in my sight two litle suppinges, and I may take meate of her hand. <sup>7</sup> Dauid therfore sent home to Thamar, saying: Come into the house of Amnon thy brother, & make him broth. <sup>8</sup> And Thamar came into the house of Amnon her brother: and he lay, who taking meale tempered it: and resoluing it in his sight she made suppinges. <sup>9</sup> And taking that which she had boyled, she powred it out, and set it before him, and he would not eate: and Amnon sayd: Put forth al from me. And when they had put forth al, <sup>10</sup> Amnon sayd to Thamar: Bring in the meate into the parler, that I may eate of thy hand Thamar therfore tooke the suppinges, which she had made, and caryed it in to Amnon her brother in the parler. <sup>11</sup> And when she had offered him the meate, he caught her, and sayd: Come, lie with me my sister. <sup>12</sup> Who answered him: Doe not so my brother, doe not rauish me: for this is not lawful in Israel. Doe not this folie. <sup>13</sup> For I shal not be able to beare my reproch, and thou shalt be as one of the foolish in Israel: but rather speake to the king, and he wil not denie me to thee. <sup>14</sup> But he would not rest at her petitions, but preuayling by force
