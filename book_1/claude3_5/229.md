Manna.

And Aaron put it in the tabernacle to be reserued. <sup>36</sup> And the children of Israel did eate Manna fourtie yeares, til they came into the habitable land: with this meate were they fed, vntil they touched the borders of the land of Chanaan. <sup>37</sup> And a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XVI.

*Manhu*: *what is this*? When the people of Israel in the desert had spent their prouision of meate brought from Ægypt, and according to Gods promise had receiued store of quailes; going forth in the morning they sawe a strange thing lye vpon the ground like to hoare frost, wherat merueling they said one to an other: *Man hu*: which in their language signifieth *What is this*? Whereupon saith Theodoret (in Exod.) *they named that bread manna, and it was called Manna*. Which as the same and other ancient Doctors gather by the holie Scriptures, was a wonderful and miraculous meate, and withal a figure of a more excellent thing, long after promised, and geuen by our B. Sauiour, in the holie Sacrament of the Eucharist. As namlie S. Gregorie Nyssen (*tract. de vita Moysi, circa medium*) S. Ambrose (*l. de ijs qui myst. initiant. cap. 8.*) S. Cyril Alexandrinus, S. Chrysostom, S. Augustin, Theophilact and others, vpon the sixt of S. Iohn. Where also the text of our Sauiours long discourse with the Capharnaites, sheweth euidently that he promised to geue a farre better meate then Manna, to those that beleued in him. *I am*, saith our Lord, *the bread of life, your fathers did eate Manna in the desert, and died. This bread which I wil geue is my flesh, for the life of the world. My flesh is meate in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede* &c. S. Paul likewise teacheth (1. Cor. 10.) that this Manna, and the water issuing out of the rocke, were figures of the same B. Sacrament, as is noted in their places.

Here only we commend to the Christian readers remembrance that the thing figured, doth euer excede the figure (according to S Pauls doctrine, Coloss. 2.) wishing him therfore to consider, that in Manna were at least twelue clere miracles. First, it was made by Angels, wherof it is called, *the bread of Angels*. Secondly, it was produced from the earth, not water, as ordinarie meates are, but came from the ayre. Thirdly, how frostie soeuer anie man did gather it, in the end ech one had the same measure ful, called a gomor, and no more nor lesse. Fourthly, the sixth day (which was next before the Sabbath, that which they gathered, was found to be duble portion to other daies, that is, two gomors for euerie one. Fiftly, there fel none at al on the Sabbath day. Sixtly, if in the rest of the weeke anie part was left al night, it putrified, and was corrupt in the morning, but that which reuoie the Sabbath day, it remained sound and good. Seuenthly, notwithstanding diuersitie of stomakes, in so
