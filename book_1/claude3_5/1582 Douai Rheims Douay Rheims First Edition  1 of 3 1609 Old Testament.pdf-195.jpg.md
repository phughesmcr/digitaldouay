of Egypt. EXODVS. 175.

*servants*. Cha. 15. v. 15. *When Pharao had indurated himself*. And, [^1] How it is said, *Why do you harden your hearts*, as *Pharao and the Egyptians hardened their*? Al- which God cau- are reconciled with the other text, that *by God indurated Pharaos hart*: vnder- sed into the standing that phrase in like sense to this: (cha. 15. v. 4.) *God hath cast Pharao his sea, when him- chariots, and his armie into the sea*. Where God only permitted, and no way selfe ranne in forced Pharao and his armie, to follow the Hebrewes betwen the walles of wilfully: water. As before is here noted out of S. Basil, and S. Augustin, and the text it selfe maketh it euident. Againe manie other places confirme, that not God but the sinners owne wilfulnes, is the proper cause of his sinne. *Iob. 24. v. 13. Not man the cause They are rebellious to the light*. God hath geuen him place for penance, and he abuseth it vnto pride. *Eccl. 8. of sinne: proued v. 11. Because sentence is not quickly pronounced against the euil, the children by other scrip- of men commit euils without al feare*. *Ose. 13. v. 9. Perdition is thine, O Israel, only tures*. in me thy helpe*. *Rom. 2. v. 4. The benignitie of God bringeth thee to penance*: but according to thy hardnes, and impenitent hart, thou heapest to thy selfe wrath. *Ephes. 4. v. 19. Gentiles haue geuen vp themselues to impudicitie* (*or vncleannes*.) And manie like places shew, that God is not the mouer, author, nor forcer of anie thing, that is sinne: but man him selfe is the author by wilfully consenting to tentations of the diuel, the flesh, and the world, and by abusing Gods benefites, and resisting his grace.

<aside>True miracles, being aboue the course of al created nature, can not be wrought but by the power of God, who is truth it selfe, and can not geue testimonie to vntruth, and therfore certainly proue that to be true, for which they are done. Other strange things done by enchanters, false prophetes, and diuels, are not in deede true miracles, but either sleightes, by quicknes and nimblenes of hand, called leger-demain, or bringing one thing away and bringing an other; or false pretentions deceiuing the senses, and imaginations of men, by making thinges seme to be that they are not; or els are wrought by applying natural causes knowen to some, especially to diuels, who also by their natural force can do great thinges, when God permitteth them. And so by enchantments and certaine sciences, these sorcerers either conueyed away the roddes, and water, and brought dragons, and bloud in their place, & more frogges, from other places; or els by the diuels vsing natural agentes turned roddes into serpentes, water into bloud, & other matter into frogges: al which might be done naturally in longer time, & by the diuels in short time. But manie thinges are wholy aboue the diuels power: as to destroy the world, to change the general order therof; to create of nothing; to raise the dead to life, to geue sight to the borne blind, the like, which are Gods proper workes. In things also diuels naturally can do, they are much restrayned by Gods goodnes, lest they should deceiue, or hurt mankind at their pleasure. So these Enchanters fayled in the fourth attempt, not able to make more sciniphes, nor anie more such prodigies: and were only permitted to produce such serpents, as were deuoured by Aarons serpent: and to change water into bloud: and to increase the number of frogges, for the greater plague, and no profite of the Egyptians. Neither could they remoue anie plague. Nay themselues were so plagued with boyles, that for paine, or for shame, they could not stand before Moyses.</aside>

It is further to be obserued, that when anie haue attempted to worke miracles to proue false doctrin, they haue failed, and by Gods prouidence bene confounded. As when Baals false prophetes, crying to their false goddes from morning til noone, could not bring fire for their sacrifice: and yet the true God when they brought fire to burne Iobs shepe and seruants; God permitting the one, and preuenting by
