the number of the captiues a beautiful woman, and louest
her, and wilt haue her to wife, <sup>12</sup> thou shalt bring her into
thy house: who shal shaue of her hare, and payre her nailes,
<sup>13</sup> and put of the rayment, wherein she was taken: and sitting
in thy house, shal mourne her father and mother one moneth:
and afterward thou shalt enter vnto her, and shalt sleepe
with her, and she shal be thy wife. <sup>14</sup> But if afterward she
content not thy mynde, thou shalt let her goe free, neither
canst thou sel her for money, nor oppresse her by might: because thou hast humbled her. <sup>15</sup> If a man haue two wiues,
one beloued, and the other hated, and they haue begotten
children by him, and the sonne of the hated be the firstborne,
<sup>16</sup> and he meaneth to diuide his substance among his sonnes:
he can not make the sonne of the beloued the first borne, and
preferre him before the sonne of the hated, <sup>17</sup> but the sonne
of the hated he shal acknowledge for the first borne, and
shal geue to him of those thinges, which he hath, al duble:
for this is the beginning of his children, & to this are dew the
first birth rightes. <sup>18</sup> If a man begette a stubbourne and froward sonne, that wil not heare the commandementes of his
father and mother, and being chastened, contemneth to be
obedient: <sup>19</sup> they shal take him, and bring him to the ancientes of his citie, and to the gate of iudgement, <sup>20</sup> and
shal say to them: This our sonne is froward and stubborne,
he contemneth to heare our admonitions, he geueth himself
to comessation, and to ryote and bankeringes: <sup>21</sup> the people
of the citie shal stone him: and he shal die, that you may
take away the euil out of the middes of you, and al Israel
hearing it may be afrayde. <sup>22</sup> When a man hath offended so
that he is to be punished by death, and being condemned to
die is hanged on a gybbet: <sup>23</sup> his bodie shal not remaine vpon
the tree, but the same day shal be buried: because he is accursed of God that hangeth on a tree: and thou shalt not
contaminate thy Land, which our Lord thy God geueth thee
in possession.

<aside>Mystically, he is cursed that persisteth in sinne, as it were hanging on the tree, by which our first parents sinned</aside>
