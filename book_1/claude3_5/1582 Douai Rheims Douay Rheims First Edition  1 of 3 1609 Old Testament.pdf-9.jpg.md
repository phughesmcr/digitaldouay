# To the English Reader

Some wordes cannot be turned into English.

kepe the word, as we find it, or only turne it to our English termination, because it would otherwise require manie wordes in English, to signifie one word of another tongue. In which cases, we commonly put the explication in the margent: Briefly our Apologie is easie against English Protestantes; because they also reserue some wordes in the original tongues, not translated into English: as *Sabbath, Ephod, Pentecost, Proselyte*, and some others. The sense wherof is in dede as soone lerned, as if they were turned so nere as is possible into English. And why then may we not say *Prepuce, Phase* or *Pasch, Azimes, Breades of Proposition, Holocaust*, and the like? rather then as Protestantes translate them: *Foreskinne, Passeouer, The feast of sweete breades, Shewe breades, Burnt offerings*: &c. By which termes, whether they be truly translated into English or no, we wil passe ouer. Sure it is an English man is stil to seke, what they meane, as if they remained in Hebrew, or Greke. It more importeth, that nothing be wittingly and falsly translated, for aduantage of doctrine in matter of faith. Wherein as we dare boldly auouch the sinceritie of this Translation, and that nothing is here either vntruly, or obscurely donne of purpose, in fauour of Catholique Romane Religion: so we can not but complaine, and chalenge English Protestantes, for corrupting the text, contrarie to the Hebrew, & Greke, which they professe to translate, for the more shew, and mainteyning of their peculiar opinions against Catholiques. As is proued in the Discouerie of manifold corruptions. For example we shal put the reader in memorie of one or two.

Gen. 4. v. 7. whereas (God speaking to Cain) the Hebrew wordes in Grammatical construction may be translated either thus: *Vnto thee also perteineth the lust* THEROF, *& thou shalt haue dominion ouer* IT: or thus; *Also vnto thee* HIS *desire shal be subiect, & thou shalt rule ouer* HIM: though the coherece of the text requireth the former, & in the Bibles printed 1552. and. 1577. Protestantes did so translate it: yet in
