# Deuteronomie.

[^1]: Apostles, in general is conteined in the law of Moyses, so also are certaine fastes, feastes, rites, ceremonies and other traditions proued and confirmed by general speaches and axiomes written in holie Scriptures, as by our Sauiours wordes to his Apostles Luc. 10. *He that heareth you, heareth me*. S. Paules to other Christians (1. Cor. 10.) *other thinges when I come I wil dispose*. (1. Thess. 2.) *Hold the traditions which you haue lerned*: and the like. Wherupon S. Augustin *Ep. 118. cont. Cresen. c. 33.* geueth this rule, that *albeit an euident example can not be produced of some particular thing, yet the truth of the same scriptures is holden by vs, when we do that pleaseth the whole Church, which the authoritie of Scripture commendeth*. The same he teacheth *Epist. 80.* and in manie other places. So do S. Epiphanius *in compend. fidei Cathol.* S. Hierom. Dialog. cont. Lucifer. c. 4. S. Chrysost. *ho. 4. in 1. Thess.* 4. S. Basil. *de spiritu Sancto, c. 39.* S. Ireneus *li. 3. c. 4.*

## Chap. V.

*The tenne commandements are repeted and explaned. 23. With commemoration of their dread and feare, when they heard the voice from the cloudes, and saw the mountaine burne.*

<sup>1</sup>AND Moyses called al Israel, and said to them: Heare Israel the ceremonies & iudgements, which I speake in your eares this day: lerne them, and fulfil them in worke. <sup>2</sup>The Lord our God made a couenant with vs in Horeb. <sup>3</sup>Not with our fathers did he make the couenant, but with vs at this present, and doe liue. <sup>4</sup>Face to face did he speake to vs in the mount out of the middes of the fyre. <sup>5</sup>I was arbiter and mediatour betwixt our Lord and you at that time, to shew you his wordes, for you feared the fire, and went not vp into the mount, and he said: <sup>6</sup>I the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Ã†gypt out of the house of seruitude. <sup>7</sup>Thou shalt not haue strange goddes in my sight. <sup>8</sup>Thou shalt not make to thee a thing grauen, nor the similitude of any thinges, that are in heauen aboue, and that are in the earth beneath, and that abide in the waters vnder the earth. <sup>9</sup>Thou shalt not adore them, and thou shalt not serue them. For I am the Lord thy God, a Ielouse God, rendering the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children vnto the third and fourth generation to them that hate me, <sup>10</sup>and doing mercie vpon manie thousandes to them that loue me, and keepe my preceptes. <sup>11</sup>Thou shalt not vsurpe the name of the Lord thy God in vaine: for he shal not be vnpunished that taketh his name vpon a vaine thing. <sup>12</sup>Obserue the day of the Sabbath, to sanctifie it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee. <sup>13</sup>Six dayes shalt thou worke, and shalt doe al thy workes. <sup>14</sup>The seuenth is the day of the Sabbath,

<aside>:: It is not ynough to belene only, or to know the commandments, but necessarie also to fulfil them in worke.</aside>
