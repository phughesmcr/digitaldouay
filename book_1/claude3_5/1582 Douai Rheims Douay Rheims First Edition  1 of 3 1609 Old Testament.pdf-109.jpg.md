have deluded him, and I shal bring vpon me a curse for a
blessing. <sup>13</sup> To whom his mother said: This curse, my sonne,
light vpon me: only heare thou my voice, and go, fetch me
the things which I have said. <sup>14</sup> He went, and brought,
and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, even as
she knew his father liked. <sup>15</sup> And she did on him the garments of Esau verie good, which she had at home with her:
<sup>16</sup> and the litle skinnes of the kidds she put about his hands,
and covered the bare of his necke. <sup>17</sup> And she gave him the
broth, and delivered him bread that she had baked. <sup>18</sup> Which
when he had caried in, he said: My father? But he answered:
I heare. Who art thou my sonne? <sup>19</sup> And Iacob said: "I am
thy first begotten Esau: I have done as thou didest command me: arise, sit, and eate of my hunting, that thy soule

Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my sonne, that my soule
may blesse thee. Which when they were brought and he
had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had

kisse, my sonne. <sup>27</sup> He came neere, and kissed him. And immediatly as he felt the fragrant sauoure of his garments, blessing
him, he said: Behold the sauoure of my sonne is as the sauoure of a plentiful field, which our Lord hath blessed.
<sup>28</sup> God geue thee of the deaw of heaven, and of the fatnes of
the earth abundance of corne and wine. <sup>29</sup> And let peoples
serue thee, and tribes adore thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and thy mothers children bowe they before thee.
He that shal curse thee, be he cursed: and he that shal blesse
thee, be he replenished with blessings. <sup>30</sup> Isaac had scarce
ended his wordes, and Iacob now gone forth abroad, but
