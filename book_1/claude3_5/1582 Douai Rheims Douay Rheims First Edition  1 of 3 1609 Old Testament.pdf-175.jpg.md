# THE BOOKE OF EXODVS. IN HEBREW VEELLE SEMOTH.

## CHAP. I.

*The smal number of Israelites much increasing in Ægypt, 6. specially after the death of Ioseph and his brethren, 8. a new king, that knew not Ioseph in vaine striueth to hinder their multiplication, 11. by imposing workes vpon them, 15. and by commanding to kil, 22. and to drowne al the malchildren of them. God in the meane time rewardeth the midwiues, that fearing him, killed not the children.*

<sup>1</sup> THESE be the names of the children of Israel, that entred into Ægypt with Iacob : they did enter in euerie one with his housholde, <sup>2</sup> Ruben, Simeon, <sup>3</sup> Leui, Iudas, <sup>4</sup> Issachar, Zabulon, and Beniamin, <sup>5</sup> Dan, and Neptali, Gad, and Aser. <sup>6</sup> Therefore al the soules that came out of Iacobs thigh, were seuentie: and Ioseph was in Ægypt. <sup>7</sup> Who being dead and al his brethren, and al that generation, <sup>8</sup> the children of Israel increased, and as it were springing vp did multiplie : and growing strong exceedingly, filled the land. <sup>9</sup> In the meane time there arose a new king ouer Ægypt, that knew not Ioseph: <sup>10</sup> and he said to his people : Behold the people of the children of Israel is much, and stronger then we. <sup>11</sup> Come, let vs wisely oppresse the same, lest perhaps it multiplie : and if there shal be anie warre against vs, it ioyne with our enemies, and we being ouercome they depart out of the land. <sup>12</sup> Therfore he set ouer them maisters of the workes, to afflict them with burdens: and they built vnto Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom, and Ramesses. <sup>13</sup> And the more they did oppresse them, so much the more they multiplied, and increased:
