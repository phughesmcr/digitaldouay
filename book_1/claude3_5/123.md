Laban called The witnesse heape : and Iacob called The hillock of testimonie, either of them according to the pro<sup>48</sup>prietie of his language. And Laban said : This heape shal be a witnes betwene me and thee this day, and therfore the name therof was called Galaad, that is, The witnes heape. <sup>49</sup>Our Lord behold and iudge betwen vs when we shal be <sup>50</sup>departed one from the other, if thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wiues ouer them : none is witnes of our talke but God, who is present and behol<sup>51</sup>deth. And he said againe to Iacob : Behold this heape, and the stone which I haue erected betwen me and thee, <sup>52</sup>shal be a witnes : this heape, I say, and the stone be they for a testimonie, if either I shal passe beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt passe beyond it, thinking harme <sup>53</sup>to me. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor iudge betwen vs, the God of their father. Iacob therfore <sup>54</sup>sware by the feare of his father Isaac : and after he had offered victimes in the mountaine, he called his brethren to <sup>55</sup>eate bread. Who when they had eaten, lodged there : but Laban arising in the night, kissed his sonnes, and daughters, and blessed them : and returned vnto his place.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXXI.

<aside>Images of false goddes (as these were) are most properly called idols. And so the hebrew word *Teraphim* is here rightly translated idols, which in other places signifieth other things. As The statua which Michol put in Dauids bed, couering the head therof with a hearie goates skinne, to deceiue Saules seriantes (1. Reg. 19.) is called *teraphim*, and may there be translated a statua, image, or similitude, but not an idol. Againe, Osee the Prophet foretelling the lamentable state of the Israelites, sayth, they shal be long without King, prince, sacrifice, altar, ephod, and *teraphim*, which last word in the Protestant English Bibles remaineth vntranslated. Where if they had translated *Images* (as here they doe) it would proue, that some images pertaine to true religion, the want wherof is lamen-ted among other principal things.</aside>

[^1]: Idols.

[^2]: Images of false goddes are idols.

[^3]: Some images are neither religious nor superstitious.

[^4]: Some are religious.

[^5]: Rachel tooke away her fathers Idols, for his good.

These Idol. Rachel stole from her father, to withdraw him from idolatrie. as S. Basil (in lib. Prouerb.) S. Gregorie Naziamen. (orat. de Paschate) and Theodoret. (q. 89. in Gen.) expound it. And in this, saith Theodoret, she was a right figure of the Catholique Church, which depriueth idolaters of their idols. It is probable also by her base vsing of them, that she held them not for goddes, when she put them vnder the camels litter, and sate vpon them. Finally that she refused them, and did not cal them away, nor burne them.
