<sup>28</sup> for how much soever it was estemed by thee. Anie thing that is consecrated to the Lord, whether it be man, or beast, or field, shal not be sould, neither can it be redemed. Whatsoever is once consecrated, shal be holie of holies to <sup>29</sup> the Lord. And any consecration, that is offered of a man, <sup>30</sup> shal not be redemed, but dying shal die. Al tithes of the land, whether of corne, or of the fruites of trees, are the <sup>31</sup> Lordes, and are sanctified to him. And if anie man wil <sup>32</sup> redeme his tithes, he shal adde the fift part of them. Of al the tithes of oxen, and sheepe and goates, that passe vnder the sheepheardes rodde, everie tenth that commeth <sup>33</sup> shal be sanctified to the Lord. It shal not be chosen neither good nor bad, neither shal it be changed for an other. If anie man change it: both that which was changed, and that for the which it was changed, shal be sanctified to the <sup>34</sup> Lord, and shal not be redemed. These are the precepts, which our Lord commanded Moyses vnto the children of Israel in the mount Sinai.

ANNOTATIONS:
CHAP. XXVII.

[^1] The first borne. God here forbiddeth to vow the first borne, and geveth the reason, for that they are the Lordes, shewing that those things, wherto we are already bound, are not properly matter of vow. But a vowe properly is a religious promise voluntarily made to God, of a good thing, vnto which we were not bound. And that the same is verie grateful to God, appeareth not only in this chapter, and in manie other places of Moyses law, but also in the law of nature *Gen. 28*. Iacob vowed, and God accepted therof. *Gen. 31*. *v. 13*. And the royal Prophet in divers Psalmes pertaining to the new Testament commendeth vowes. It is certaine also S. Paul, 1. *Tim. 5*. that widowes did lawfully vowe chastitie in the primitive Church: and such as did afterward breake the same, did violate their promise to God. Innumerable also most lerned and most godlie fathers, have ever from Christs time both taught and practised religious vowes, of obedience to superiors, who otherwise had no authoritie over them, and of perpetual chastitie, and voluntarie povertie. It is likewise, and continually hath benne, a most common practise in the Church, to vow other good workes of pietie, as to visite holie places, to build Churches, Colleges, Hospitals, and the like, being no way bound therto but of mere devotion. *See An-notation. 1. Tim. 5*.
