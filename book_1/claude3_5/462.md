the wenches father, because he hath infamously spred a
verieil name vpon a virgin of Israel: and he shal haue her
to wife, and can not put her away al the daies of his life.
<sup>20</sup> But if it be true which he obiected, and virginitie be not
found in the wench: <sup>21</sup> they shal cast her forth without the
doores of her fathers house, and the men of her citie shal
stone her to death, and she shal die: because she hath done
wickednes in Israel, to fornicate in her fathers house: and
thou shalt take away the euil out of the middes of thee. <sup>22</sup> If
a man lie with an others mans wife, both shal die, that is to
say, the aduouterer and the aduouteresse: and thou shalt
take away the euil out of Israel. <sup>23</sup> If a man haue despoused
a maide that is a virgine, and some man finde her in the citie,
and lie with her, <sup>24</sup> thou shalt bring forth both of them to
the gate of that citie, and they shal be stoned: the maide, be-
cause she cried not, being in the citie: the man, because he
hath humbled his neighbours wife: and thou shalt take away
the euil from the middes of thee. <sup>25</sup> But if the man finde
the maide that is despoused, in the field, and taking her, lie
with her, he alone shal die: <sup>26</sup> the maide shal suffer nothing,
neither is she guiltie of death: for as a theefe ryseth against his
brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the maide suffer.
<sup>27</sup> she was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man
to deliuer her. <sup>28</sup> If a man finde a maide that is a virgin, which
hath not a spouse, and taking her lie with her, and the matter
come into iudgement: <sup>29</sup> he that lay with her, shal geue to
the father of the maide fiftie sicles of siluer, and shal haue her
to wife, because he hath humbled her: he can not put her
away al the daies of his life. <sup>30</sup> No man shal take his fathers
wife, nor reuele his couering.
