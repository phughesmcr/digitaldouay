our Lord sayd: Stretch thy hand, and catch the tayle therof. He stretched it forth, & tooke hold of it, and it was turned into a rodde. <sup>5</sup>That they may beleue, quoth he, that the Lord God of their fathers hath appeared to thee, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, & the God of Iacob. <sup>6</sup>And our Lord sayd agayne: Put thy hand into thy bosome. Which when he had put into his bosome, he brought it forth ful of leproſie like ſnow. <sup>7</sup>Draw backe, quoth he, thy hand into thy boſome. He drew it backe, and brought it forth agayne, & it was like the other flesh. <sup>8</sup>If they wil not beleue thee, quoth he, nor heare the word of the former signe, they wil beleue the word of the signe folowing. <sup>9</sup>And if so be they wil beleue neither of these two signes, nor heare thy voice: take water of the riuer, & powre it out vpon the drie land, and whatſoeuer thou drawest of the riuer, shal be turned into bloud. <sup>10</sup>Moyſes ſayd: I beſeech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy ſeruant, I haue more impediment & ſlownes of tongue. <sup>11</sup>Our Lord ſayd to him: Who made the mouth of man? or who framed the dumme and deafe, the ſeeing and the blinde? did not I? <sup>12</sup>Goe on therfore, and I wil be in thy mouth: & wil teach thee what thou shalt speake. <sup>13</sup>But he ſayd: I beſeech thee, Lord, ſend whom thou wilt ſend. <sup>14</sup>Our Lord being angrie at Moyſes, ſayd: Aaron thy brother the leuite, I know that he is eloquẽt: behold he cometh forth to meete thee, & ſeeing thee shal be glad at the hart. <sup>15</sup>Speake to him, and put my wordes in his mouth: & I wil be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and wil shew you what yee must doe. <sup>16</sup>He shal speake in thy steed to the people, and shal be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in thoſe thinges that perteine to God. <sup>17</sup>This rodde alſo take in thy hand, wherwith thou shalt doe the signes. <sup>18</sup>Moyſes went his way, & returned to Iethro his father in law, and ſayd to him: I wil goe and returne to my brethren into Ægypt, that I may ſee if they be yet aliue. To whom Iethro ſayd: Goe in peace. <sup>19</sup>Therfore our Lord ſayd to Moyſes in Madian: Goe, and returne into Ægypt: for they are al dead that ſought thy life. <sup>20</sup>Moyſes therfore tooke his wife, & his children, and ſet them vpon an aſſe: and returned into Ægypt, carying the rodde of God in his hand. <sup>21</sup>And our Lord ſaid to him returning into Ægypt:
