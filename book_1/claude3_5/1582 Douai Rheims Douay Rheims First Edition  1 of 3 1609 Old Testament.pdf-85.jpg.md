### CHAP. XVII.

<sup>5</sup> *Manie nations:* Abram signifying *High* or *Noble father*, changed into Abraham, which signifieth *father of manie* (nations) and Sarai signifying *My princess*, changed into Sara, which absolutly signifieth *Princesse*, importe great mystical. S. Aug. Mysterie intended by God. For by this changing of names was declared and li. 16. c.26. confirmed, that Abraham by the issue that he should haue of Sara, should be ciuit. S. Hie- the father of manie nations, which S. Paul expressly applieth to his spiritual rom. Tradit. children, those especially that should beleeue in Christ, of the Gentiles prefi- Hebraicis. gured by *Isaac*, *one of the free woman, by the promise*, as the Iewes were prefigured by *Ismael borne of the bond woman according to the flesh*, concluding with the prophet Osee, that *where are not the children of the dispised, there shal be our conuersion*. For albeit Abraham was natural father of some nations, The Ismaelites, Madiani- tes, Idumeans, and the Israelites, yet he was spiritual father of manie more, to wit, of al nations that beleeue in Christ from his owne time to the end of the world, of which some are Iewes, but the greatest part Gentiles: as the same Apostle sheweth Rom. 4. Gal. 4. Ephes. 3. Collos. 3. and in other places, wher- by it is clere, that the Church of Christ doth alwayes consist of manie nations, not as Donatistes and Protestants absurdly say, sometimes of few inuisible or vnknowen persons, for so Abraham should sometimes be father of few or no nations, which derogateth either from Gods omnipotence if he could not, or from his fidelitie if he should not maintaine his promise, made to Abraham for euer.

<sup>10</sup> *Shal be circumcised:* The Sacrament of Circumcision here first insti- tuted, about 400. yeares before Moyses, is a perfect figure of Bap- tisme, resembling it in foure things: First by both these Sacraments the faith- ful are distinguished from infidels. Secondly profession of faith is made in them both, either by themselues the same, if they be of discretion, or by others for them, if they be infants. Thirdly by both these Sacraments entrance is made into the Church, and to the participation of other Sacraments and spiritual rites. Fourthly both these Sacraments induce subiection to the iuris- diction, and lawes of the Church. But Baptisme doth farre excel Circumci- sion in that it is more easie, or lesse painful, more vniuersal, for it pertaineth to al nations, and both sexes; and especially in vertue and efficacie, for Bap- tisme as an instrumental cause remitteth sinne and iustifieth, Circumcision was only a signe that grace was remitted. Againe Baptisme imprin- teth a character in the soule, the other leaueth a marck only in the flesh. Fi- nally Baptisme openeth the gate of heauen, in vertue of Christs passion now past, which Circumcision could not before Christ suffered death. Of which both resemblance and difference S. Augustin treateth in manie places, especi- ally li. 4. de doct. christ c. 9. Epist. 118. and Ianuarium. li. 19. c. 13. cont. Faust & in Psal. 73. where he also maketh like comparison betwen other Sacraments of the old and new Testament.

<sup>11</sup> *Shal be circumcised:* Here occurre two difficulties about the true sense of this hard place. First whether this punishment belonged to them only, whose fault circumcision was omitted; or to infants also that should be cir- cumcised and were not. Secondly whether temporal punishment, or eternal
