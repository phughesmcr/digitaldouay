<sup>7</sup> cast into the flame, that wasteth the cow. And then at length washing his garmentes, and his bodie, he shal enter <sup>8</sup> into the campe, and shal be polluted vntil euen. But he also that burneth her, shal wash his garmentes and his bodie, <sup>9</sup> and shal be vnclean vntil euen. And a man that is cleane shal gather the ashes of the cow, and shal powre them out without the campe in a most cleane place, that they may be reserued for the multitude of the children of Israel, and for water of aspersion: because the cowe was burnt for sinne. <sup>10</sup> And when he that caried the ashes of the cow, hath washed his garmentes, he shal be vnclean vntil euen. The children of Israel, and the strangers that dwel among them, shal haue <sup>11</sup> this for a holie thing by a perpetual ordinance. He that toucheth the dead corps of a man, and is vncleane therfore <sup>12</sup> seuen daies: shal be sprinkled of this water the third day, and the seuenth, and so shal be cleansed. If he were not sprinkled, the third day the seuenth day he can not be clensed. <sup>13</sup> Euerie one that toucheth the dead corps of mans soule, and is not sprinkled with this commission, shal pollute the tabernacle of the Lord, and shal perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled with the water of expiation, he shal be <sup>14</sup> vncleane, and his filthiness shal remaine vpon him. This is the law of the man that dieth in a tabernacle: Al that enter into his tent, and al the vessel that are there, shal be polluted <sup>15</sup> seuen daies. The vessel, that hath no couer, nor bynding <sup>16</sup> ouer it, shal be vncleane. If any man in the field touch the corps of a man that was slaine, or that died of himself, or <sup>17</sup> his bone, or graue, he shal be vncleane seuen daies. And they shal take of the ashes of combustion and of sinne, and <sup>18</sup> shal powre liuing water vpon them into a vessel. in the which when a man that is cleane hath dipped hyssope, he shal sprinkle therwith al the tent, and al the implementes, and the <sup>19</sup> men polluted with such contagion: and in this maner he that is cleane shal purge the vncleane the third and seuenth day. And being expiated the seuenth day, he shal wash both himself and his garmentes, and be vncleane vntil euening. <sup>20</sup> If anie man be not expiated after this rite, his soule shal perish out of the middes of the Church: because he hath polluted the Lordes Sanctuarie, and is not sprinkled with water <sup>21</sup> of lustration. This precept shal be an ordinance for euer. He also that sprinkleth the waters, shal wash his garmentes:
