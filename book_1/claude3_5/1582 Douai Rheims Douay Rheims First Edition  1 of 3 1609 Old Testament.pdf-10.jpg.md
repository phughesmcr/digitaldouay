# To the English Reader

the yeare 1579. and 1603. they translate it the other way, rather saying, that Abel was subject to Cain, and that Cain by Gods ordinance, had dominion ouer his brother Abel, then that concupiscence or lust of sinne is subject to mans wil, or that man hath powre of free wil, to resist (by Gods grace) tentation of sinne. But as we heare in a new Edition (which we haue not yet sene) they translate it almost as in the first. In like sorte Gen. 14. v. 18. The Hebrew particle VAV, which S. Ierom, and al Antiquitie translated ENIM (For) Protestants wil by no meanes admitte it, because (besides other argumentes) we proue therby Melchisedechs Sacrifice. And yet themselues translate the same, as S. Ierom doth, *Gen. 20. v. 3.* saying: FOR *she is a mans wife*. &c. Againe *Gen. 31. v. 19.* the English Bibles. 1552. and 1577. translate *Theraphim*, IMAGES. Which the Edition of 1603. correcting, translateth IDOLES. And the marginal Annotation wel proueth, that it ought to be so translated.

With this then we wil conclude most deare (we speake to you al, that vnderstand our tongue, whether you be of contrarie opinions in faith, or of mundane feare participate with another Congregation; or professe with vs the same Catholique Religion) to you al we present this worke: dayly beseeching God Almightie, the Diuine Wisdom, Eternal Goodnes, to create, illuminate, and replenish your spirites, with his Grace, that you may attaine eternal Glorie. euerie one in his measure, in those manie Mansions, prepared and promised by our Sauiour in his Fathers house. Not only to those which first receiued, & folowed his Diuine doctrine, but to al that should afterwardes beleue in him, & kepe the same preceptes. For there is one God, one also Mediatour of God and men: Man Christ Iesus. Who gaue himself a Redemption for al. Whereby appeareth his wil, that al should be saued. Why then are not al saued? The Apostle addeth: that they must first come to the knowlege of the truth. Because without faith it is impossible to please God.

[^1]: Against free wil.

[^2]: Against Melchisedechs sacrifice.
