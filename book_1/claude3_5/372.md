not see the Land for the which I sware to their fathers, neither shal any of them that hath detracted me, behold it. <sup>24</sup> My seruant Caleb, who being ful of an other spirit hath folowed me, wil I bring in vnto this Land which he hath circuted: and his seede shal possesse it. <sup>25</sup> Because the Amalecite and the Cananeite dwel in the valleies. To morrow remoue the campe, and returne into the wildernesse by the way of the Redde sea. <sup>26</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses and Aaron, saying: <sup>27</sup> How long doth this vngrarious multitude murmur against me? I haue heard the complaintes of the children of Israel. <sup>28</sup> Say therfore to them: liue I, sayeth our Lord: According as you haue spoken I hearing it, so wil I do to you. <sup>29</sup> In this wildernesse shal your carcasses lie. Al you that are numbered from twentie yeares & vpward, and haue murmured against me, <sup>30</sup> you shal not enter into the Land, ouer the which I haue lifted vp my hand to make you inhabite it, except Caleb the sonne of Iephone, and Iosue the sonne of Nun. <sup>31</sup> But your litle ones, of whom you said, that they should be a pray to the enemies, wil I bring in: that they may see the Land, that hath misliked you. <sup>32</sup> Your carcasses shal lie in the wildernesse. <sup>33</sup> Your children shal wander in the desert fourtie yeares, and shal beare your fornication, vntil the carcasses of their fathers be consumed in the desert, <sup>34</sup> according to the number of the fourtie daies, wherin you viewed the Land: a yeare shal be reputed for a day. And fourtie yeares you shal receiue your iniquities, and shal know my reuenge: <sup>35</sup> for as I haue spoken, so wil I doe to al this wicked multitude, that hath risen together against me: in this wildernesse shal it faile, and die. <sup>36</sup> Therfore al the men, whom Moyses had sent to view the Land, and which returning had made al the multitude to murmur against him, detracting from the Land that it was naught, <sup>37</sup> died and were stroken in the sight of our Lord. <sup>38</sup> But Iosue the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephone liued of al them, that had gone to view the Land. <sup>39</sup> And Moyses spake al these wordes to al the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly. <sup>40</sup> And behold very early in the morning rising they went vp to the toppe of the mountaine, and said: We are readie to goe vp to the place, whereof our Lord hath spoken: for we haue sinned. <sup>41</sup> To whom Moyses said: Why transgresse you the word of our Lord, which shal not succede
