The most probable exposition seemeth to be gathered out of the Hebrewes A probable Tradition, that this Lamech of the issue of Cain (for there was an other La- sense accormech of Seths progenie) much addicted to hunting, and his eyes decaying, cling to the used to exercise the discretion of a yongue man his nephew, the sonne of Hebrewes Tubalcain. Who seing something moue in the bushes, supposing it to be a wild Tradition. beast, willed his grandfather to shoote at the same: which he did, and stroke the marke with a deadlie wound, and approching to take the pray, found it to be old Cain. Whereupon the auncient man, afflicted, and moued with great passion, did so beate the yongue man, for his il direction, that he also died of the drie blowes: After both which mishappes, and his passion at last calmed, Lamech lamented, as the text saith, that he had killed a man and stripling, to wit, the one with a wound, the other with drie blowes, for which he feared seuenfold punishment more then Cain suffered for killing Abel. Neuertheles S. Hierom & other Fathers thinke it probable, that Lamech killing the one of ignorance, the other in passion, was not so seuerly punished as he feared. And so they vnderstand the text of this passage, that seuenfold vengance was taken of Cain, by prolongation of his miserable life til his seuenth generation, when one of his owne issue slew him, and an other of the same linage with him. And Lamech was punished seuentie seuen fold when his seuentie seuen children (for so manie he had as Iosephus writeth) and al their ofspring perished in the floud. Mystically by seuentie seuen may be signified that the sinne of man- Mystical sense kind should be punished and expiated in Christ our Redeemer: who was borne in the seuentie seuenth generation from Adam.

26. *Began to inuocate.* Seth was a most holie man, and so brought vp his children, that they were called the sonnes of God. Gen. 6. Adam also and Eue were penitent, and became great confessors, and are now Sainctes. And so it can not be doubted but amongst other spiritual exercises they prayed and inuocated God. And therfore that which is here said: He (to wit Enos) began (as the Hebrew hath) *then was begune, to inuocate the name of our Lord*, can not be vnderstood of priuate, but of some publique prayer of manie meeting together, & obseruing some rites & set forme in peculiar place dedicated to diuine Seruice, the Church being now growne to a competent multitude. And that besides Sacrifice, which was also before, as appeareth both by Cain & Abel.[^1]
