<sup>17</sup> Returne to Balac and thus thou shalt speake to him. Returning he found him standing beside his holocauste, and the princes of the Moabites with him. To whom Balac said: What hath the Lord spoken? <sup>18</sup> But he taking vp his parable, said: Stand Balac, and harken, heare thou sonne of Sephor: <sup>19</sup> God is not as man, that he may lie, nor as the sonne of man, that he may be changed. Hath he said then, and wil he not doe? hath he spoken, and wil he not fulfil? <sup>20</sup> I was brought to blesse, the blessing I am not able to stay. <sup>21</sup> There is no Idol in Iacob, neither is there a simulachre to be seene in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the victorie of the king in him. <sup>22</sup> God hath brought him out of Ã†gypt, whose strength is like to the vnicorne. <sup>23</sup> There is no Southsaying in Iacob, nor diuination in Israel. In their times it shal be said to Iacob and Israel what God hath wrought. <sup>24</sup> Behold the people shal rise vp as a lionesse, and as a lion shal raise it self: It shal not lie downe til it deuoure the pray, and drinke the bloud of the slaine. <sup>25</sup> And Balac said to Balaam: neither curse, nor blesse him. <sup>26</sup> And he said: Did I not tel thee, that whatsoeuer God should command me, that would I doe? <sup>27</sup> And Balac said to him: Come, and I wil bring thee to an other place: if happely it please God that thence thou mayest curse them. <sup>28</sup> And when he had brought him vpon the toppe of the mountaine Phogor, which looketh to the wildernesse, <sup>29</sup> Balaam said to him: Build me here seuen altares, and prepare as manie calues, and rammes of the same number. <sup>30</sup> Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laide the calues and the rammes on euerie altar.

CHAP. XXIIII.

*Balaam forced by the euidence of truth (though not conuerted in wil to serue God, whom he confesseth to be omnipotent) prophecieth stil more good of Israel: 10. Wherefore Balac interrupteth him, and he answereth plainly that God almightie wil haue it so. 15. And so proceeding he prophecieth of CHRIST. 20. Also of Amalekites, Cinites, and Italians.*

AND when Balaam had seene that it pleased our Lord <sup>1</sup> that he should blesse Israel, he went not as before he had gone, to seeke Southsaying: but directing his countenance against the desert, <sup>2</sup> and lifting vp his eies, he saw Israel abiding in their tentes by their tribes: and the spirit of God
