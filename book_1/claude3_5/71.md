<aside>The fifth part of this booke. Of Abrahams leauing his countrie, Gods blessing of his seede, & commandment of Circumcision.</aside>

Abram commanded by God to leaue his countrie, with promise to be blessed in his seede, 5. taking his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot, 6. wandreth in the land of Chanaan, 7. erecteth an Altar in Sichem, 8. an other in Bethel. 10. Thence by occasion of famine passeth into Ægypt. 14. where his wife (called his sister) is taken into the kings house, 19. but vntouched is restored to him.

<sup>1</sup> And our Lord said to Abram: Goe forth of thy countrie, and out of thy kinred, and out of thy fathers house, and come into a land, which I wil shew thee. <sup>2</sup> And I wil make thee into a great nation, and I wil blesse thee, and magnifie thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. <sup>3</sup> I wil blesse them and blesse thee, and cursse them that cursse thee, and IN THEE shal al the kindreds of the earth be blessed. <sup>4</sup> Abram therfore went out as our Lord had commanded him, and with him went Lot: seuentie fiue yeares old was Abram when he went forth out of Haran. <sup>5</sup> And he tooke Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers sonne, and al the substance which they had possessed, and the soules which they had gotten in Haran: and went forth to goe into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it, <sup>6</sup> Abram passed through the countrie vnto the place Sichem, as farre as the noble vale: and the Cananite was at that time in the countrie. <sup>7</sup> And our Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed wil I giue this land. Who builded there an altar to our Lord, that had appeared to him. <sup>8</sup> And marching on from thence to a mountaine, that was on the east side of Bethel, there he pitched his tent, hauing Bethel on the west, and Hay on the east: he builded there also an altar to our Lord, and called vpon his name. <sup>9</sup> And Abram went forward going, and proceding on to the South. <sup>10</sup> And there came a famine in the countrie: and Abram descended into Ægypt, to be as a pilgrime there: for the famine was very sore in the land. <sup>11</sup> And when he was nere to enter into Ægypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a fayre woman: <sup>12</sup> and that when the Ægyptians shal see thee,
