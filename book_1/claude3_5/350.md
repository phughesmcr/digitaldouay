the priest, to whose charge perteyneth the oyle to dresse the
lampes, and the incense of composition, and the sacrifice,
that is alwayes offered, and the oyle of vnction, and what-
soeuer perteyneth to the seruice of the tabernacle, and of al
the vessel, that are in the Sanctuarie. <sup>17</sup> And our Lord spake
vnto Moyses and Aaron, saying: <sup>18</sup> Destroy not the people
of Caath out of the middes of the Leuites: <sup>19</sup> but doe this to
them, that they may liue, and not die, if they touch Sancta
sanctorum. Aaron and his sonnes shal enter, and they shal
dispose the charges of euerie one, and shal diuide what euerie
one must carie. <sup>20</sup> Let others by no curiositie see the thinges
that are in the Sanctuarie before they be wrapped vp, other-
wise they shal die. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying:
<sup>22</sup> Take the summe of the sonnes of Gerson also by their
houses and families and kinredes, <sup>23</sup> from thirtie yeares and
vpward, vnto fiftie yeares. Number them al that goe in and
minister in the tabernacle of couenant. <sup>24</sup> This is the office
of the familie of the Gersonites, <sup>25</sup> for to carie the curtines
of the tabernacle, and the roofe of the couenant the other
couer, and ouer al the ianthine couer, and the hanging that
hangeth in the entrie of the tabernacle of couenant, <sup>26</sup> the
curtines of the court, and the veile in the entrie that is be-
fore the tabernacle. Al thinges that pertayne to the altar, the
cordes, and vessel of the ministerie, <sup>27</sup> shal the sonnes of
Gerson carie, by the commandment of Aaron & his sonnes:
and euerie one shal knowe to what burden they must be
assigned. <sup>28</sup> This is the seruice of the familie of the Gersonites
in the tabernacle of couenant, and they shal be vnder the
hand of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the priest. <sup>29</sup> The
sonnes of Merari also by the families and houses of their
fathers thou shalt recken, <sup>30</sup> from thirtie yeares and vpward,
vntil fiftie yeares, al that enter in to the office of their mi-
nisterie, and to the seruice of the couenant of testimonie.
<sup>31</sup> These are their burdens: They shal carie the bordes of
the tabernacle and the barres therof, the pillers and the
feete of them, <sup>32</sup> the pillers also of the court round about,
with their feete and pinnes and cordes. Al the vessel and im-
plementes they shal receiue by account, and so shal carie
them. <sup>33</sup> This is the office of the familie of the Merarites, and
their ministerie in the tabernacle of couenant: and they shal
be vnder the hand of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the priest.
