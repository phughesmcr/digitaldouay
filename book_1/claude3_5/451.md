<sup>9</sup> Seven weeks shalt thou number thee from that day wherein thou didst put the sickle to the corne, <sup>10</sup> and thou shalt celebrate the festival day of weekes to our Lord thy God, a voluntarie oblation of thy hand, which thou shalt offer according to the blessing of our Lord thy God: <sup>11</sup> and thou shalt feast before our Lord thy God, thou, & thy sonne, and thy daughter, and thy man servant, and thy woman servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger and pupil and widow, which abide with you: in the place which our Lord thy God shal choose, that his name may dwel there: <sup>12</sup> and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in Aegypt: and thou shalt keepe and doe the thinges that are commanded. <sup>13</sup> The solemnitie also of Tabernacles thou shalt celebrate seven daies, when thou hast gathered thy fruites of the barne floore and the presse: <sup>14</sup> and thou shalt feast in the festivitie, thou, thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man servant and woman servant, the Levite also and stranger, and pupil and widow that are within thy gates. <sup>15</sup> Seven daies shalt thou celebrate the feastes to our Lord thy God in the place, which our Lord shal choose: and our Lord thy God wil blesse thee in al thy fruites, and in everie worke of thy handes, and thou shalt be in joye. <sup>16</sup> Three times in a yeare shal al thy male appeare in the sight of our Lord thy God in the place which he shal choose: in the solemnitie of Azymes, in the solemnitie of weekes, and in the solemnitie of Tabernacles. There shal not appeare before our Lord any emptie: <sup>17</sup> but everie one shal offer according to that he hath, according to the blessing of our Lord his God, which he shal geve him. <sup>18</sup> Iudges and maisters shalt thou appoynt in al thy gates, which our Lord thy God shal geve thee, in everie of thy tribes: that they may judge the people with just judgement, <sup>19</sup> and not decline to either part. Thou shalt not accept person, nor giftes: because giftes blinde the eies of the wise, and change the wordes of the just. <sup>20</sup> Iustly shalt thou pursue that which is just: that thou mayest live and possesse the Land, which our Lord thy God shal geve thee. <sup>21</sup> Thou shalt plante no grove, nor any tree neere the altar of our Lord thy God. <sup>22</sup> Neither shalt thou make nor sette to thy self a statue: which thing our Lord thy God hateth.
