CHAP. V.

*Moyses and Aaron require of Pharao in the behalfe of God, to let his people
the Hebrewes goe and sacrifice in the desert. VVhich he contemning, 5. op-
presseth them more, denying them straw, and yet exacting the accustomed
number of brickes. 10. The people oppressed impute their miserie to Moyses
and Aaron. 22. But Moyses prayeth to God for them.*

1 AFTER these things Moyses and Aaron went in, and
said to Pharao : Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:
dismisse my people that they may sacrifice to me in the desert. <sup>2</sup> But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should
heare his voice, and dismisse Israel? I know not the Lord,
3 and Israel I wil not dismisse. <sup>3</sup> And they said : The God of
the Hebrewes hath called vs, to goe three daies iourney into
the wildernesse, and to sacrifice to the Lord our God : lest
4 perhappes there chance to vs pestilence or sword. <sup>4</sup> The
king of Ã†gypt said to them: Why do you Moyses and Aaron
solicite the people from their workes? Goe you to your
5 burdens. <sup>5</sup> And Pharao said: The people of the land is much:
you see that the multitude is secretely increased: how much
6 more if you geue them rest from their workes? <sup>6</sup> Therefore
he commanded in that day the ouerseers of the workes and
7 the exactores of the people, saying: <sup>7</sup> You shal no more
geue straw to the people for to make brickes, as before: but
8 let them selues goe and geather straw. <sup>8</sup> And the taske of
brickes, which they did before, you shal put vpon them,
neither shal you diminish any thing: for they are idle, and
therefore they crie, saying: Let vs goe, and sacrifice to our
9 God. <sup>9</sup> Let them be oppressed with workes, and let them
accomplish them: that they hearken not to lying wordes.
10 <sup>10</sup> Therefore the ouerseers of the workes and the exactors
going forth said vnto the people: Thus saith Pharao: I allow
11 you no straw: <sup>11</sup> goe, and geather if you can find any where:
