At the commandment of our Lord they pitched their tentes, and at his commandement they tooke them downe. <sup>21</sup> If the cloude had bene from euen vntil morning, and immediatly at day breake had forsaken the tabernacle, they marched: and if it had departed after a day and a night, they tooke downe their tentes. <sup>22</sup> But if for two daies or one moneth or a longer time it had bene ouer the tabernacle, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as it had departed, they remoued the campe. <sup>23</sup> By the word of the Lord they pitched their tentes, and by his word they marched: and were in the watches of our Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moyses.
