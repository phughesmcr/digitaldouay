# To the English Reader,

led in vs: yet our tribulation, which presently is momen-
tanie, and light, worketh (*through grace*) aboue measure
excedingly an eternal weight of glorie. What shal we
therfore meditate of the especial prerogatiue of English
Catholiques at this time? For to you it is geuen for Christ,
not only that you beleue in him, but also that you suffer for
him. A litle now, if you must be made pensiue in diuers
tentations, that the probation of your faith, much more
precious then gold, which is proued by the fire, may be
found vnto praise, and glorie, and honour, in the reuelati-
on of Iesus Christ. Manie of you haue susteyncd the spoile
of your goodes with ioy, knowing that you haue a better
and a permanent substance. Others haue benne depriued
of your children, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and
nerest frendes, in readie resolution also, some with sentence
of death, to lose your owne liues. Others haue had trial
of reproches, mockeries, and stripes. Others of bandes,
prisons, and banishmentes. The innumerable renowned
late English Martyres, & Confessors, whose happie soules
for confessing true faith before men, are now most glo-
rious in heauen, we passe here with silence; because their
due praise, requiring longer discourse, yea rather Angels,
then English tongues, farre surpasseth the reach of our con-
ceiptes. And so we leaue it to your deuout meditation.
They now secure for themselues, and solicitous for vs their
dearest clientes, incessantly (we are wel assured) intercede
before Christs Diuine Maiestie, for our happie consum-
mation, with the conuersion of our whole countrie. To
you therfore (dearest frendes mortal) we direct this speach:
admonishing ourselues & you, in the Apostles wordes, that
for so much as we haue not yet resisted tentations to (last)
bloud (and death it self) patience is stil necessarie for vs,
that doing the wil of God, we may receiue the promise. So
we repine not in tribulation, but euer loue them that hate
vs, pittying their case, and reioyceing in our owne. For
