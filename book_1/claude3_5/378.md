ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XVI.

[^1] *Rise against Moyses.*] By this most famous Schisme and terrible punish­ment therof, al are warned to kepe order, vnitie, and peace within the Church of God; and in no wise to communicate with heretikes, or schismatikes in the act of heresie or schisme. A necessarie admonition especially in such times and places as we liue in, and see greater breaches made from ordinarie and lawful Pastors, then thi was. For as S. Ignatius wel noteth (*epist. 3. ad Magnasianos*) Core Dathan and Abiron impugned not directly the law, but resisted Moyses and Aaron: Yet were they and manie thousands with them, seuerely punished for their conspiracie. S. Cyprian (*lib. 1. Epist. 6.*) obserueth the same, saying: Core Dathan and Abiron acknowledged the same God with Aaron and Moy­ses, liuing vnder the same law and religion, and inuocated one true God, yet because, passing the appointed ministerie of their owne place, opposite to Aaron (who by Gods fauour and ordinance had receiued lawful Priesthood) they tooke vpon them to sacrifice, they were forthwith punished by God for their vnlawful attempts: neither could their sacrifices irreligiously and vnlawfully offered against Gods ordinance be ratified, nor profite them at al, thus rea­cheth S. Cyprian the glorious Martyr. And the text is clere, that they were neither Idolaters nor Heretikes, but the chiefe of them being Leuites, of the familie of Caath, (who were nerest in kinred, and in office to the priests) and other principal men of diuers tribes, enuying the superioritie of Moyses and Aaron, and that priesthood was established only in Aarons progenie, arroga­ted to themselues the office of Priests and offered incense, further pretending, for vpholding their schisme, that there should be no Superior at al aboue the holie people of God, which albeit they did not beleeue, yet therby they drew the multitude to fauour and folow them. But God deciding this debate, to take away the contradiction, made the earth to open, and swallow vp those that first refused to obey Moyses, with their tabernacles and substance; and fire from heauen to consume two hundred and fiftie which offered incense; and fourtene thousand seuen hundred of the common people, for imputing to their Supe­riors the destruction of the sedicious, were also consumed with fire, raging a­mongst the whole multitude, til Aaron sent by Moyses, and offering incense
