fraude, he would haue obteined, whole, and the fift part
besides to the owner vnto whom he did the damage. <sup>6</sup> But
for his sinne he shal offer a ramme without spott out of the
flocke, and shal geue it to the priest, according to the esti-
mation, and measure of the offence: <sup>7</sup> who shal pray for
him before the Lord, and he shal haue forgeuenes for euerie
thing that in doing he sinned. <sup>8</sup> And Our Lord spake to
Moyses, saying: <sup>9</sup> Command Aaron and his sonnes: This is
the Law of an holocaust: It shal be burnt vpon the altar, al
night vntil morning: the fire shal be vpon the same altar.
<sup>10</sup> The priest shal be reuested with the tunike and the linnen
femorales: and he shal take vp the ashes, which the deuou-
ring fire burned, and putting them besides the altar, <sup>11</sup> shal
be vnuested of his former vestiments, and being clothed with
others, shal carie them forth without the campe, and in a
most cleane place shal cause them to be consumed vnto dust.
<sup>12</sup> And the fire on the altar shal alwaies burne, which the
priest shal nourish, putting wood vnderneth, in the mor-
ning euerie day, and laying on the holocausts, therupon shal
burne the fatte of the pacifiques. <sup>13</sup> This fire is continual
which shal neuer faile on the altar. <sup>14</sup> This is the Law of the
sacrifice and libamentes, which the children of Aaron shal
offer before the Lord, and before the altar. <sup>15</sup> The priest shal
take vp a handful of the floure, that is tempered with oyle,
and al the frankincense, that is put vpon the floure: and he
shal burne it on the altar for a moniment of most sweete-
odour to the Lord: <sup>16</sup> and the part of the floure that is left,
shal Aaron eate with his sonnes, without leauen: and he shal
eate it in the Holie place of the court of the tabernacle.
<sup>17</sup> And therefore it shal not be leauened, because part thereof
is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. It shal be most
Holie, as that for sinne, and for offence. <sup>18</sup> The males
onlie of Aarons stocke shal eate it. It shal be an ordinance
euerlasting in your generations of the sacrifices of the
Lord. Euerie one that toucheth them, shal be sanctified. <sup>19</sup> And
our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>20</sup> This is the oblation of
Aaron, and of his sonnes, which they must offer to the Lord,
in the day of their vnction. The tenth part of an ephi of
floure shal they offer in a sacrifice for euer, halfe thereof in the
morning, and halfe therof at euen: <sup>21</sup> which being tempered
with oile shal be fried in a frying panne. <sup>22</sup> And the priest
