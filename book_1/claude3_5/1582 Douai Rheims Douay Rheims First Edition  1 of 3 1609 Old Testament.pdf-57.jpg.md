<sup>16</sup>Goe forth of the arke, thou & thy wife, thy sonnes and the

of al flesh, as wel in foules, as in beastes, & al creepers, that
creepe vpon the earth, bring out with thee, & goe yee vpon
the earth: increase and multiplie vpon it. <sup>18</sup>Noe therfore
went forth, and his sonnes: his wife, and the wiues of his

that crepe vpon the earth, according to their kinde, went
<sup>20</sup>forth out of the arke. <sup>20</sup>And Noe built an Altar to our Lord:
and taking of al cattle and foules that were cleane, offered

sauour, and said: I wil no more curse the earth for men: for
the sense and cogitation of mans hart are prone to euil from
their youth: I wil no more therfore strike euerie liuing

20. *Built an Altar*] Noe without expresse commandment, and without
delay, offered Sacrifice to God, for the benefite receiued, in his, and his families conseruation, with the other liuing creatures, in that general deluge of
the world. *Vvel knowing* (saith S. Ambrose) *that to be true thankesgeuing, which
is presented, not commanded: therfore he made an Altar, for the vertue of a grateful
mind excludeth doubtful deliberation, and the that expecteth til he be bidden to do
his dutie, is vngratefull person*. For more solemnities, he dedicated an apt and
permanent place for this peculiar diuine seruice, *building an Altar to our Lord*.
The Hebrew word *Mizbeach* (of the verbe *Zabach*, to kil, or make sacrifice)
and the Greeke *thysiastirion*, signifie an Altar to sacrifice on, not a common
table for meate. He offered *of the cleane and best things*: because pure and
deuout Sacrifice is due to God. Moreouer it was large and bountiful, for he
offered of al the kindes of cleane beastes and foules. Finally he offered them
in *Holocauste*, where al was burned and consumed in the honour of God. How
grateful al this was to God, Moyses signifieth saying: *Our Lord smelled a sweete
sauour*, not that either smoke or sweete corporal sauour could of it selfe delight
God, who is the most spiritual substance, or that the burning of flesh, bones,
and bowels of beastes could yeeld sweete sauour: but the deuout mind decla-
red by such external dutie greatly pleased God. For God requireth both, but
specially a sincere hart. As not only diuine Scriptures, and holie Fathers, but
also moral Philosophers teach vs. *It were a great thing* (saith Plato writing
of sacrifices) *if God respected rather the gift, and sacrifices of men, then their
mind*. *lib. pertes prosenches*.
