<sup>10</sup> coaftes, which our Lord gaue them: Who being wrath
<sup>11</sup> sware, laying: If these men, that came vp out of Aegypt,
from twentie yeares and vpward, shal see the land, which
vnder othe I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: and
<sup>12</sup> they would not folow me, except Caleb the sonne of Ie-
phone the Cenezeite, and Iosue the sonne of Nun: these
<sup>13</sup> haue fulfilled my wil. And our Lord being wrath agaynst
Israel, led him about through the desert fourtie yeares, vntil
the whole generation was consumed, that had done euil in
<sup>14</sup> his sight. And behold, quoth he, you are risen vp in steed
of your fathers, the offspring and disciples of sinful men,
<sup>15</sup> to augment the furie of our Lord agaynst Israel. But if
you wil not folow him, he wil leaue the people in the wil-
<sup>16</sup> dernesse, and you shal be the cause of the death of al. But
they coming nere, said: We wil make sheepcotes, and stal-
<sup>17</sup> les for our cattel, for our litle ones also fensed cities: and
we our selues armed and girded wil march on to battle be-
fore the children of Israel, vntil we bring them in vnto their
places. Our litle ones and whatsoeuer we can haue, shal be
in walled cities, because of the lying of wayte of the inhabi-
<sup>18</sup> tantes. We wil not returne into our houses, vntil the chil-
<sup>19</sup> dren of Israel possesse their inheritance: neither wil we
seeke any thing beyound Iordan, because already we haue
<sup>20</sup> our possession on the east side therof. To whom Moyses
said: If you doe that you promisse, march on wel appointed
<sup>21</sup> before our Lord to fight: and let euerie man of warre
<sup>22</sup> passe ouer Iordan, vntil our Lord subuert his enemies, and
al the Land be subdued to him: then shal you be blamelesse
before our Lord and before Israel, and you shal obteyne the
<sup>23</sup> countries that you would in the sight of our Lord. But
if you doe not, that which you say, no man can doubt but
you sinne against God: and know ye that your sinne shal ap-
<sup>24</sup> prehend you. Build therfore cities for your litle ones,
and sheepcotes and stalles for your sheepe and cattel: and
<sup>25</sup> accomplish that which you haue promised. And the chil-
dren of Gad and Ruben said to Moyses: We are thy seruan-
<sup>26</sup> tes, we wil do that which our lord commandeth. We wil
leaue our litle ones, and our wiues, and sheepe, and cattel in
<sup>27</sup> the cities of Galaad: and we thy seruantes al wel appoyn-
ted wil march on to the warre, as thou my lord speakest.
<sup>28</sup> Moyses therfore commanded Eleazar the priest, and Iosue
