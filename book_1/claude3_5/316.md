<sup>6</sup> And the priest shal poure the bloud vpon the altar of our Lord, at the dore of the tabernacle of testimonie, and shal burne the fatte for a swete odour to our Lord: <sup>7</sup> and they shal no more immolate their hostes to diuels, with whom they haue committed fornication. It shal be an ordinance for euer to them and to their posteritie. <sup>8</sup> And to them thou shalt say: The man of the house of Israel, and of the strangers, which seiourne with you, that offereth an holocaust or victime, <sup>9</sup> and bringeth it not to the dore of the tabernacle of testimonie, that it may be offered to our Lord, shal perish out of his people. <sup>10</sup> Anie man whosoeuer of the house of Israel, and of the strangers, that seiourne among them, if he eate bloud, I wil sette my face against his life, and wil destroy it out of his people, <sup>11</sup> because the life of the flesh is in the bloud: and I haue geuen it to you, that vpon the altar you may make expiation with it for your soules, and the bloud may be for an expiation of the soule. <sup>12</sup> Therfore haue I said to the children of Israel: No soule of you shal eate bloud, nor of the strangers, that seiourne with you. <sup>13</sup> Anie man whosoeuer of the children of Israel, and of the strangers that seiourne with you, if by hunting or fowling, he take wild beast or foule, which it is lawful to eate, let him poure out the bloud therof, and couer it with earth. <sup>14</sup> For the life of al flesh is in the bloud: wherupon I said to the children of Israel: The bloud of no flesh shal you eate, because the life of the flesh is in the bloud: and whosoeuer eateth it, shal die. <sup>15</sup> The soule that eateth carraine, or that which is taken of a beast, aswel of them of the same countrie as of strangers, shal wash his clothes, and him self with water, and shal be contaminated vntil euen: and in this order he shal be made cleane. <sup>16</sup> And if he doe not wash his clothes, and his bodie, he shal beare his iniquitie.
