<sup>2</sup>I wil geue you, thou shalt sabbatize the sabbath to the Lord. Six yeares thou shalt sowe thy field, and six yeares thou shalt cut thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruites thereof: <sup>4</sup>but in the seuenth yeare a sabbath shal be to the earth, of the resting of the Lord: the field thou shalt not sowe, and the vineyard thou shalt not cut. <sup>5</sup>The thinges that the ground shal bring forth of it self, thou shalt not reape: and the grapes of thy first fruites thou shalt not gather as a vintage: for it is a yeare of the resting of the earth: <sup>6</sup>but they shal be vnto you for meate, to thee and thy manseruant, to thy woman seruant and hyreling, and to the stranger that seiourneth with thee: <sup>7</sup>to thy beastes and cattel al thin-ges that grow shal giue meate. <sup>8</sup>Thou shalt number thee also seuen weekes of yeares: that is to say, seuen times seuen, which together make fourtie nine yea-res: <sup>9</sup>and thou shalt sound with the trumpet the se-uenth moneth, the tenth day of the moneth, in the time of propitiation in al your land. <sup>10</sup>Thou shalt sanctifie the fifteth yeare, and shalt proclame remission to al the inhabitantes of thy land: for it is the yeare of Iubilie.
