of testimonie, and al the vessel thereof, and whatsoeuer per-
taineth to the ceremonies. They shal carie the tabernacle
and al the furniture therof: and they shal be in the ministerie,
and shal pitch round about the tabernacle. <sup>52</sup> When you
are to goe forward, the Leuites shal take downe the ta-
bernacle: when you are to campe, they shal set it vp. what
:: stranger soeuer cometh to it, he shal be slaine. <sup>53</sup> And the
children of Israel shal campe euerie man by his troupes and
bands and hoste. <sup>54</sup> Moreouer the Leuites shal pitch their
tents round about the tabernacle, lest there come indigna-
tion vpon the multitude of the children of Israel, and they
shal watch in the custodies of the tabernacle of testimonie.
<sup>55</sup> The children of Israel therfore did according to al things
which our Lord had commanded Moyses.
