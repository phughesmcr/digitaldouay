Pasch.

S. Cyprian: (de Cæna Dom.) saith: In the supper of sacramental banquets, old and new Institutions met together. The lambe being consumed, which old tradition proposed, the Master setteth incorruptible meate to his disciples. S. Gregorie Nazianzem (Orat 2. de Pascha) saith, God commanded the Paschal lambe should be eaten in the euening, because Christ in the euening gaue the Sacrament of his owne bodie to his disciples. S. Hierom (in 26. Mat.) After that the figuratiue Pasch was complete, and Christ had eaten the flesh of the lambe with his Apostles, he taketh bread, <sup>105</sup>which confirmeth the hart of man, and passeth ouer to the true Sacrament of Pasch. Likewise S. Chrisostom (Ho. de prodit. Iudæ) saith, In the same table both the Pasches, of the figure, and of the veritie were celebrated. S. Ambrose (in Luca. 1.) expressly applieth this figuratiue lambe to the Eucharist, as it is celebrated in the Church, by him self and other Priestes, saying: When we sacrifice, Christ is present, Christ is sacrificed: for Christ our Pasch is immolated. The like affirmeth S. Augustin (li. 3. cont. lit. Petil. c. 37.) It is an other Pasch that the Iewes celebrated of a sheepe, an other which we receiue in the bodie and bloud of our Lord. S. Leo (ser. 7. de Paſſ.) To the end shadowes might geue place to the bodie, and figures might cease in presence of the veritie, the old obseruation is taken away by the new Sacrament, hoste passeth into hoste, bloud excludeth bloud, and when the legal festiuitie is changed, it is fulfilled.

S. Gregorie (to 22 in Euan:) proueth by these wordes, You shal not eate therof anie thing raw, that besides the letter there is a spiritual sense. Behold, saith he, the verie wordes of the historie driue vs from the historical vnderstanding. For did the Israelitical people in Ægypt vse to eate a lambe raw, that the law should nede to say: you shal not eate it raw? And so in that homilie this great Doctor explicateth how we ought to celebrate, and receiue the Sacrament of the Eucharist, by the figure of this Paschal lambe: This bloud (saith he) is sprinkled on both postes, when the Sacrament of his Passion is receiued with mouth, to redemption, and meditated with intentiue mind to imitation, and in th. train our outer dore, when pure intention directeth the exterior act; also when we carie the Crosse of his passion in our forhead. The flesh of the lambe is eaten at night, because we now receiue our Lords bodie in the Sacrament, when yet we see not ech others consciences. rosted at the fire, when we ioyne to our beleefe good workes of feruent charitie: with vnleuened bread, and wilde lettice, that is, in sinceritie, with out corruption of vaineglorie, and with bitter penance for sinnes: not raw, nor sodde in water, to wit, neither esteeming Christ a mere man, nor considering of him, with humane wisdome or priuate spirite of heretikes, called false water: prou 9. To deuoure the head with the feete an inwards, is by faith to beleue the Diuinitie of Christ, and to imitate by loue the steppes of his humanitie, and greedely to learne al Christian mysteries. Nothing is left til morning, when we endeuoure in this life before the resurrection to know euerie point of christian doctrin, so farre as to vs pertaineth. But if anie thing be left, it must be burned in the fire, because such high mysteries, which we can not vnderstand, we must remitte to the Holie Ghost, lest anie proudly presume either to contemne, or to proclaime that he vnderstandeth not: He further describeth also what maner of persons are to eate this new Pasch: Their loines must be girded, that is, al carnal pleasures tamed. They must haue shoes on their feete, by the good examples of former Sainctes dead before, must strengthen their steppes, to stie from vice, and follow vertue: holding staues in their handes, to rule & stay themselues and others from falling, by the stiffe of authoritie. They must eate the Pasch speedely, that is without delay or procrastination must learne the mysteries of mans redemption, and
