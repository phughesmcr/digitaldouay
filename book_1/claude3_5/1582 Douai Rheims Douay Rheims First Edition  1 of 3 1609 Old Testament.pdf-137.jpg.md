cesterne: and we wil say A naughtie wild beast hath deuoured him: <sup>21</sup>and then it shal appeare what his dreames doe profite him. <sup>21</sup>And Ruben hearing this, endeuored to deliuer him out of their hands, and said: <sup>22</sup>Do not take away his life, neyther shed ye blood: but cast him into this cesterne, that is in the wildernesse, and keepe your handes harmeles: and he said this, desirous to deliuer him out of their handes, and to restore him to his father. <sup>23</sup>As soone therefore as he came vnto his brethren, forthwith they stripped him out of his side coate, and of diuers colours, <sup>24</sup>And cast him into the old cesterne, that had not water. <sup>25</sup>And sitting to eate bread, they saw Ismaelites wayfaring men coming from Galaad, and their camels carying spices, and rosen, and mirrh into Ægypt. <sup>26</sup>Iudas therefore said to his brethren: What auaileth it vs if we kil our brother, <sup>27</sup>and conceale his bloode? It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our handes be not polluted: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren assented to his wordes. <sup>28</sup>And when the Madianite marchants passed by, they drawing him out of the cesterne, sold him to the Ismaelites, for twentie peeces of siluer, who brought him into Ægypt. <sup>29</sup>And Ruben returning to the cesterne, findeth not the boy: <sup>30</sup>and renting his garments went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appeare, and whither shal I goe? <sup>31</sup>And they tooke his coate, and dipped it in the blood of a kidde, which they had killed: <sup>32</sup>sending some that should carie it to their father, and should say: This we haue founde: see whether it be thy sonnes coate, or no. <sup>33</sup>Which when the father acknowledged, he said: It is my sonnes coate, a naughtie wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath deuoured Ioseph. <sup>34</sup>And tearing his garments, did on sackcloth, mourning his sonne a great time. <sup>35</sup>And al his children being gethered together to asswage their fathers sorowe, he would not take comforte, but said: I wil descend vnto my sonne "into hel, mourning. <sup>36</sup>And whilest he perseured in weeping, the Madianites sold Ioseph in Ægypt to Phutiphar an Eunuch of Pharaos maister of the souldiers.
