to thy mistresse, and humble thy selfe vnder her hand. <sup>10</sup>And again: Multiplying, sayth he, wil I multiplie thy seed, and it shal not be numbred for the multitude therof. <sup>11</sup>And again: after that: Behold, faith he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a sonne: and thou shalt cal his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thin affliction. <sup>12</sup>He shal be a wild man: his hand shal be against al men, and al mens hands against him: and ouer against al his bretheren shal he pitch his tents. <sup>13</sup>And she called the name of our Lord that spake vnto her: Thou the God which hast sene me. For she said: verily here haue I sene the backe partes of him that hath sene me. <sup>14</sup>Therefore she called that wel, the Wel of him that liueth and seeth me.

CHAP. XVI.

<aside>Manichees, condemned pluralitie of wiues in the Patriarches. Luther alloweth it in Christians. Other Protestants in some case.</aside>

[^1] The Manichees did calumniat holie Abraham, and other Patriarches for hauing manie wiues, condemning them of incontinencie and adulterie for the same. Luther in his contrarie extreme held it not vnlawful, but indifferent, now in the law of grace, for a man to haue more wiues then one: And some English Protestants hold, that for adulterie, the innocent partie may marie an other, the first liuing. But the Catholique doctrine distinguishing times and causes, sheweth how pluralitie of wiues was lawful sometimes, and at other times, especially since Christ, altogether vnlawful, and vndispensable. The summe of which veritie is this. By the first institution of Mariage in the state of innocencie, and law of nature, and by the law of Christ, it is vnlawful for anie man to haue more wiues, and for anie woman to haue more husbands, then one. In the state of which Law notwithstanding God sometimes dispensed. For there be two kindes of preceptes in the law of nature. One from the first principles of the law of nature, in which God neuer dispenseth, much lesse anie man. As that one woman may not haue more husbands then one, because the same would rather hinder procreation, and for other directly against the fruite of mariage. The other sorte are as conclusions drawne from the first principles, in which God sometimes dispenseth, but neuer anie man. As in this present example: seeing it is against natural procreation that one woman should haue manie husbands, it conuenient also, there being ordinarily as manie men as women in the world, that euerie man likewise should be restrained to one wife, for so procreation may rather be increased, then if some men haue manie wiues, and others by that occasion haue none at al, except in some special case. As after the floud, when there was scarsitie of people, God dispensed with such men as in deede were like to make greater procreation by pluralitie of wiues. Which appe-
