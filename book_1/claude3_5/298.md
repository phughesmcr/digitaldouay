# Leviticus

<aside>Al three kindes of sacrifice offered at the consecration of Priests.</aside>

<aside>Priesthood and Law changed together.</aside>

<aside>The Sacrament of holie Orders prefigured, and the new Law.</aside>

14\. *He offered likewise*] Other thinges which Moyses was here commanded to take, at the consecration of Priests, were a calfe, to be offered in sacrifice for sinne; two rammes, the one in holocauft, the other in pacifique sacrifice, for the consecration of Priests; and a basket of vnleuened bread, to be offered with the two rammes. Al for the greater solemnitie of this Sacrament of Orders. By which Aaron and his sonnes were made the lawful and ordinarie Priests of the law newly deliuered by Moyses. And so Priesthood was changed from the first borne of euerie familie, and established only in Aaron and his sonnes, and their issue male, to be in like sorte consecrated. And the rest of the Leuites to assist them. By this also was prefigured the Sacrament of holie Orders in the Church of Christ, with an other change of Priesthood from the familie & order of Aaron, to Priestes of the new Testament, of what familie or nation soeuer. And withal an other change of the law. *For the Priesthood being translated, it is necessarie (saith S. Paul) that a translation of the Law be also made*. And this Sacrament in deede geueth grace (as by the other it was only signified) to those that are rightly ordered. As the same Apostle testifieth, willing Timothie *to resuscitate the grace geuen him by imposition of handes*. 1. Timot. 1.

AND when the eight day was come, Moyses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the ancients of Israel, and said to Aaron: <sup>1</sup> Take of the heard :: a calfe for sinne, and a ramme for an holocauft, both without spot, and offer them before our Lord. <sup>2</sup> And to the children of Israel thou shalt speake: Take ye a bucke goate for sinne, and a calfe, and a lambe, of a yeare old, & without spot for an holocauft, <sup>3</sup> an oxe and a ramme for pacifiques: and immolate them before our Lord, offering in the sacrifice of euerie one, flowre tempered with oile; for to day our Lord wil appeare to you. <sup>4</sup> They tooke therfore al thinges that Moyses had comanded before the dore of the tabernacle: where when al the multitude stood, <sup>5</sup> Moyses said: This is the word, which our Lord hath commanded: doe it, :: and his glorie wil appeare to you. <sup>6</sup> And he said to Aaron: Approch to the altar, & immolate for thy sinne: offer the holocaust, and pray for thy self and for the people, and when thou hast slaine the peoples hoste, pray for them, as our Lord hath comanded. <sup>7</sup> And forthwith Aaron approaching to the altar, immolated the calfe for his sinne: <sup>8</sup> the bloud whereof his sonnes brought to him: wherin dip-
