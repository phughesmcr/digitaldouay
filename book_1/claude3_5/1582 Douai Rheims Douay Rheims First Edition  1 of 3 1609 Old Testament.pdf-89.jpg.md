GENESIS.

<sup>1</sup>And the two angels came to Sodome at euen; and Lot sitting in the gates of the citie. Who when he had sene them, rose vp and went to meete them: and adored prostrate vnto the ground, <sup>2</sup>and said: I beseech you, my Lords, turne in into the house of your seruant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in the morning you shal go forth on your way. Who said: No, but we wil abide in the street. <sup>3</sup>He compelled them earnestly to turne in vnto him: and when they were entred into his house, he made them a banquet, and baked vnleauened bread, and they did eate. <sup>4</sup>And before they went to bed, the men of the citie beset the house from young to old, al the people together. <sup>5</sup>And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? bring them forth hither that we may know them. <sup>6</sup>Lot going forth to them, and shutting the dore after him, said: <sup>7</sup>Doe not so, I besech you, my brethren, doe not commit this euil. <sup>8</sup>I haue two daughters, which as yet haue not knowen man: I wil bring them forth to you, and abuse you them as it shal please you, so that you do no euil to these men, because they are entred vnder the shadowe of my roose. <sup>9</sup>But they said: Get thee backe thither.

And they did violence to Lot excedingly: and it was euen nowe at the point that they would breake the dores. <sup>10</sup>And behold the men put forth their hand, and drew in Lot vnto them, and shut the dore: <sup>11</sup>and them, that were without, they stroke with blindnes from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the dore. <sup>12</sup>And they said to Lot: Hast thou here anie of thine? sonne in law, or sonnes, or daughters, al that are thine, bring them out of this citie: <sup>13</sup>for we wil destroy this place, for that their crye is waxen lowde before our Lord, who hath sent vs to destroy them. <sup>14</sup>Therfore Lot went forth, and spake to his sonnes in law that were to take his daughters, and said: Arise: get you forth out of this place, because our Lord wil destroy this citie. And he semed vnto them to speake as it were in iest. <sup>15</sup>And when it was morning, the angels vrged him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters which thou hast: least thou also perish withal in the wickednes of the citie. <sup>16</sup>He lingring, they tooke his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters,
