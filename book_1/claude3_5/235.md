and lightenings to flash, and a verie thicke cloude to couer the mount, and the noyse of the trumpet sounded excee<sup>17</sup>dingly: and the people, that was in the campe, feared. And when Moyses had brought them forth to meete with God from the place of the campe, they stoode at the botome of <sup>18</sup>the mount. And al the mount Sinai smoked: for because our Lord was descended vpon it in fyre, and the smoke arose from it as out of a fornace: and al the mount was terrible. <sup>19</sup>And the sound of the trumpet grew lowder by litle and litle, and was drawen out a length: Moyses spake, and God <sup>20</sup>answered him. And our Lord descended vpon the mount Sinai in the very toppe of the mount, and he called Moyses <sup>21</sup>into the toppe therof. Whither when he was ascended, he said vnto him: Goe downe, and charge the people: lest perhaps they wil passe their limittes to see the Lord, and a very <sup>22</sup>great multitude of them perish. The priestes also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified, lest he strike them. <sup>23</sup>And Moyses said to our Lord: The comon people can not ascend into the mount Sinai: for thou didst charge, and command, saying: Put limittes about the mount, and san<sup>24</sup>ctifie it. To whom our Lord said: Goe, gette thee downe and thou shalt come vp, & Aaron with thee: but the priests and the people let them not passe the limittes, nor ascend to <sup>25</sup>the Lord, lest perhappes he kil them. And Moyses went downe to the people, and told them al.
