<sup>7</sup> And when there is a white colour in the
skinne, and hath changed the looke of the heare, and the
flesh also it selfe appeare quicke: it shal be iudged a verie
old leprosie, and growne into the skinne. The priest therefore
shal contaminate him, and shal not shut him vp, because he is
vncleane euidently. <sup>12</sup> But if the leprosie spring forth running
about in the skinne, and couer al the flesh from the head to
the feete, whatsoeuer falleth vnder the sight of the eies,
<sup>13</sup> the priest shal vew him, and shal iudge that he is taken with
a most cleane leprosie: for that it is al turned into whitenes,
and therfore the man shal be cleane. <sup>14</sup> But when
there shal appeare in him quicke flesh, <sup>15</sup> then by the iudgement of the priest he shal be polluted, and shal be reputed
among the vncleane. for quicke flesh if it be spotted with leprosie, is vncleane. <sup>16</sup> And if againe it be turned into white
nesse, and couer al the man, <sup>17</sup> the priest shal vew him, and
shal iudge him to be cleane. <sup>18</sup> And the flesh and the skinne
wherin a boile is risen, and healed, <sup>19</sup> and in the place of the
boile, there appeare a white scarre, or somewhat redde, the
man shal be brought to the priest: <sup>20</sup> and when he shal see
the place of the leprosie lower then the other flesh, and the
heare turned into whitenes, he shal contaminate him: for
the plague of leprosie is risen in the boile. <sup>21</sup> But if the heare
be of the old colour, and the scarre somewhat obscure, & be
not lower then the next flesh, he shal shut him vp seuen dayes.
<sup>22</sup> And if it be growne farder, he shal iudge him to haue the
leprosie, <sup>23</sup> but if it stay in his place, it is the scarre of a boile,
and the man shal be cleane. <sup>24</sup> And the flesh and skinne, that
fire hath burnt, and being healed hath a white or a redde
scarre, <sup>25</sup> the priest shal consider it, and loe it is turned into
whitenesse, and the place therof is lower then the other
skinne: he shal contaminate him, because the plague of leprosie is risen in the scarre. <sup>26</sup> But if the colour of the heare
be not changed, nor the blemish lower then the other flesh,
and the forme it self of the leprosie be somewhat obscure, he
shal shut him vp seuen dais, <sup>27</sup> and the seuenth day he shal behold him: if the leprosie be growne farder in the skinne, he
shal contaminate him, <sup>28</sup> but if the whitenes stay in his place,
not very cleare, it is the plague of a burning, and therefore
he shal be cleansed, because it is the scarre of a burning.
