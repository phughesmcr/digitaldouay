I wil geue thee thy hyre. The woman tooke, and nursed
the child: and when he was growen, deliuered him to Pha-
raos daughter. <sup>10</sup> Whom she adopted into the place of a
sonne, and called him Moyses, saying: Because from the
water I did take him. <sup>11</sup> In those dayes after that Moyses
was growen, he went forth to his brethren: and he saw their
affliction, and a man that was an Ægyptian striking one of
the Hebrewes his brethren. <sup>12</sup> And when he had looked
about hither & thither, and saw no man present, he stroke
the Ægyptian, and hid him in the sand. <sup>13</sup> And going forth
an other day, he saw two Hebrewes brawling: and he said
to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?
<sup>14</sup> Who answered: Who hath appointed thee prince & iudge
ouer vs? Wilt thou kil me, as yesterday thou didest the Ægy-
ptian? Moyses feared, and said: How is this thing come a-
broad? <sup>15</sup> And Pharao heard of this talke, and sought to
kil Moyses: who fleeing from his sight, abode in the Land
of Madian, and sate beside a wel. <sup>16</sup> And the priest of Ma-
dian had seuen daughters, which were come to draw water:
and when the troughes were filled, they desired to water
their fathers flockes. <sup>17</sup> The shepeheardes came vpon them,
and droue them away: and Moyses arose, and defending the
maides, watered their sheepe. <sup>18</sup> Who being returned to
Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are you come
sooner then you were woont? <sup>19</sup> They answered: A certaine
man an Ægyptian deliuered vs from the hand of the shep-
heardes: moreouer also he drew water with vs, and gaue the
sheepe to drinke. <sup>20</sup> But he said: Where is he? Why haue
you let the man goe? cal him that he may eate bread.
<sup>21</sup> Therfore Moyses sware that he would dwel with him.
And he tooke Sephora his daughter to wife: <sup>22</sup> who bare
him a sonne, whom he called Gersam, saying: I haue bene
a stranger in a forren countrey. And she bare an other,
whom he called Eliezer, saying: for the God of my father
my helper hath deliuered me out of the hand of Pharao.
<sup>23</sup> But after much time the king of Ægypt died: and the
children of Israel groning, cried out because of the workes:
and their crie ascended vnto God from the workes. <sup>24</sup> And
he heard their groning, & remembred the couenant which
he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. <sup>25</sup> And our Lord
looked vpon the children of Israel and knew them.
