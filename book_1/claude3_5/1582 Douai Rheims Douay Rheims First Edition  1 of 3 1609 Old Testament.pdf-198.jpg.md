the promise, concerning the frogges, which he had agreed to. 
Pharao <sup>13</sup>And our Lord did according to the word of Moyses: 
and the frogges dyed out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fieldes: <sup>14</sup>and they gathered them together into huge heapes, and the earth did rotte. <sup>15</sup>And 
Pharao seing that rest was geuen :: he hardened his owne hart, 
and heard them not, as our Lord had commanded. <sup>16</sup>And 
our Lord said to Moyses: Speake to Aaron: Stretch forth thy 
rodde, and strike the dust of the earth: and be there :: Sciniphes in the whole Land of Ægypt. <sup>17</sup>And they did so. And 
Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rodde: and he 
stroke the dust of the earth, and there were made sciniphes 
on men and on beastes: al the dust of the earth was turned 
into sciniphes through the whole Land of Ægypt. <sup>18</sup>And the 
enchanters with their enchantmentes practised in like 
maner, to bring forth sciniphes, and :: they could not: and 
there were sciniphes aswell on men as on beastes. <sup>19</sup>And the 
enchanters said to Pharao :: This is the finger of God. And 
Pharaos hart was indurate, and he heard them not as our 
Lord had commanded. <sup>20</sup>Our Lord also said to Moyses: Arise 
early, and stand before Pharao: for he wil goe forth to the 
waters: and thou shalt say to him: This saith our Lord: Dismisse my people to sacrifice vnto me. <sup>21</sup>And if thou wilt not 
dismisse them, behold I wil send in vpon thee, and vpon thy 
seruantes, and vpon thy people, and vpon thy houses al kind 
of :: flies: and the houses of Ægypt shal be filled with flies of 
diuers kindes, and the whole land wherein they shal be. 
<sup>22</sup>And I wil make the Land of Gessen meruelous in that day, 
wherin my people is, so that flies shal not be there: and thou 
shalt know that I am the Lord in the middes of the earth. 
<sup>23</sup>And I wil put a diuision betwene my people & thy people: 
to morow shal this signe be. <sup>24</sup>And Our Lord did so. And 
there came a very greuious flie into the houses of Pharao 
and of his seruantes, and into al the Land of Ægypt: and 
the Land was corrupted by such kind of flies. <sup>25</sup>And Pharao called Moyses and Aaron, and said to them: Goe and 
sacrifice to your God in this land. <sup>26</sup>And Moyses said: It can 
not so be done: for if we shal offer the abominations of the 
Ægyptians to the Lord our God: and :: we kil those thinges 
which the Ægyptians doe worshippe before them: they wil 
beate vs downe with stones. <sup>27</sup>We wil goe forth three dayes
