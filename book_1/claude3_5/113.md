encrease, and multiplie thee: that thou maiest be into multi-
tudes of peoples. <sup>4</sup> And geue he thee the blessings of A-
braham, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayest possesse
the land of thy peregrination, which he promised to thy
grandfather. <sup>5</sup> And when Isaac had dimist him, taking
his iourney he came to Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban the
sonne of Bathuel the Syrian, brother to Rebecca his mother.
<sup>6</sup> And Esau seing that his father had blessed Iacob, and
had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife
thence; and that after the blessing he had commanded him,
saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Cha-
naan: <sup>7</sup> and that Iacob obeying his parents was gone into
Syria: <sup>8</sup> hauing tryal also that his father did not willingly
see the daughters of Canaan: <sup>9</sup> he went to Ismael, and
tooke to wife besides them, which he had before, Maheleth
the daughter of Ismael Abrahams sonne, sister to Nabaioth.
<sup>10</sup> Therefore Iacob being departed from Bersabee, went on
to Haran. <sup>11</sup> And when he was come to a certaine place,
and would rest in it after sunne set, he "tooke one of the
stones that lay there, and putting it vnder his head, slept in
the same place. <sup>12</sup> And he saw in his sleepe "a ladder standing
vpon the earth, and the top therof touching heauen: the
angels also of God ascending and descending by it, <sup>13</sup> and
our Lord leyning vpon the ladder saying to him: I am the
Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the
Land, wherin thou sleepest, I wil geue to thee and to thy
seed. <sup>14</sup> And thy seed shal be as the dust of the earth: thou
shalt be dilated to the West, and to the East, & to the North,
and to the South: and IN THEE and thy seed al the tribes
of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED. <sup>15</sup> And I wil be thy
keeper whither so euer thou goest, and wil bring thee backe
into this land: neither wil I leaue thee, til I shal haue ac-
complished al things which I haue said. <sup>16</sup> And when Iacob
was awaked out of sleepe, he said: In dede our Lord is in
this place, and I wist not. <sup>17</sup> And trembling he said: How
terrible is this place! this is none other but the house of God,
<sup>18</sup> and the gate of heauen. And Iacob arising in the mor-
ning, tooke the stone, which he had laid vnder his head,
and "erected it for a title, powring oyle vpon the toppe.
<sup>19</sup> And he called the name of the citie Bethel, which before
<sup>20</sup> was called Luza. And he "vowed a vowe, saying: If God

braham to Ia-
cob, and his
sede, omitting
Esau: yea and
God repeteth
the same. v. 13.</aside>
