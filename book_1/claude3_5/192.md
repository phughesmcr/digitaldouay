Plagues

that act which an other doth, by his commandment or inforcement, and by law of nature and nations, divine and humane, is condemned as culpable and guiltie of the fault, which the other committeth: but these ministers say (in the places above cited) *God commandeth, inforceth, and worketh* al that a sinner doth. Ergo, God by this doctrin must be author, culpable, and guiltie of sinne. Which is so blasphemous, and horrible to Christian eares, that they dare not say it in expresse termes.

Seing then God is said to have indurated Pharaoes hart, and al confesse that induration of hart is a most grevous sinne, the controversie is: Whether God commanded, inforced, and wrought the induration in Pharaoes hart, or only permitted it? or what els God did to Pharao, wherby his hart was indurate; and finally by whom it was properly indurate, by God, or by Pharao him selfe? Al which S. Augustin explicateth, laying first this ground (which everie one is faithfully and firmly to beleue) that God never forsaketh any man, before he be first forsaken by the same man: yea God also long expecteth, that a sinner which much and often offendeth, *convert and live*. But when the sinner abideth long in his wickednes, of the multitude of sinnes riseth desperation, of desperation is ingendred obduration. *For when the impius is come to the depth of sinnes, he contemneth*. Obduration therfore cometh not of Gods powre compelling, but is ingendred by Gods remisnes, or indulgence, and so not divine powre, but divine patience did harden Pharaoes hart. How often soever therfore our Lord saith: *I wil indurate the hart of Pharao*, he would nothing else to be vnderstood, but I wil suspend my plagues and punishments, wherby I wil permit him through mine indulgence to be obdurate against me. Perhaps some wil aske, why did God by sparing him, let him be indurate? why did God take from him his wholsome punishment? I answer (sayeth he) this was done, because Pharao, for the huge heape of his sinnes, deserved not as a child to be corrected vnto amendment, but as an enemie was suffered to be indurate. For of them, whom Gods mercie suffereth not to be indurate, it is written: *God scourging everie child whom he receiveth*. And in an other place: *Whom I love I correct and chastise*. Againe: *I rebuke and chastise*. Let no man therfore with Paganes and Manichees presume to reprehend or blame Gods iustice, but certainly beleue, that not Gods violence made Pharao indurate, but his owne wickednes, and his vntamed pride against Gods preceptes. Againe, what els is it to say, *I wil indurate his hart*, but when my grace is absent from him, his owne wickednes wil obdurate him?

To know this by examples: water is congeled with vehement cold; but the heate of the sunne coming vpon it, is resolued, and the sunne departing, it freezeth againe. In like maner by the lasines of sinners, charitie waxeth cold, & they are hardened as yse: but when the heate of Gods mercie commeth vpon them, they are againe softned. So Pharao without iustice or compassion afflicting the Hebrewes, became as hard as yse, but Gods hand touching him with afflictions, he made humble supplication, that Moyses and Aaron would pray to God for him, promising what they demanded: againe, when the plagues were remoued, he was more indurate against God and his people, then before. Wherby we see, Gods gentlenes, indulgence, and sparing of Pharao, not his rigour, nor his wil or set purpose, but his permission, and Pharaoes owne wilful malice hardned his hart, and brought him to obstinate contempt of Gods commandments. And therfore God did only indurate him, in that comon phrase of speaking, as a father, or a master hauing brought vp his child or servant delicatly, and not sufficiently punished his frequent faultes, wherby he be-
