<sup>10</sup> him die, and we wil be the bondmen of our lord. Who said to them: Be it done according to your sentence: with whom soever it shal be found, be he my bondman, and you shal be guiltles. <sup>11</sup> Therfore in haste taking downe their sackes vpon the ground, euerie man opened. <sup>12</sup> Which when he had searched, beginning from the elder euen to the youngest, he found the cup in Beniamins sack. <sup>13</sup> But they renting their garments, and loading their asses againe, returned into the towne. <sup>14</sup> And Iudas formost with his brethren entred in to Ioseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they fel together before him on the ground. <sup>15</sup> To whom he said: Why would you doe soe? know you not that there is not the like to me in the science of diuining: <sup>16</sup> To whom Iudas said: What shal we answere, my lord? or what shal we speake, or be able iustly to pretend? God hath found the iniquitie of thy seruantes: loe we are al bondmen to my lord, both we, & he, with whom the cup was found. <sup>17</sup> Ioseph answered: God forbid that I should so doe: he that stole the cup, the same be my bondman: and goe you free vnto your father. <sup>18</sup> And Iudas approching nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee my lord, let thy seruant speake a word in thine eares, and be not angrie with thy seruant: for after Pharao thou art, <sup>19</sup> my lord. Thou didest aske thy seruantes the first time: Haue you a father or a brother? <sup>20</sup> and we answered thee my lord: We haue a father an old man, and a litle boy, that was borne in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and his mother hath him only, and his father loueth him tenderly. <sup>21</sup> And thou saidst to thy seruants: Bring him hither to me, and I wil set myn eyes on him. <sup>22</sup> We suggested to my lord: The boy can not leaue his father: for if he leaue him, he wil die. <sup>23</sup> And thou saidest to thy seruants: Vnlesse your youngest brother come with you, you shal no more see my face. <sup>24</sup> Therfore when we were gone vp to thy seruant our father, we told him al things that my lord did speake. <sup>25</sup> And our father said: Goe againe, and bye vs a litle wheate. <sup>26</sup> To whom we said: We can not goe: if our youngest brother shal goe downe with vs, we wil set forward together: otherwise he being absent, we dare not see the mans face. <sup>27</sup> Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bare me two. <sup>28</sup> One went forth, and you said: A beast did deuour him: and hitherto he appeareth not.
