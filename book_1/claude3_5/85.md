### CHAP. XVII.

<sup>5</sup> *Manie nations*] Abram signifying *High* or *Noble father*, changed into Abraham, which signifieth *Father of manie* (nations) and Sarai signifying *My princesse*, changed into Sara, which absolutly signifieth *Princesse*, importe great Mysteries intended by God. For by this changing of names was declared and confirmed, that Abraham by the issue that he should haue of Sara, should be the father of manie nations, which S. Paul expressly applieth to his spiritual children, those especially that should belieue in Christ, of the Gentiles prefigured by *Isaac, sonne of the free woman, by the promise*, as the Iewes were prefigured by *Ismael borne of the bond woman according to the flesh*, concluding with the prophet Esai, that *Manie are the children of the desolate, that before was barren*. For albeit Abraham was natural father of foure nations, The Ismaelites, Madianites, Idumeans, and the Israelites, yet he was spiritual father of manie more, to wit, of al nations that beleue in Christ from his owne time to the end of the world, of which some are Iewes, but the greatest part Gentiles: as the same Apostle sheweth. Rom. 4. Gal. 4. Ephes. 3. Collos. 1. and in other places. whereby is clere, that the Church of Christ doth alwayes consist of manie nations, not as Donatistes and Protestants absurdly say, sometimes of few inuisible or vnknowen persons, for so Abraham should sometimes be father of few or no nations, which derogateth either from Gods omnioporencie if he could not, or from his fidelitie if he should not maintaine his promise, made to Abraham for euer.

<sup>10</sup> *Shal be circumcised*] The Sacrament of Circumcision here first instituted, about 400. yeares before the Law of Moyses, is a perfect figure of Baptisme, resembling it in foure things. First by both these Sacraments the faithful are distinguished from infidels. Secondly profession of faith is made in them both, either by those that receiue the same, if they be of discretion, or by others for them, if they be infants. Thirdly by both these Sacraments entrance is made into the Church, and to the participation of other Sacraments and spiritual rites. Fourthly by these Sacraments is induced subiection to the iurisdiction, and lawes of the Church. But Baptisme doth farre excel Circumcision in that it is more easie, or lesse painful, more vniuersal, for it pertaineth to al nations, and both sexes; and especially in vertue and efficacie, for Baptisme as an instrumental cause requireth, finneth and iustifieth, Circumcision was only a signe that grace was geuen, & sinne remitted. Againe Baptisme imprinteth a character in the soule, the other leaueth a marke only in the flesh. Finally Baptisme openeth the gate of heauen, in vertue of Christs passion now past, which circumcision could not before Christ suffered death. Of which both resemblance and difference S. Augustin treateth in manie places, especially li. 3. de doct. christ c. 9. Epist. 118. and Ianuarium. li. 19. c. 13. cont. Faust & in Psal. 73. where he also maketh like comparison between other Sacraments of the old and new Testament.

<sup>14</sup> *Shal be destroyed*] Here occurre two difficulties about the true sense of this hard place. First whether this punishment belonged to them only, by whose fault circumcision was omitted, or to infants also that should be circumcised and were not. Secondly whether temporal punishment, or eternal
