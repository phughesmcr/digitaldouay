thou at thy entring in, and to bring thee in, and geue thee their land in possession, as thou seest this present day. <sup>39</sup>Know therfore this day, and thinke in thy hart that our Lord he is God in heauen aboue, and in the earth beneth, and there is none other. <sup>40</sup>Keepe his preceptes and commandementes, which I command thee: that it may be wel with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayest remayne a long time vpon the Land, which the Lord thy God wil geue thee. <sup>41</sup>Then Moyses separated three cities beyond Iordan at the east side, <sup>42</sup>that he might flee to them which should kil his neighbour not voluntarily, neither was his enemie a day or two before, and he might scape to some of these cities: <sup>43</sup>Bosor in the wildernesse, which is situated in the champion countrie of the tribe of Ruben: and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad: and Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of manasses. <sup>44</sup>This is the law, that Moyses sette before the children of Israel, <sup>45</sup>and these are the testimonies and ceremonies and iudgementes, which he spake to the children of Israel, when they came out of Ægypt, <sup>46</sup>beyond Iordan in the valley against the temple of Phogor in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrheite, that dwelt in Hesebon, whom Moyses stroke. The children of Israel also comming out of Ægypt <sup>47</sup>possessed his land, and the land of Og the king of Basan, the two kinges of the Amorrheites, which were beyond Iordan toward the rysing of the sunne: <sup>48</sup>from Aroer, which is situated vpon the banke of the torrent Arnon, vnto the mountaine Sion, which is also <sup>49</sup>Hermon, al the plaine beyond Iordan at the east side, vnto the sea of the wildernesse, and vnto the foote of mount Phasga.
