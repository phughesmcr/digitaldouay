and dilate my seed as the sand of the sea, which for multitude
<sup>13</sup>can not be numbred. And when he had slept there that
night, he separated of those things which he had, giftes to
<sup>14</sup>his brother Esau, † he goates two hundred, he goates
<sup>15</sup>twentie, ewes two hundred, and rammes twentie, † thirtie
milch camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and twentie
<sup>16</sup>bulles, twentie she asses, and their foles ten. † And he sent
by the handes of his seruants, euerie flocke by it selfe, and
he said to his seruants: Goe before me, and let there be a
<sup>17</sup>space between flocke and flocke. † And he commanded the
former, saying: If thou mete my brother Esau, and he aske
thee, whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose
<sup>18</sup>are these that thou doest folowe? † thou shalt answere:
Iacobes thy seruant, he hath sent them for gifts to my lord
<sup>19</sup>Esau: himselfe also cometh after vs. † In like maner he
gaue commandements to the second, and the third, and
to al that folowed the flockes, saying: With the selfe same
<sup>20</sup>words speake ye to Esau, when you shal finde him. † And

<sup>25</sup>wrastled with him til morning. † Who when he saw that
he could not ouercome him, he touched the sinowe of his
<sup>26</sup>thighe, and forthwith it shranke. † And he said to him: Let
me goe for it is breake of day. He answered: I wil not let
<sup>27</sup>thee goe, vnlesse thou blesse me. † He therefore said: What
<sup>28</sup>is thy name? He answered: Iacob. † But he, no, thy name,
quoth he, :: shal not be called Iacob, but Israel: for if thou
hast bene strong against God, how much more shalt thou pre-
<sup>29</sup>uaile against men? † Iacob asked him: Tel me by what name
art thou called? He answered: why doest thou aske my name?
<sup>30</sup>and blessed him in the same place. † And Iacob called the
name of the place Phanuel, saying: I haue sene God face to
