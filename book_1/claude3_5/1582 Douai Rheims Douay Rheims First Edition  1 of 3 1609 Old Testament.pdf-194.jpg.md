<aside>Plagues</aside>

<aside>Freewil the cause of sinners induration in Pharao and Nabucodonosor.</aside>

*raiseth punishments*. Cap. 11. Did not Nabucodonosor repent being punished after innumerable impieties, and recouered the kingdome which he had lost? But Pharao by punishment became more obdurate, and perished. Both were men, both Kings, both persecutors of Gods people, both gently admonished by punishment. What then made their endes diuers, but that the one feeling Gods hand mourned in remembrance of his owne iniquitie, the other by his freewil fought against Gods most merciful visite?

<aside>Other ancient Doctors teach the same.</aside>

Neither is this the doctrin of S. Augustine alone, but of other Doctors also. Origen[^1] saith: the Scripture sheweth manifestly, that Pharao was indurate by his owne wil. For so God saied to him: *Thou wouldest not: if thou wilt not dismisse Israel*.

S. Basil[^2] saith, God beginning with lesse scourges, proceeded with greater and greater to plague Pharao, but did not mollifie him being obstinate, neither yet did punish him with death, vntil he drowned himselfe, when he presumed through pride, to passe the same way, by which the iust went, supposing the reade sea would be passable to him, as it was to the people of God. S. Chrysostom[^3]. God is saied in holie Scripture to haue indurate some, and deliuered some into reprobate sense, not for that these things are done by God (comming in dede of mans owne proper malice) but because God iustly leauing men, these things happen to them. And[^4] *He deliuered* (into reprobate sense) *is nothing els, but he permitted*. S. Damascen[^5]. It is the maner of holie Scripture to cal the permission of God his act. As, *He hath geuen them the spirit of compunction: eyes, that they may not see: and eares that they may not heare*, and the like; al which are to be vnderstood not as proceding of Gods action, but as of Gods permission, to wit, for mans free power of working. S. Hierom[^6]. None patience is to be excused, but their hardnes to be accused, which abuse Gods goodnes to their owne perdition. Theodoret[^7]. It is to be noted, that if Pharao had bene euil by nature, he had neuer changed his minde. And (after diuers mutations recited, how sometimes he would dismisse Israel, other times he would not) al these (saith he) Moyses recorded to teach vs, that neither Pharao was of peruerse nature, neither did our Lord God make his mind hard and rebellious. For he that now inclineth to this part, now to that, plainly sheweth freewil of the mind.

<aside>Gregorie the great.</aside>

S. Gregorie[^8] God is saied to indurate by his iustice, when he doth not mollifie a reprobate hart. And[^9] Our Lord is saied to haue indurated Pharaos hart, not that he brought the hardnes of selfe, but for that his desertes so requiring, he did not mollifie it, with sensibilitie of feare infused from aboue. S. Isidorus[^10]. Sinne is permitted for punishment of sinne, when a sinner, for his desert forsaken of God, goeth into an other worse sinne.

<aside>Isidorus.</aside>

Finally conscience of holie Scriptures, as in other hard places, so in this, geueth light for better vnderstanding therof. For diuers places do not only shew that in al these resistances, mutations of mind, and obstinacie of hart, Pharao was neuer depriued of freewil, as the Doctors before cited do note, but also expressly attribute the act of induration to himselfe. Cha. 8. v. 15. *Pharao seing that rest was geuen he hardened his owne hart*. v. 32. where the latin readeth in the passiue voice, *ingrauatum est cor Pharaonis*, *Pharaos hart was hardned*, which is more obscure, the Hebrew saith actiuely, & the protestantes so translate, 1579. *Pharao hardened his hart this time also*. Likewise cha. 9. v. 7. the Hebrew saith, 1577. *Pharaos hart hardned it selfe*. Also v. 35. *He hardned his owne hart, he and his seruants*.
