# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF EXODVS.

<hr>

MOYSES hauing prosecuted in Genesis, the sacred historie of the church, vnto Iosephs death, containing the space of 2310. yeares, con-
tinueth the same in Exodus, for 145. yeares more. Where he first briefly re-
counteth, how a smal number of Israelites, especially after the death of Io-
seph, being much increased, a new King (risen in the meane time, who
knew not Ioseph) together with other Ægyptians, enuying their better
partes, both of bodie and minde, and more fortunate progres in wealth; fea-
ring also lest they stil multiplying, either by their owne forces, or ioyning
with other foreners, might spoile Ægypt, and returne into Chanaan; and
hating their Religion, because they acknowledged, one onlie, eternal, omni-
potent God, denying and detesting the new imaginarie goddesse of the Ægypti-
ans; resolued and publikely decreed, by oppression to hinder their increasing, &
to keepe th m in bondage and seruitude. But God almightie, who had chosen
them for his peculiar people, did not only so conserue and multiplie them; that
of seuentie persons, which came into Ægypt, in the space of two hundred and
fiftene yeres, there were six hundred thousand men, able to beare armes, be-
sides women, children, and old men, which by estimation might be three milli-
ons in al, but amongst other most strange and miraculous workes, especially de-
liuered one Hebrew infant from drowning. whom afterwards he made the
Guide, and supreme Gouernour of the same people; by him admonished the
King to cease persecuting, and diuers times plagued him & his people for their
obdurate and obstinate cruelties. In fine called away, and mightily deliuered
his owne people; drowned that king and al his armie, in the red sea, the Israe-
lites wonderfully passing through, as in a drie chanel, the waters standing on
both sides, like two walles. In the desert fed them miraculously with Manna,
and gaue them al necessaries, defending them also from enimies. Then God, ha-
uing thus selected and seuered his people from al other nations, gaue them a
written law, as wel of Moral, as Ceremonial and Iudicial precepts, with the
maner of making the Tabernacle, erecting Altares, consecrating Priestes, with
the institution of daylie Sacrifice, and of al vestures, vessels, & other holie
things belonging to the seruice of God. So this booke may be diuided into three
partes. First is declared the Israelites seruile affliction in Ægypt, with their
deliuerie from thence in the seuen first chapters. Then how they were maintai-
ned in the desert, and prepared to receiue a law; in the foure next chapters.
In the other 21. chapters, the law is prescribed, instructing them how to liue
towards God, and al men.
