countrie man and neighbour thou shalt not haue power to
require it. <sup>4</sup> And a needie person and begger there shal be
none among you: that our Lord thy God may blesse thee in
the land, which he wil geue thee in possession. <sup>5</sup> Yet so if thou
heare the voice of our Lord thy God, and keepe al thinges
that he hath bid, and which I command thee this day, he wil
blesse thee, as he hath promised. <sup>6</sup> Thou shalt lend to manie
nations, and thy selfe shalt borrow of no man. Thou shalt
haue dominion ouer verie manie nations, and no man shal
haue dominion ouer thee. <sup>7</sup> If one of thy brethren that abi-
deth within the gates of thy citie in the land, which our
Lord thy God wil geue thee, come to pouertie: thou shalt not
harden thy hart, nor close thy hand, <sup>8</sup> but shalt open it to the
poore man, and shalt lend him, that which thou perceiuest he
hath neede of. <sup>9</sup> Beware lest perhaps an impious cogitation
steale in vpon thee, and thou say in thy hart: The seuenth
yeare of remission draweth nigh; & turne away thy eies from
thy poore brother denying to lend him that which he asketh:
lest he crie against thee to our Lord, and it become a sinne
vnto thee. <sup>10</sup> But thou shalt geue to him: neither shalt thou
doe any thing craftely in releuing his necessities: that our
Lord thy God may blesse thee at al times, and in al thinges
whereunto thou shalt put thy hand. <sup>11</sup> There shal not want
poore in the land of thy habitation: therfore I command thee
that thou open thy hand to thy needie and poore brother,
that liueth in the Land. <sup>12</sup> When thy brother an Hebrew
man, or Hebrew woman is sold to thee, and hath serued thee
six yeares, in the seuenth yeare, thou shalt let him goe free:
<sup>13</sup> and to whom thou geuest freedom, thou shalt in no case
suffer him to depart emptie: <sup>14</sup> but geue him his wayfare of
thy flockes, and of thy barne floore, and thy presse, wher-
with our Lord thy God shal blesse thee. <sup>15</sup> Remember that
thy self also didst serue in the Land of Ã†gypt, and our Lord
thy God made thee free, and therfore doe I now command
thee. <sup>16</sup> But if he say: I wil not depart: because he loueth
thee, and thy house, and feeleth that he is wel with thee:
<sup>17</sup> thou shalt take an awle, and bore through his eare in the
dore of thy house, and he shal serue thee for euer. to thy wo-
man seruant also thou shalt doe in like maner. <sup>18</sup> Turne not
away thine eies from them, when thou makest them free:
