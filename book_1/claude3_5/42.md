ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. VI.

[^1] *Sonnes of God:*] The progenie of Seth professing true faith & Religion,
were called the sonnes of God: and those of Cains illiue and congregation,
folowing erronious and wicked opinions, were called the sonnes of men.
Which were then the distinctiue termes of true and false Religion, as after-
wardes were the termes of Iewes and Gentiles: after Christ, Christians and
Paganes: and lastly true and false Christians are distinguished, by the names
of Catholiques and Heretikes. As S. Augustin teacheth, in his questions vpon
Genesis, & other places. Which is confirmed by the like iudgement of S. Cyril
Alexandrinus li. 9. aduers. Iulianum. S. Ambrose li. de Noe & arca. c. 4. S. Pa-
cianus epist. ad Symphorianum. Theodoret. & manie others vpon this place.

[^2] *An hundred and twentie yeares.*] Mans life was not here shortened to an
hundred and twentie yeares, as some haue misunderstood this place. For after
this diuers liued much longer, as appeareth in the genealogie of Sem to Abram
in the 11. chapter of Genesis. And Abraham liued 175. yeares (c. 25.) Isaac 180.
(c. 35.) Iacob 147. (c. 47.) and Ioiadas borne 1500. yeares after, liued 130.
yeares (2. Par. 24.) But 120. yeares were granted before the floud for that ge-
neration to repent in, as the Chaldee Edition expresseth more plainly:
*Terminus dabitur eis centum viginti annorum si forte conuertentur.* The tearme of an
hundred and twentie yeares shal be geuen them, if perhaps they may conuert.
And so S. Chrisostom. S. Hierom. and S. Augustin expound this Scripture.
Yet whether God cut of 10. of these yeares, and brought the floud after a
100 (for Noe had his sonnes when he was 500. yeares old, & the floud came in
the 600. yeare of his age) or that this warning was geuen twentie yeares be-
fore anie of his sonnes were borne, is not so easely decided by the holie Doctors.
How easie soeuer Protestants say al Scriptures are. Though vnder correction
of better iudgement, it semeth more probable, that Moyses by anticipation
ioyneth the birth of Noes sonnes (when he was 500. yeares old) to the rest of
the genealogie of the first Patriarkes, in the former chapter, and then telleth
of this admonition, geuen 20. yeares before their birth. And so God expected
the peoples repentance the whole time of 120. yeares prescribed.

[^3] *Giants were vpon the earth.*] Some haue thought that these giantes were
not men, nor begotten by men, but that either diuels, which fel at first
from heauen, or other Angels allured with concupiscence, begate them of the
daughters of Cain. Philo Iudeus in his booke de Gigantibus, writeth that
those whom Moyses here called *Angels*, the Philosophers called *Genios. Qui
sunt animalia aerea, which are liuing creatures with ayrie bodies* Iosephus (li. 1.
Antiq.) saith that Angels begate these giants. Tertullian also li. de habitu
muliebri) holdeth the same error, and diuers more otherwise good authors.
