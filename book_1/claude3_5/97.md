Hebron, in the land of Chanaan: And Abraham came to
<sup>3</sup> mourne, and weepe for her. <sup>4</sup> And after that he was risen
vp from the funeral obsequies, he spake to the children
of Heth, saying: I am a stranger and pilgrime among
you: geue me the right of a sepulchre with you, that I
<sup>5</sup> may burie my dead. <sup>6</sup> The children of Heth answered,
saying: My lord heare vs, thou art a prince of God a-
mong vs: in our principal sepulchres burie thou thy dead:
and no man can let thee but that in his owne monument
<sup>7</sup> thou mayest burie thy dead. <sup>8</sup> Abraham rose vp, and ad-
ored the people of the land, to wit the children of Heth:
and he said to them: If it please your soule that I burie
my dead, heare me, and be intercessors for me to Ephron
<sup>9</sup> the sonne of Seor: that he geue me the duble caue,
which he hath in the vttermost part of his field: for money
to the worth therof let him deliuer it to me before you
<sup>10</sup> for possession of a sepulchre. And Ephron dwelt in the
middest of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer
to Abraham in the hearing of al that went in at the gate
<sup>11</sup> of the citie, saying: No, it shal not be so, my lord, but
thou rather harken to that which I doe say: The field I
deliuer to thee, and the caue that is therin, in the presence
<sup>12</sup> of the children of my people, burie thy dead. Abra-
<sup>13</sup> ham adored before the people of the land. And he
spoke to Ephron, his people standing round about: I beseech
thee to heare me: I wil geue money for the field: take it,
<sup>14</sup> and so I wil burie my dead in it. <sup>15</sup> And Ephron answered:
My lord, heare me. The ground which thou desirest, is
worth foure hundred sicles of siluer: this is the price
between me and thee: but how much is this? burie thy dead.
<sup>16</sup> Which when Abraham had heard, he weyed the money,
that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of
Heth, foure hundred sicles of siluer of common currant
<sup>17</sup> money. And the field that before time was Ephrons,
wherin was the duble caue, looking towards Mambre,
as wel it, as the caue, and al the trees therof in al the lymits
<sup>18</sup> therof round about: was made sure to Abraham for a
possession, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of al
<sup>19</sup> that went in at the gate of his citie. And so Abraham buried
Sara his wife in the duble caue of the field, that looked
towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.
