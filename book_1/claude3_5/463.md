<sup>4</sup> Moabite yea after the tenth generation shall not enter into the church of our Lord, for ever: because they would not meete you with bread and water in the way, when you came out of Ægypt: and because they hyred against thee Balaam, the sonne of Beor of Mesopotamia in Syria, to curse thee: <sup>5</sup> and our Lord thy God would not heare Balaam, and he turned his cursing into thy blessing, for that he loved thee. <sup>6</sup> Thou shalt not make peace with them, neither doe thou seeke their good al the daies of thy life for ever. <sup>7</sup> Thou shalt not abhorre the Idumeite, because he is thy brother: nor the Ægyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. <sup>8</sup> They that are borne of them, in the third generation shal enter into the church of our Lord. <sup>9</sup> When thou goest forth against thyne enemies to battel, thou shalt keepe thy self from al evil thing. <sup>10</sup> If there be among you a man, that is polluted in a dreame by night, he shal goe forth without the campe, <sup>11</sup> and shal not returne, before he be washed with water at even: and after sunne sette he shal returne into the campe. <sup>12</sup> Thou shalt have a place without the campe, whither thou mayest goe to the necessities of nature, <sup>13</sup> carying on thy girdle a piked instrument. & when thou sittest downe, thou shalt digge round about, and with the earth that is digged vp shal cover <sup>14</sup> that which thou art eased of (for our Lord thy God walketh in the middes of thy campe, to deliver thee, and to geve thyne enemies vnto thee) and let thy campe be holie, and let no filthines appeare therein, lest he forsake thee. <sup>15</sup> Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his Maister, that is fled to thee. <sup>16</sup> he shal dwel with thee in the place, that shal please him, and in one of thy cities shal he rest: vexe him not. <sup>17</sup> There shal be no whoore of the daughters of Israel, nor whoremonger of the sonnes of Israel. <sup>18</sup> Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strompet, nor the price of a dogge, in the house of our Lord thy God, whatsoever it be that thou hast vowed: because both is abomination before our Lord thy God. <sup>19</sup> Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to vsurie, <sup>20</sup> nor corne, nor any other thing: but to the stranger. And to thy brother thou shalt lend, that which he needeth without vsurie: that our Lord thy God may blesse thee in al thy worke in the Land, which thou shalt enter to possesse. <sup>21</sup> When thou hast vowed a vow to our Lord thy God, thou shalt not slacke to pay it: because our Lord thy God wil require it.

<aside>hurt the children of Israel, neither by denying ordinary necessities, nor by force, nor by hyring Balaa to curse them, yet inveigling them with carnal sinnes, signified obstinate perverse sinners, that never amending can never be rightly received into the Church of God.</aside>

[^1]: Onlie lawful enemies are here called strangers: wherefore it is iust cause of warre, there only it is lawful to exercise vsurie. *Amb. li. de Tob. c. 15.*
