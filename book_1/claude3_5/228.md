This is the word, that our Lord hath commanded: Let euerie one gather of it so much as sufficeth to eate: a gomor euerie man, according to the number of your soules that dwel in a tent so shal you take vp. <sup>17</sup> And the children of Israel did so: and they gathered, one more, an other lesse. <sup>18</sup> And they measured by the measure of a gomor: neither he that gathered more, had aboue: nor he that prouided lesse, found vnder: but euerie one gathered, according to that which they were able to eate. <sup>19</sup> And Moyses said to them: Let no man leaue therof til the morning. <sup>20</sup> Who heard him not, but certaine of them left vntil the morning, and it beganne to be ful of wormes, and it putrified, and Moyses was angrie against them. <sup>21</sup> And euerie one of them gathered in the morning, so much as might suffice to eate: and after the sunne waxed hotte, it melted. <sup>22</sup> But in the sixt day they gathered duble portions, that is, two gomors euerie man: and al the princes of the multitude came, and told Moyses. <sup>23</sup> Who said to them: This is it which our Lord hath spoken: The Sabbathes rest is sanctified vnto our Lord to morow.
