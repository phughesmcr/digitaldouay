<sup>4</sup> But if thou resist, and wilt not dismiss them: behold I wil bring in to morow the locust into thy coastes: <sup>5</sup> which may couer the face of the earth, that nothing thereof appeare, but that which the haile hath left may be eaten: for it shal gnawe al trees that spring in the fieldes. <sup>6</sup> And they shal fil thy houses, and the houses of thy seruantes, and of al the Egyptians: such a number as thy fathers haue not seene, nor grand-fathers, since they arose vpon the earth, vntil this present day. And he turned him selfe away, and went forth from Pharao. <sup>7</sup> And Pharaoes seruantes said to him: How long shal we endure this scandal? Dismisse the men, to sacrifice to the Lord their God. Doest thou not see that Egypt is vndone? <sup>8</sup> And they called back Moyses, and Aaron vnto Pharao: who said to them: Goe, sacrifice to the Lord your God: who are they that shal goe? <sup>9</sup> Moyses said: With our young and old we wil goe, with our sonnes and daughters, with our sheepe and heardes: for it is the solemnitie of the Lord our God. <sup>10</sup> And Pharao answered: So be the Lord with you, as I shal dismisse you, and your litle ones: who doubteth but that you intend very wickedly? <sup>11</sup> It shal not so be: but goe ye men only, and sacrifice to the Lord: for this your selues also desired. And immediately they were cast out from Pharaoes sight. <sup>12</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Stretch forth thy hand vpon the Land of Aegypt vnto the locust, that it come vpon it, and deuoure euerie herbe that remained after the haile. <sup>13</sup> And Moyses stretched forth his rodde vpon the Land of Aegypt: and our Lord brought in a burning wind al that day, & night: and when it was morning, the burning winde raised the locusts: <sup>14</sup> which came vp ouer the whole Land of Aegypt: and sate in al the coastes of the Aegyptians innumerable, the like as had not bene before that time, nor shal be afterward. <sup>15</sup> And they couered the whole face of the earth, wasting al thinges. Therfore the grasse of the earth was deuoured, and what fruites soeuer on the trees, which the haile had left: there was also nothing at al left that was greene in the trees, and in the herbes of the earth, in al Aegypt. <sup>16</sup> For the which cause Pharao in hast called Moyses and Aaron, and said to them: I haue sinned against the Lord your God, and against you. <sup>17</sup> But now forgeue me my sinne this time also, and pray to the Lord your God, that he take away from me this death.
