ministresh to our Lord thy God, and the decree of the iudge, that man shal die, and thou shalt take away the euil out of Israel: <sup>13</sup> and the whole people hearing shal feare, that none afterward swel in pride. <sup>14</sup> When thou art entred the Land, which our Lord thy God wil geue thee, and doest possesse it, and dwellest in it, and sayest: I wil sette a king ouer me, as al nations haue round about: <sup>15</sup> him shalt thou sette, whom our Lord thy God shal choose of the number of thy brethren. A man of an other nation that is not thy brother, thou canst not make king. <sup>16</sup> And when he is made, he shal not multiplie to him selfe horses, nor lead backe the people into Ã†gypt, taking high courage for the number of his horsemen, especially whereas our Lord hath commanded you that in no case you returne any more the same way. <sup>17</sup> He shal not haue manie wiues, that may allure his minde, nor huge weightes of siluer and gold. <sup>18</sup> And after he shal sitte in the throne of his kingdome, he shal copie to him selfe the Deuteronomie of this Law in a volume, taking the copie of the priestes of the Leuitical tribe, <sup>19</sup> and he shal haue it with him, and shal reade it al the dayes of his life, that he may learne to feare our Lord his God, and keepe his wordes and ceremonies, that are commanded in the law. <sup>20</sup> And that his hart be not lifted vp into pride ouer his brethren, nor decline to the right side or the left side, that he may reigne a long time, and his sonnes ouer Israel.

CHAP. XVII.

<aside>Supreme Iuge of controuersies.</aside>

8. *If the iudgement be hard.*] For a ful and assured decision of al controuersies, God here instituted to his people a supreme Tribunal, that in case inferior Iudges varied in iudgement, recourse might be had to the Councel of Priestes, where one chiefe Iudge, the High Priest, was appointed to geue sentence, and al others commanded to receiue and obey the same.

<aside>Sentence of the Iewes consistorie infallible.</aside>

9. *Who shal shew thee the truth.*] God so assisted this consistorie with his spirite of truth, that their sentence was infallible: though otherwise they might erre, either in life, or in priuate opinion. Wherefore, our Sauiour distinguishing betwene their publique doctrin, and their workes, taught the people, that for so much as the Scribes and Pharisees sate in Moyses chaire, and yet transgressed Gods commandmentes, euerie one should *obserue and doe al things whatsoeuer they should say to them: but not doe according to their workes*. Mat. 23. And S. Iohn ascribeth the true sentence geuen by Caiphas in the councel, to his office of High Priest, saying: (Iohn. 11.) *He said not this of him selfe, but being the high priest of that yeare, he prophesied that* IESVS *should die for the nation and to gather into one the children of God.*

[^1]: Pluralitie of wiues is not here forbid; for king Dauid transgressed not this precept hauing more then one or two: but Salomon offended in multiplying manie wiues. 3. Reg. 9. 17. in Deut.

[^2]: Temporal good Princes take the law, and word of God, at the Priests handes.
