ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. I.

1. *In the beginning*] Holie Moyses telleth what was done in the beginning of the world, and so forward euen til his owne time, writing aboue two thousand and foure hundreth yeares after the beginning. Al which being incomprehensible by humane witte or discourse, he knew partly by Reuelations from God, for he had the gyft of Prophecie in most excellent forte: partly by Traditions from his elders, who lerned of their fathers. For vntil that time the Church had only Traditions of such things, as were reueiled to special men, wherby we see the great authoritie of Traditions, before there were Scriptures. And since Scriptures were written they are also necessarie, for three special reasons. First for that we are not assured by Tradition of the Church, that those bookes are in dede holie Scriptures, which are so accounted, and not by the Scripture it selfe, for that were to proue the same by the same, vntil we be assured of some part, that proueth some other partes. And this made S. Augustin to say plainly, that *he could not beleue the Gospel, except the Church did moue him which is the Gospel*. Secondly holie Scriptures being once knowen to be the word of God, and so of most eminent authoritie of al writings in the world, as S. Augustin S. Ierome, & al other Fathers agree, yet for the true vnderstanding of the same, both the Scripture it selfe, and the ancient Fathers remitte vs to the Church, namely to those of the Church, that are *appointed* by Gods ordinance, *in the high places that he hath chosen*. Which were the High Priests in the old Testament, as appeareth Deut. 17. Mat. 23. Ioan. 11. And in the new Testament, S. Peter and his Successors for whom Christ prayed that his faith should not faile: and therfore commanded him to confirme his bretheren Luc. 22. Thirdly for things not expressed in particular in holie Scripture, the Scripture and Fathers do likewise remitte vs to Traditions, and to the iudgement and testimonie of the Church. Christ saying to his Apostles: *he that heareth me*. The Apostles declared not to fay *al things* by mouth *to the whole Church and to the Pastors*. And S. Paul willed the Thessalonians *to hold the traditions, which they had learned whether it were by word, or by his Epistle*.

[^2]: The Church had only Traditions & no Scripture aboue 2400. yeares.

[^3]: Traditions necessarie for three causes.

1. *In the beginning, God made heauen and earth.*] Al writers ancient and later find such difficulties in these first chapters, that some otherwise very learned haue thought it not possible to vnderstand the same according to the proper and vsual signification of the wordes, as the letter may seme to sound, but expound al allegorically, as that by the waters aboue the firmament should be vnderstood the blessed Angels, by the waters vnder the firmament wicked spirites, and the like. So did Origen and diuers that folow him therein. Yea S. Augustin in his bookes vpon Genesis against the Manichees, written
