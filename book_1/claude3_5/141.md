CHAP. XXXVIII.

Raise seed to thy brother. It is this appeareth, that in the law of nature when a maried man died without issue, his brother might lawfully marie the widow: whose first sonne should be counted and called the sonne and heyre of his vncle dead before. The same was established by the law at Moyses (Deut. 25) Which being now abrogated, it remaineth in the Churches power to constitute law in this behalf, and consequently to dispense in the same, so farre as is agreable with the law of nature. Whereof see more. Leuit. 18.

And Ioseph was of beautiful countenance, and comely fauored to behold. <sup>7</sup>After manie dayes therefore his maistresse cast her eyes on Ioseph, and said: Sleepe with me. <sup>8</sup>Who in no wise assenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my maister hauing deliuered al thinges vnto me, knoweth not what he hath in his owne house: <sup>9</sup>neither is there any thing
