because he is flesh: & his dayes shal be <sup>3</sup>an hundred & twentie yeares. <sup>4</sup>And Giantes were vpon the earth in those dayes.[^1] For after the sonnes of God did companie with the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, these be the mightie of the olde world, famous men. <sup>5</sup>And God seing the malice of men was much on the earth, and that al the cogitation of their hart was bent to euil at al times, <sup>6</sup>it repented him that he had made man on the earth. And touched inwardly with sorrow of hart, <sup>7</sup>I wil, saith he, cleane take away man, whom I haue created, from the face of the earth, from man euen to beastes, from that which creepeth euen vnto the foules of the ayre. for it repenteth me that I haue made them.

<sup>8</sup>But Noe found grace before our Lord. <sup>9</sup>These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a iust and perfect man in his generations, he did walke with God. <sup>10</sup>And he begat three sonnes, Sem, Cham, & Iapheth. <sup>11</sup>And the earth was corrupted before God, and was replenished with iniquitie. <sup>12</sup>And when God had perceined that the earth was corrupted (for al flesh had corrupted his way vpon the earth) <sup>13</sup>he said to Noe: The end of al flesh is come before me, the earth is replenished with iniquitie from the face of them, & I wil destroy them with the earth. <sup>14</sup>Make thee an arke of timber plankes: cabinetes shalt thou make in the arke, and shalt pitch it within, and without with bitume. <sup>15</sup>And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the Arke shal be three hundred cubites: fiftie cubites the breadth, and thirtie cubites the height of it. <sup>16</sup>Thou shalt make a windowe in the arke, and in a cubit finish the toppe of it: and the dore of the arke thou shalt set at the side belowe, middle chambers, and third loftes shalt thou make in it. <sup>17</sup>Behold I wil bring the waters of a great floud vpon the earth, that I may destroy al flesh, wherein there is breath of life vnder heauen. Al thinges that are in the earth, shal be consumed. <sup>18</sup>And I wil establish my couenant with thee: and thou shalt enter into the arke, thou and thy sonnes, and thy wife, and the wiues of thy sonnes with thee. <sup>19</sup>And of al liuing creatures of al flesh, thou shalt bring payres into the arke, that they may liue with thee: of the male sexe, and the female. <sup>20</sup>Of foules according to their kind, and of beastes in their kind, & of al that creepeth on the earth according to their kind:

[^1]: God who is immutable, & subiect to no passion, yet by the enormitie of sinnes seemeth prouoked to wrath, and to repent that he had made man. S. Amb. li. de Noe & arca. c. 4.
