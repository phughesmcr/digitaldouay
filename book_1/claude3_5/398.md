<sup>48</sup> whom is the familie of the Iefielites: Guni, of whom is the familie of the Gunites, <sup>49</sup> Ieser, of whom is the familie of the Ieserites: Sellem, of whom is the familie of the Sellemi­tes. <sup>50</sup> these are the kinredes of the sonnes of Nephthali by their families: whose number was fourtie fiue thousand foure hundred. <sup>51</sup> This is the summe of the children of Israel, that were reckened, six hundred thousand, and a thousand seuen hundred thirtie. <sup>52</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses saying: <sup>53</sup> To these shal the land be diuided according to the num­ber of names for their possessions. <sup>54</sup> To the greater number thou shalt geue a greater portion, and to the fewer a lesse: to euerie one, as they haue now beene reckened, shal possession be deliuered: <sup>55</sup> yet so that lotte doe diuide the Land to the tribes and the families. <sup>56</sup> Whatsoeuer shal chance by lotte, that let either the more take, or the fewer. <sup>57</sup> This also is the number of the sonnes of Leui by their families: Gerson, of whom the familie of the Gersonites: Caath, of whom the familie of the Caathites: Merari, of whom the familie of the Merarites. <sup>58</sup> these are the families of Leui: The familie of Lobni, the familie of Hebroni, the familie of Moholi, the fa­milie of Musi, the familie of Core. Howbeit Caath begatte Amram: <sup>59</sup> who had to wife Iochabed the daughter of Leui, who was borne to him in Ægypt. She bare to Amram her husband sonnes, Aaron and Moyses, and Marie their si­ster. <sup>60</sup> Of Aaron were borne Nadab and Abiu, and Eleazar and Ithamar: <sup>61</sup> of the which Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange fyre before our Lord. <sup>62</sup> And al that were numbred, were twentie three thousand of the male kind from one moneth and vpward: who were not reckened among the children of Israel, neither was their possession ge­uen with the rest. <sup>63</sup> This is the number of the children of Israel, that were enrolled by Moyses and Eleazar the priest, in the champion countrie of Moab vpon Iordan against Ie­richo. <sup>64</sup> Among whom there was none of them that were numbred before by Moyses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai. <sup>65</sup> For our Lord had foretold that al should die in the wilder­nesse. And none remained of them, but Caleb the sonne of Iephone, and Iosue the sonne of Nun.
