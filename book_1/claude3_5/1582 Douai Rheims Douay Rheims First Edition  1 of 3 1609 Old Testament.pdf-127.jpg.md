# GENESIS

## CHAP. XXXIII.

*Iacob seing Esau come with a great troupe of men, feareth harme, but is most curteously entertained by him. 10. He hardly perswadeth Esau to take giftes, 15. and to returne home. 17. So Iacob coming by Socoth to Salem, there byeth a field, pitcheth his tents, and erecteth an Altar.*

<sup>1</sup> AND Iacob lifting vp his eyes, saw Esau coming, and with him foure hundred men: and he diuided the children of Lia and of Rachel, and of the two handmaides:
<sup>2</sup> and he put both the handmaides & their children foremost: and Lia, and her children in the second place: and Rachel, and Ioseph last.
<sup>3</sup> And himselfe going foreward adored prostrate to the ground seuen times, vntil his brother came nere.
<sup>4</sup> Esau therefore running to mete his brother, embraced him: and clasping him fast about the necke, and kissing him wept.
<sup>5</sup> And casting vp his eyes, he saw the wemen and their litle ones, and said: What meane these? And do they perteyne to thee? He answered: They are the litle ones which God hath geuen to me thy seruant.
<sup>6</sup> And the handmaides and their children coming nere, bowed themselues:
<sup>7</sup> Lia also with her children came nere: and when they had adored in like maner, last Ioseph and Rachel adored.
<sup>8</sup> And Esau said: What are the troupes that I did mete? He answered: That I might find grace before my lord.
<sup>9</sup> But he said: I haue plentie, my brother, be thy things to thy selfe.
<sup>10</sup> And Iacob said: Do not so I besech thee, but if I haue found grace in thin eyes, take a litle present at my hands: for so haue I seene thy face, as if I should haue seene the countenance of God: be gracious to me,
<sup>11</sup> and take the blessing, which I haue brought thee, and which God hath geuen me, who geueth al thinges. Scarse at his brothers great instance, taking it,
<sup>12</sup> he said: Let vs march on together, and I wil accompanie thee in thy iourney.
<sup>13</sup> And Iacob said: My lord thou knowest that I haue with me litle ones, and sheepe, and kine with young: which if I cause to ouerlabour themselues in going, in one day al the flockes wil die.
<sup>14</sup> It may please my lord to goe before his seruant: and I wil folow softly after him, as I shal see my litle ones

[^1]: Iacob seing Gods hand in this change of his brothers mind, not of flatterie, but sincerely acknowledged his benignitie, as Gods countenance towards him.
