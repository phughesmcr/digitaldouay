19. *blessed him*) Calvin (in cap. 7. v. 9. Heb.) Musculus (locis com. c. de Missa Papist.) and some other Protestants to avoid the connexion of Melchisedechs Priesthood and bringing forth of bread and wine, wil needs have these wordes, *He was a Priest*, referred only to that which foloweth, *he blessed A-*
*braham*. And some English translators for this purpose have corrupted the text, Heretical by changing, *And* into *Therefore*, saying thus: *And he was a Priest of the most translation. high God, therefore he blessed him*. Which is also a false glosse. For Melchisedech did not blesse Abram because he was a Priest, for Abram was also a Priest, but because he was a greater Priest then Abram. which S. Paul urgeth saying: *Without al contradiction that which is lesse, is blessed of the better*, The greater concluding therupon that Melchisedech was greater then Abraham. Again blesseth the other Superiors that are not Priests may blesse their inferiors. As Iosue and lesse. Salomon blessed the people, and parents blesse their children.

20. *Gave tithes*) This is an other prerogative of Melchisedech, that Abram payed tithes to him, which S. Paul likewise (Heb. 7.) and generally al prove therby that Christs Priesthood is greater then the Leuitical. Moreover this paying of tithes by Abraham sheweth the antiquitie of this tradition, being practised in Abrahams time, that the spiritual Superiors received tithes of their inferiors.

CHAP. XV.

*Abram doubting and lamenting that he should have no childe, God promiseth him much issue, 6. who beleeving is iustified, 9. offereth sacrifice prescribed by God, 13. and is forwarned that his seede shal be in strange land 400. yeares. 14. shal be delivered from servitude 18. and possesse Chanaan.*

1 WHEN these things therefore were done, the word of our Lord was made to Abram by a vision saying: Feare not Abram, I am thy protector, & thy reward exceeding great. <sup>2</sup> And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou geue me? I shal goe without children: and the sonne of the stuard of my house is this Damascus Eliezer. <sup>3</sup> And Abram added: But to me thou hast not geuen seede: and loe my seruant borne in my house, shal be my heire. <sup>4</sup> And immediatly the word of our Lord came to him saying: He shal not be thy heyre: but he that shal come out of thy wombe, him shalt thou haue thin heire. <sup>5</sup> And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Looke vp to heauen, and number the starres, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shal thy seed be. <sup>6</sup> Abram
