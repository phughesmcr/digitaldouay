ANNOTATIONS.  
CHAP. XXI.

<aside>Separation to be made in families, when iust cause requireth.</aside>

11. *Let it not*] It semed so hard, inhumaine, and vniust to cast Agar and Ismael out of the house, that Abraham would not haue done it, vnles God had commanded him in this to heare the voice of Sara. But when he knew Gods wil therin, not respecting flesh and bloud, nor disputing further of the lawfulnes of the fact, sent them both away, commending them to Gods protection: (so by this separation the familie was made quiet. It represented also a notable Mysterie of the Synagog of the Iewes & Church of Christ. As S. Augustin doth excellently expound the same, according to S. Paul (Gal. 4.) That Ismael playing with Isaac was persecution, because it tended to peruert him, shewing it to be a greater iniurie, to delude and deceiue anie, in drawing them to new and particular companies, then corporally to persecute them: and that the Church, and Catholique Princes punish heretikes for their good, to make them returne to the truth, or finally to cease from seducing others. *Ecce libera affligit ancillam, & non illam vocat persecutionem Apostolus, ludit seruus cum domino, & persecutionem vocat. Afflictio ista non vocatur persecutio, & lusus ille vocatur persecutio*. Behold the freewoman afflicted the handmaide, and the Apostle calleth it not persecution, the seruant playeth with the master, and he calleth it persecution. This affliction is not called persecution, and that play is called persecution. Againe, he sayeth of Sara, *Eiiciam eam, & non dixit persequar eam*. She the freewoman said, I wil cast her out, she said not, I wil persecute her. S. Hierom also teacheth that the spiritual neuer persecuteth the carnal: but spareth him as his natural brother, hoping that he may in time be profitable.

<aside>Mystical sense

The true Church doth not persecute but iustly punish obstinate offenders.

Heretikes and other infidels do persecute when either by word, or sword they impugne the truth.</aside>
