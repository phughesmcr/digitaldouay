<sup>18</sup> And Moyses going forth from Pharaoes sight, prayed to our Lord: <sup>19</sup> who made a very vehement wind to blow from the west, and taking the locustes it threw them into the Red sea: there remained not so much as one in al the coastes of Aegypt. <sup>20</sup> And our Lord did indurate Pharaoes hart, neither did he dismisse the children of Israel. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Stretch for thy hand toward heauen: and be there darkenesse vpon the Land of Aegypt so thicke, that it be palpable. <sup>22</sup> And Moyses stretched forth his hand toward heauen: and there was made horrible darkenesse in the whole Land of Aegypt three dayes. <sup>23</sup> No man saw his brother, nor moued himselfe out of the place where he was: but wheresoeuer the children of Israel dwelt, there was light. <sup>24</sup> And Pharao called Moyses and Aaron, and said to them: Goe sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheepe only, and heardes remaine, let your litle ones goe with you. Moyses said: Hostes also & holocaustes thou shalt geue to vs, which we may offer to the Lord our God. <sup>25</sup> Al the flockes shal goe with vs: there shal not a hoofe remaine of them: the which are necessarie vnto the seruice of the Lord our God: especially wheras we know not what must be offered, til we come to the very place. <sup>27</sup> And our Lord did indurate Pharaoes hart, and he would not dismisse them. <sup>28</sup> And Pharro said to Moyses: Gette thee from me, and beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soeuer thou shalt come in my sight, thou shalt dye. <sup>29</sup> Moyses answered: So shal it be as thou hast spoken, I wil not see thy face any more.

<sup>1</sup> AND our Lord said to Moyses: Yet with one plague more wil I touch Pharao & Aegypt, and after this he shal dismisse you, and compel you to goe forth. <sup>2</sup> Thou shalt say therefore to al the people that euerie man aske of his frend, & euery woman of her neighbour vessels of siluer, & of gold. <sup>3</sup> And the Lord wil geue grace to his people in the sight of the Aegyptians. And Moyses was a very great man in the Land of Aegypt,
