And behold one, that had escaped, told Abram the Hebrew, that dwelt in the vale of Mambre, the Amorrean brother of Eschol, and the brother of Aner: <sup>14</sup> for these had made a league with Abram.

CHAP. XIII.

[^1] Melchisedech] S. Hierom being earnestly requested by Euagrius, to geue his iudgement touching Melchisedech, whom a nameles author had endeuored to proue to be the Holie Ghost, plainly confuteth that error: as also an other error of Origen and Didymus saying, he was an Angel. Likewise S. Epiphanius (heres. 55. & 76) relateth and condemneth a third error, of some that thought him to be the Sonne of God. These two Fathers, and S. Augustin (li. de heresibus her. 34.) and diuers others, whom S. Hierom alleageth proue euidently, that he was a very man, a Priest and a king, yea the high Priest (at least of that countrie) Superior to Abraham, and a figure of Christ besides.
