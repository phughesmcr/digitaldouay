manded thee, that thou shouldest not eate, cursed is the earth in thy worke: with much toiling shalt thou eate thereof al the daies of thy life. <sup>18</sup> Thornes and thystles shal it bring forth to thee, & thou shalt eate the herbes of the earth. <sup>19</sup> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread, til thou returne to earth, of which thou wast taken: because dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt returne.

<aside>Why hath God?</aside>

1 *Why hath God?* Here we may see how sinne came first amongst men. For Sinne entred the diuel hauing most happie life attempted Eue the weaker person, beginning with a question, therby to allure her into conference, and by such a question as might bring her into suspition of Gods affection towards man, saying: *Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eate of euerie tree of paradise?* insi nuating by these words, and withal interally suggesting, that God dealt hard ly with them, abridging their libertie without cause. And when he had got so much of her, that she was displeased with the precept, which she shewed by Eue first an adding of her owne (to make it seme more grieuous) that they were forbidden swered to touch the tree, and againe by reporting the punishment as doubtful, saying: then in words *lest perhaps we dye*, then the tempter auouched boldly, and falsly, that they list in deedes should not dye, and charged God to be enuious of the benefite they should get should not dye. by eating of that tree, saying *their eyes should be opened, and they should be as Goddes, knowing good and euil*. Vpon which perswasion, and liking also she had to the fruite, she did eate, and perswaded Adam also to eate. And forth with they saw that they would not haue seene, knew euil which they had better not to haue knowen, were ashamed, and endeuoured to couer, and hide them selues. Euen thus the diuel dealeth with al men euer since, assaulting the weaker person, and weaker part, as the flesh and sensualitie, and by them (fetch vpon the stronger and superior part, to get consent of freewil, without which there is no sinne. According to that famous saying of S. Augustin: *Peccatum adeo est be without voluntarium, vt nullo modo sit peccatum, si non sit voluntarium. Sinne is so voluntarie, that freewil.
