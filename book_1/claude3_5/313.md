30 nacle of testimonie: <sup>†</sup> who shal make one for sinne, and the other for an holocaust, and he shal pray for her before our
31 Lord, and for the fluxe of her vncleannesse. <sup>†</sup> You shal teach therfore the children of Israel, that they take heede of vn- [^1]
cleannesse, and die not in their filthiness, when they shal pol-
32 lute my tabernacle that is among them. <sup>†</sup> This is the law
of him that hath the fluxe of sede and that is polluted by co-
33 pulation, <sup>†</sup> and the woman that is separated in her menstrual
times, or that hath a continual fluxe of bloud, and of the man,
that sleepeth with her.

CHAP. XVI.

*When and how the high Priest must enter into the Sanctuarie. 14. How he shal expiate (or reconcile) the same, 16. and the Tabernacle, 18. and the Altar. 20. How he shal offer a liue goate, and send him into the wildernes. 29. And al must celebrate the feast of expiation, or clensing from sinnes.*

shal hide his priuities with linnen femorales: he shal be gir-
ded with a linnen girdle, a linnen mitre shal he put vpon his
head: for these are holie vestmentes: withal which, when he

whole multitude of the children of Israel two bucke goates
6 for sinne, and one ramme for an holocaust. <sup>†</sup> And when
he hath offered the calfe, and praied for him self, and for his

9 an other for the goate of dismission: <sup>†</sup> that, whose lotte fel to
10 the Lord, he shal offer for sinne: <sup>†</sup> but that, whose lotte was
