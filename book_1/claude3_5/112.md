like places of Scripture. As when our Sauiour said of S. Iohn Baptist (Math. 11.) *He is Elias*, meaning that he was Elias in spirit, not in person. So Iacob said truly that he was Esau, not meaning in person but in right of the first borne, by Gods ordinance: Esau also hauing condescended therto by couenant and oath. In this also he deceiued his father, was no sinne. For it was a lawful and good deceipt, such a one (saith S. Chrisostom) as Hieremie speaketh of, *Lord thou hast deceiued me, and I was deceiued*. So Isaac was deceiued, not as we did commonly cal deceipt, but to his owne and others good, by Gods disposition.

<aside>Some deceipt good.</aside>

[^1] S. Damasus demanding of S. Hierom, what might be the reason why God would suffer his holie seruant Isaac not to know Iacob, but to be deceiued, and through ignorance to blesse whom he would not, declareth that it happened not only to Iacob, but also to manie other like holie men, to be ignorant of manie things, and to be deceiued in error of opinion: and that this error was profitable to Isaac and his house. For if he had giuen this blessing (which was a spiritual iurisdiction) to Esau, as he purposed, he had committed a noxious error in dede, by preferring a bloudie man, one that was readie, if he could, to haue killed his brother. (*v. 41.*) omitting him, that was sincere and very vertuous, and had done his owne wil, not Gods wil therin.

<aside>It was good that Isaac knew not Iacob when he blessed him.</aside>

But why would not God reuel his wil to Isaac (as he had commanded a farre greater thing to Abraham to sacrifice the same Isaac) that he might wittingly haue blessed Iacob by Gods commandment? The Fathers do probably alleage this for one reason, that if Esau, being a fierce and cruel man, had perceiued that his father had willingly preferred Iacob, he would haue bene incensed against his father, conceiued and attempted euil against him. An other reason S. Chrisostom and Theodoret do yeld, that by this strange maner of imparting this blessing, it might more manifestly appeare to be Gods wil and ordinance, and not to procede from mans affection, that Iacob should be preferred.

<aside>Good in respect of Esau.</aside>

CHAP. XXVIII.

*Iacob with his fathers blessing, and admonition not to take a wife of Chanaan, but of the daughters of his vncle Laban, goeth into Mesopotamia: (6. Esau in the meane time marieth a third wife, his vncle Ismaels daughter) 11. Iacob seeth in sleepe a ladder reaching to heauen, Angels ascending and descending, and our Lord leaning theron renewed the promises made to Abraham and Isaac. 16. And he awaking maketh a vow.*

<sup>1</sup> ISAAC therfore called Iacob, and blessed him, and commanded him saying: Take not a wife of the stocke of Chanaan: <sup>2</sup> but goe, and make a iourney into Mesopotamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel thy mothers father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thin vncle. <sup>3</sup> And God almightie blesse thee, and make thee encrease
