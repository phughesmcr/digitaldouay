foreward from thence he digged an other wel, for which
they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof,
Latitude, saying: Now hath our Lord dilated vs, and made
<sup>23</sup> vs to encrease vpon the earth. And he went vp from that
<sup>24</sup> place vnto Bersabee, where our Lord appeared to him
that same night, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father, do not feare, because I am with thee: I wil blesse thee,
and multiplie thy seed for my seruant Abrahams sake.
<sup>25</sup> Therefore he builded there an altar: and hauing called
vpon the name of our Lord, he pitched his tent: and com-
<sup>26</sup> manded his seruants that they should digge a wel. To the
which place when there were come from Gerara Abimelech,
and Ocozath his freind, and Phicol chiefe captaine of his
<sup>27</sup> souldiers, Isaac spake to them: Why are ye come to me a
<sup>28</sup> man whom you hated, and haue thrust out from you? Who
answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore
we said: Let there be an oath between vs, and let vs make a
<sup>29</sup> league, that thou do vs no harme, as we also haue touched nothing of thine, neither haue we done that which
might hurt thee: but with peace haue we dismissed thee encrea-
<sup>30</sup> sed with the blessing of the Lord. Therefore he made
<sup>31</sup> them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunken arising
in the morning, they sware one to an other: and Isaac dis-
<sup>32</sup> missed them peaceably into their place. And behold the
same day came the seruants of Isaac telling him of a wel,
which they had digged, and saying: We haue found water.
<sup>33</sup> Wherupon he called it Abundance: and the name of
the citie was geuen Bersabee, euen vnto this present day.
<sup>34</sup> But Esau being fourtie yeares old married wiues, Iudith
the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daugh-
<sup>35</sup> ter of Elon of the same place: both which had :: offended
the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.

<aside>:: Esau by marying against his parents wil, made breach from them.</aside>

[^1] These were not the same ceremonies and lawes which
