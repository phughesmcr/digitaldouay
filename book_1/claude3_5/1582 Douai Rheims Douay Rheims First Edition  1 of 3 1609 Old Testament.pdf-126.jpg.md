<aside>Iacobs feare was iust, and by Gods promise, confirmed in his manie blessings, prouided in al former dangers, accompanied the night before with armies of Angels, indued also with al vertues, and namely with perfect charitie (which expelleth feare) he was for al this so vehemently afraid</aside>

<aside>Iacob wrestled with an Angel corporally & spiritually.</aside>

7. *Feared excedingly*] Iustly may we meruel, why Iacob so often assured S. Augustin answereth, that he neither 4.102.in distrusted in God, nor did anie vnlawful thing: but did his owne endeuour Gen. wisely and confidently, lest by presuming or desparing he should rather haue tempted God, then trusted in him. The causes of his feare were in respect of him selfe and his brother. For considering Gods former promises, benefites & protection were not to be presumed as absolute fauors of his perpetual loue, but conditional, if him selfe perseured sincerly in Gods seruice. And seing *the wil man knoweth not whether he be worthie of loue, or of hatred*, he might Eccle. 9. doubt, lest by his twentie yeares conuersation among Infidels in Mesopotamia, he had contracted some sinnes, for which God might suffer him to fall into calamitie and affliction. And though he was in dede ful more and more vertuous, and consequently in Gods more fauour and protection: yet so much the more, by how much lesse he presumed of his owne good state and merites: yet by the vehement apprehending of his brothers inclination to reuenge, the greatnes of the occasion by procuring the first-birth-right, and his fathers blessing from him, the newes of his speedie coming towards him with foure hundred men, the natural situation of the place, where Esau might easily inuiron him, and (as he humbly thought) his owne vnworthines, he was possessed with natural feare (such as happeneth to constant men) and was fore afflicted for the tender care of his familie. But reflecting vpon Gods goodnes, he prudently disposed of his people and flockes, and besought God to protect him and his, by prayer qualified with requisite conditions, to wit, with humilitie, not asking for his owne merites, but for *Abraham and Isaac* sake, and for Gods owne promise, acknowledging himselfe to be *lesse then al mercies* towards him, with grateful recognising great benefites receiued, saying: *With my staffe I passed ouer this Iordan, and now with two troupes I do returne*, with confidence in that God had said, he *would dilate his sede as the sand of the sea*, and with meeknes in forgiuing offenses and good wordes to Esau. Thus finally he pacified him, and so his owne feare was turned into ioy.

24. *A man wrestled*] This wrestling with an Angel assuming a bodie in forme of a man was corporal, as the effect shewed in Iacobs sinow shrunke vp, which made him to halt. v. 25. & 31. It was also spiritual, as appeareth by Osee. 12. his earnest praier and at last obtayning the Angels blessing. S. Dionys. c. 4. cel. Hierar. S. Greg. praefat. in Iob. Theoderet, q. 91. in Gen.
