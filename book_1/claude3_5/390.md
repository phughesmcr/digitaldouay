<sup>25</sup> Nothing is flooded in the streictes of two walles, wherwith vineyardes were inclosed. Whom the asse seeing, ioyned her selfe close to the wal, and brused the foote of him that ridde. But he beate her againe: <sup>26</sup> and neuerthelesse the Angel passing to a narrow place, where there could be no going a side neither to the right hand nor to the left, stoode to meete him. <sup>27</sup> And when the asse had seene the Angel standing, she fel vnder the feete of the rider. Who being angrie, bette her sides with a staffe more vehemently. <sup>28</sup> And our Lord opened the mouth of the asse, and she spake: What haue I done to thee? why strikest thou me? loe now the third time. <sup>29</sup> Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserued, and hast mocked me: I would I had a sword, that I might kil thee. <sup>30</sup> The asse said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast beene alwayes accustomed to ride vntil this present day? tel me what like thing did I euer to thee. But he said: Neuer. <sup>31</sup> Forthwith our Lord opened the eies of Balaam, and he saw the Angel standing in the way with a drawen sword, and he adored him flatte to the ground. <sup>32</sup> To whom the Angel said: Why beatest thou thy asse the third time? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is peruerse, and contrarie to me: <sup>33</sup> and vnlesse the asse had turned out of the way, geuing place to me resisting thee, I had slaine thee, and she should haue liued. <sup>34</sup> Balaam said: I haue sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I goe, I wil returne. <sup>35</sup> The Angel said: Goe with these men, and see thou speake no other thing then I shal command thee. He went therfore with the princes. <sup>36</sup> Which when Balac heard, he came forth to meete him in a towne of the Moabites, that is situated in the vttermost borders of Arnon. <sup>37</sup> And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to cal thee, why didst thou not come imme­diately vnto me? was it because I can not reward thy coming? <sup>38</sup> To whom he answered: Loe here I am: Shal I be able to speake any other thing, but that which God shal put in my mouth? <sup>39</sup> They therfore went on together, and came into a citie, that was in the vttermost borders of his kingdome. <sup>40</sup> And when Balac had killed oxen, & sheepe, he sent therof to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him, presentes. <sup>41</sup> And when morning was come, he brought him to the ex­celles of Baal, and he beheld the vttermost part of the people.

<aside>Nothing is here to be more instruc­ted (sayth S. Augustine) then that he was not afraide whe he heard his asse speake vnto him. But being accusto­med to such monstrous things he re­plied famili­arly, nothing therewith a­stonished.</aside>

<aside>Yet seing an Angel, he fel downe terri­fied, and ado­red him. v. 31.</aside>

<aside>Balaam kno­wing him to be an Angel that appeared, neither ado­red him with diuine honour as God, nor with ciuil, as a mortal man, but with reli­gious honour, lesse then di­uine, & more then ciuil. see Exod. 20.</aside>

<aside>God some­times maketh false prophe­tes to vtter a truth, because preiudicate mindes do ra­ther geue eare to such, the to true prophe­tes. Theod. q. 45. in Num.</aside>
