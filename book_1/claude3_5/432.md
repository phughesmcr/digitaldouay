# Deuteronomie.

<sup>30</sup> Goe and say to them: Returne into your tentes. <sup>31</sup> But thou stand here with me, and I wil speake to thee al my commandementes, and ceremonies and judgementes: which thou shalt teach them, that they may doe them in the Land, which I wil geue them in possession. <sup>32</sup> Keepe therfore and doe the thinges which our Lord God hath commanded you: you shal not decline neither to the right hand, nor to the left: <sup>33</sup> but the way that the Lord your God hath commanded shal you walke, that you may liue, and it may be wel with you, and your daies may be prolonged in the land of your possession.

## ANNOTATIONS.

### CHAP. V.

<aside>Images of I- dols forbid, but not of other thinges.</aside>

3. *Thou shalt not make.*] If our aduersaries would quietly consider the co- herence of the holie text, they might easely see, that this prohibition of making, and worshipping the similitude of anie creature, pertaineth to the former sentence: *Thou shalt not haue strange goddes:* more particularly forbidding either to make Idoles, or to worship such as others make; and that with com- mination, because our Lord is a ielous God, and wil not suffer his honour to be geuen to anie creature. But other Images were made in the old Testa- ment, by Gods commandment, and likewise Images of Christ and his Sainctes are lawful and profitable among Christians: as before is noted. *Exod. 20.*

### CHAP. VI.

*God is diligently to be serued, and loued with thy whole hart, thy whole soule, and whole strength. Al his preceptes, ceremonies and iudgements must be carefully kept, and commended to posteritie.*

<sup>1</sup> THESE are the preceptes, and ceremonies, and judge- mentes, which the Lord your God commanded that I should teach you, and you should doe them in the Land, whereunto you passe ouer to possesse it: <sup>2</sup> that thou mayest feare the Lord thy God, and keepe his commandementes and preceptes, which I command thee, and thy sonnes, and ne- phewes, al the dayes of thy life, that thy dayes may be pro- longed. <sup>3</sup> Heare Israel, and obserue that thou doe the thinges which our Lord hath commanded thee, and it may be wel with thee, and thou mayest be greatly multiplied, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee a land flowing with milke and honie. <sup>4</sup> Heare Israel, The Lord our God, is one Lord. <sup>5</sup> Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with thy whole hart, and with thy whole soule, and with thy whole strength.
