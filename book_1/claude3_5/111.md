# GENESIS.

## ANNOTATIONS.
### CHAP. XXVII.

<sup>19</sup> I am thy first begotten Esau.] Iacob was not by nature the first begotten; but by Gods ordinance, & by couenant made with Esau, had right to the preeminence, and priuilegies belonging to the first borne. So he did not lie, but spake a truth, meaning that he was that sonne, to whom by diuine election the first-birth-right was dew, which his father supposed to pertaine to Esau.

But because some scorners of Christian doctrin (like to the old Manichees) vse to say, that Catholique Doctors, and Schoolmen excuse, and condemne whom they list by such glosses, let such reprouers vnderstand, that both moderne and ancient Catholique writers avow this defence of the holie Patriarch Iacob, not by priuate spirite, but by the most true and proper sense of holie Scripture itselfe. Where it may appeare, if they wil examine the text, that Iacob in al this procurement of his fathers blessing, neither did anie thing vniustly, nor said anie thing falsly. First it was reueled to his mother (chap. 25. v. 23.) *That the elder* (of her twinnes) *should serue the yonger*. Secondly, holie Scripture testifieth in the same chapter (v. 27.) *That Iacob was a plaine* (or sincere) *Man, void of vniust dealing*. Thirdly, for more quiet enioying that right, which God had ordained for him, he procured his brothers consent and confirmation (v. 33) Fourtly though he was secure in conscience that the blessing was dew to him, yet he feared (v. 12.) lest he might geue occasion of offence to his father, to whom this mysterie was not yet reueled. Fiftly Isaac perceiuing at last Gods wil, that Iacob should be preferred, was neither offended with him, nor reuoked his blessing, as vnlawfully surprised, but condescending therto, ratified that he had done, saying (v. 33.) *I haue blessed him, and he shal be blessed*. Sixtly, God himselfe from this time forwards often appeared to Iacob, and with great promises, and manie temporal and spiritual benefites, declared his singular loue to him. Seuenthly, these three Patriarches Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob are special renowned Sainctes of the old Testament: yea the Lord and Creator of al would peculiarly be called (Exodi. 3.) the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Moyses praying instantly for Gods mercie and clemencie towards the people (Exodi. 32.) besought him to remember Abraham Isaac, and Iacob his seruants: and so in both old and new Testament these three are often mentioned as chiefe Princes in the Kingdom of Heauen. Al which shewes the great vertues and holines of them al.

And touching this fact of Iacob, where (if euer aniewhere) might seme to be some great sinne. S. Augustin at large proueth that he did not herein sinne at al: *That which Iacob did* (saith he, li. cont. mendacium c. 10.) *by his mothers instruction to deceiue his father, if it be diligently considered, was no lie, but a mysterie, and therfore for the familiar counsel of the Holie Ghost, which his mother had receiued, he is excused from sinne*. The same he confirmeth. q. 74. in Gen. li. 16. c. 37. de ciuit. & li. 22. c. 34 cont. Faust. The same teach S. Chrisostom ho. 53 in Gen. S. Hierom Epist. 125. S. Theodoret. q. 79. & 80. in Gen. S. Gregorie, ho. 6. in Ezechielem. S. Bede, Isidorus, Innocentius 3. Rupertus and others vpon this place, al agreing absolutly that euerie lie is a sinne, declare that Iacob lied not, but spake the truth, confirming their exposition by other like examples in holie Scripture.

[^1]: Iacob did not lie, nor sinne in saying he was Esau. &c.
