though they wanted not other sufficient corporal foode. Againe the wordes
folowing *For he was the Priest of God most high*, can haue no other sense, but
that he did the function of a Priest in the bread & wine which he brought,
otherwise if the only cause of bringing that prouision had benne to releue the
campe with victuals, the reason would rather haue benne yelded, because he
was a bountiful King, a liberal Prince, a special freind to Abram, as in deede
he was, but none of these reasons, or the like fitted this purpose so wel, nor
touched the cause of bringing forth bread and wine, as to signifie that he was
a Priest, whose office is to offer Sacrifice.

Here againe some Protestants take exception against the Latin text, that the
causal coniunction *Enim*, *for*, is not agreable to the Hebrew, but should be
the copulatiue *Et*, *and*, which is a meere wrangling. For the lerned know wel
ynough, that the Hebrew particle is better expressed in such places, by *Enim*
or, *quia*, *for* or *because*, then by &: And so the English Bible printed in the yeare
of our Lord. 1552, readeth : *Melchisedech king of Salem brought forth bread and
wine: for he was the Priest of the most highest God*. The later Editions also in like
places haue not the copulatiue *And*, but some other word as the sense requireth. Gen. 20. v. 3. *Thou art but a dead man, for the woman's sake which thou hast
taken: for she is a mans wife*. where the Hebrew phrase is, *And she is maried to an
husband*. Gen. 30. v. 27. they read thus : *For I haue proued that the Lord hath blessed
me for thy sake*, where precisely construing the Hebrew they should say, *I diuined*
(or coniectured) *and the Lord blessed me for thy sake*. Likewise Esaie, 64. v. 5.
they read : *But Loe, thou hast bene angrie, for we offended*, the Hebrew is thus.
*Loe thou art angrie, and we haue sinned*. In the same place, they translate, *Yet shal
we be saued*, which the Hebrew expresseth by the copulatiue, *And we shal be
saued*. So when they thinke it conuenient, they translate the Hebrew particle,
*For*, *that*, *yet*, which strictly signifieth *And*.

Now let vs also see the original in this place. In the Hebrew it is thus:
<sup>18</sup>VMALCHI TSEDEC MELEC SHALEM HOTSI LECHEM VAIAIN.
<sup>19</sup>VHV COHEN LEEL ELION. VAIE VARECHIHV &c. In English
word for word thus : *And Melchisedech king of Salem brought forth bread and wine.
And he the priest to God most high. And he blessed him*, &c. where albeit the causal word *For*, is not expressed, yet these wordes, *And he the priest*, further declaring that besides the office and dignitie of a King (which was said before)
Melchisedech was also a Priest, must nedes signifie that he did something about
the bread and wine belonging to a Priests office. And what that something
was, perhaps the Vniuersitie of Cambridge wil testifie, whose late professor
of Diuinitie teacheth plainly, that Melchisedech offered Sacrifice, and was
therin a figure of Christ (*Pag. 76. de probat. Sacrament*.) (saith he) *Fuit eo tempore
sacerdos, qui sacrificia faciebat, qualis fuit Aaron, & Aaronis filij. & Melchisedechvs, &
quem illi adumbrabant, Christus. Priestes truly and properly are they, that offer sacrifices,
such as was Aaron, and the sonnes of Aaron, and Melchisedech, and Christ, whom they
prefigured*. If then both Aaron & Melchisedech were truly and properly Priests,
because they offered sacrifices (according to this Professors definition) and
both were figures of Christ, it must nedes be granted that as Christ fulfilled
the figure of Aarons bloudie sacrifices, in offering him selfe vpon the Crosse :
so he also fulfilled the figure as wel of vnbloudie sacrifices of Aaron, as especially of Melchisedeches Sacrifice in some other besides that on the Crosse, (seing
the prophet Dauid and S. Paul say, Christ is a Priest (not according to Aarons
order, for that was to haue an end, but) *For euer* according to the order of
Melchisedech . And what other Sacrifice did our Sauiour offer to remaine
