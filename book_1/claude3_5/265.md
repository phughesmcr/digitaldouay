EXODVS.

<sup>30</sup> And when the next day was come, Moyses spake to the people: You haue sinned a verie great sinne: I wil goe vp to our Lord, if by anie meanes I may be able to intreate him for your sinful fact. <sup>31</sup> And returning to our Lord, he said: I beseech thee: this people hath sinned a heinous sinne, and they haue made to them selues goddes of gold: either forgiue them this trespasse, <sup>32</sup> or if thou doe not, strike me out of the booke that thou hast written. <sup>33</sup> To whom our Lord answered: He that hath sinned to me, him wil I strike out of my booke: <sup>34</sup> but goe thou, and leade this people whi- ther I haue told thee: myne Angel shal goe before thee. And I in the day of reuenge wil visite this sinne also of theirs. <sup>35</sup> Our Lord therfore smote the people for the fault concer- ning the calfe, which Aaron had made.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXXII.

[^1] *A molten calfe*] No other reason can be imagined, why the people falling to Idolatrie, required the image of a calfe, rather then of anie other thing, but for that they thought the blacke calfe with white spottes, called *Apis*, or *Serapis*, whom they sawe the Ægyptians estemed most of al their goddes, to be the chiefe, or onlie God. And therfore of this famous Idoly they ascribed the benefite of their deliuerie from bondage, saying: *These are thy goddes, o Israel, that haue brought thee out of the Land of Ægypt*. So they meant not to worship our Lord, the true God, in that image, as Caluin would haue it, but the very calfe whose image it was, for adoring immediatly the calues image, *and immolating hostes to it* (v. 8.) they professed that to be their God, which the image represented. This appeareth also, Deut. 32. v. 18. *God that begat thee thou hast forsaken: and hast forgotten our Lord thy creatour*. And Psal. 105. v. 21. *They forgat God, which saued them*.

[^2] *Moyses besought*.] Albeit Moyses with most humble submission prayed for the people, which God so accepted, that he was therby pacified, [v 14.] yet Caluin here condemneth him of arrogancie, and pride, as though he imperiously prescribed law to God, repelling him of his iustice. Much otherwise S. Hierom (*Epist. 12. ad Gaud*.) commending his feruent charitie, doubteth not to say, *Dei potentiam serui precibus impediri*: *The seruantes prayers hindered Gods power*, because God himself saying, *Suffer me, that my furie may be angrie against them, and that I may destroy them*: sheweth diuine prouidence to be such, as *he might be staied, from doing that which he threatned*.

[^3] *Remember Abraham*.] It much troubled Caluin, that for obtaining pardon for the people, the Patriarches are mentioned, for whose sake and merites, mercie, and protection was promised by God (Gen. 18. 12. 26.) prophesied by Iacob, (Gen. 48.) performed here, and in manie other places. And it is a vaine cauilation to say: God shewed his mercie for his promise sake only: for he promised the same for their merites; as appeareth in the places alleaged. Though al merites procede from Gods grace, first geuen without merites. 1. Cor. 4. v. 7. S. Aug. de gra. & lib. arb. n. 6.

<aside>Moyses not content with his owne saluation, would rather perish with the people, then they should al be destroyed: and therfore thus instance God pardoned them. S. Hiero. Ep. 12. ad Gaud. & in Ezec. 13. & Gaud. & in Ezec. T. 5. Aug. q. 147. in Exod.</aside>
