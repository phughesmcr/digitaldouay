<sup>14</sup> caried them vnto thy holie habitation.

<sup>15</sup> Nations rose vp, and were angrie: sorowes possessed the inhabiters of Philisthijm. Then were the princes of Edom trubled, trembling ceazed on the sturdie of Moab: al the inhabiters of Chanaan were starke. Let feare and dread fal vpon them, in the greatnes of thy arme: let them become vnmoue-able as a stone, vntil thy people ô Lord shal passe, vntil thy people shal passe, this which thou hast possessed.

<sup>17</sup> Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountaine of thy inheritance, in thy most firme habitation, which thou hast wrought ô Lord: thy sanctuarie Lord, which thy handes haue confirmed.

<sup>18</sup> Our Lord shal reigne for euer and euermore.

<sup>19</sup> For Pharao on horsebake entred in with his chariottes and horsemen into the sea: and our Lord brought backe vpon them the waters of the sea: but the children of Israel walked on drie ground in the middes therof.

<sup>20</sup> Marie therefore the prophetesse, Aarons sister, tooke[^1] a tymbrelin her hand: and al the wemen went forth after her with tymbrels and daunces,

<sup>21</sup> to whom she beganne the song, saying: Let vs sing to our Lord, for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and his rider he hath cast into the sea.

<sup>22</sup> And Moyses remoued Israel from[^2] the red sea, and they went forth into the desert Sur: and they walked three dayes through the wildernesse, and found not water.

<sup>23</sup> And they came into Mara, neither could they drinke the waters of Mara, because they were bitter: wherupon he gaue a name also agreable to the place, calling it Mara, that is, bitternesse.

<sup>24</sup> And the people murmured against Moyses, saying: What shal we drinke?

<sup>25</sup> But he cried to our Lord, who did shew him[^3] a peece of woode: which when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into swetenesse. There he appoin-ted him preceptes, and iudgements, and there he proued him,

<sup>26</sup> saying: If thou wilt heare the voice of the Lord thy God, and doe that is right before him, and obey his com-mandements, and keepe al his preceptes, none of the mala-dies, that I layd vpon Ægypt, wil I bring vpon thee: for I am the Lord God thy curer.

<sup>27</sup> And the children of Israel came into Elim, where there were twelue fountaines of water, & seuentie palme trees: and they camped beside the waters.
