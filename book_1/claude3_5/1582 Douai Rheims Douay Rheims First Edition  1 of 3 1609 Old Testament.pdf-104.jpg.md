<sup>23</sup>Two nations are in thy wombe, and two peoples shal be diuided out of thy wombe, and one people shal overcome the other, and "the elder shal serue the younger." <sup>24</sup>Now her time was come to be deliuered, and behold twinnes were found in her wombe. <sup>25</sup>He that came forth first, was read, and al hearie in manner of a skinne: and his name was called Esau. <sup>26</sup>Immediatly the other coming forth, held his brothers plant in his hand: and therefore he called him Iacob. Threescore yeres old was Isaac, when the litle ones were borne vnto him. <sup>27</sup>Who being growne vp, Esau became a man cunning in hunting, and a husband man: but Iacob a plaine man dwelled in tents. <sup>28</sup>Isaac loued Esau, because he did eate of his hunting: and Rebecca loued Iacob. <sup>29</sup>And Iacob boyled broth: to whom Esau being come faynt out of the field, <sup>30</sup>said: Geue me of this read broth, because I am exceeding faint. For which cause his name was called Edom. <sup>31</sup>To whom Iacob said: "Sel me thy first-birth-right." <sup>32</sup>He answered, Loe I dye, what wil the first birth right auaile me? <sup>33</sup>Iacob said: Sweare therfore to me. Esau sware to him, and sould his first-birth-right. <sup>34</sup>And so taking bread and the rice broth, did eate, and drinke, and went his way; litle esteeming that he had sold his first birth right.

ANNOTATIONS.  
CHAP. XXV.

<aside>Why Agar & Cetura being lawful wiues are called concubines. Their childre signified Paganes & Heretikes.</aside>

*6. To the children of his concubines*] S. Augustin (li. 16. c. 34. de ciuit) proueth that both Agar and Cetura, being Abrahams lawful wiues (for so they are called in holie Scripture) are also called concubines, because they had not like priuileges to Sara, whose sonne was sole heyre to his father, and the children of the others had only giftes (or mouable goods) not atteyning to the promised kingdom. And al this for mysterie sake. For Ismael signified the carnal people before Christ, the children of Cetura prefigured Heretikes, that oppose themselues to perteine to the new Testament, but are separated no lesse then the Iewes from Christs kingdom. And albeit there was also an other particular reason, why Agar was called concubine, because she was a second wife, the first then liuing, yet this learned father saith, he did not see, why Cetura being maried after the death of Sara, should be called concubine, but only for this Mysterie.
