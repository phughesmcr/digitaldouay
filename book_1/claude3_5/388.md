deuoured Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitantes of the
high places of Arnon. <sup>29</sup>Wo to thee Moab, thou art vndone
people of Chamos. He hath geuen his sonnes into flight,
and his daughters into captiuitie to Sehon the King of the
Amorrheites. <sup>30</sup>Their yoke is perished from Hesebon vnto
Dibon, they came wearie into Nophe, and vnto Medaba.
<sup>31</sup>Israel therfore dwelt in the Land of the Amorrheite.
<sup>32</sup>And Moyses sent some to take a view of Iazer: Whose vil-
lages they tooke, and possessed the inhabitantes. <sup>33</sup>And
they turned them selues, and went vp by the way of Basan,
and Og the King of Basan came against them with al his peo-
ple, to fight in Edrai. <sup>34</sup>And our Lord said to Moyses: Feare
him not, for into thy hand I haue deliuered him, and al his
people, and land: and thou shalt doe to him as thou didst to
Sehon the King of the Amorrheites, the inhabiter of He-
sebon. <sup>35</sup>They therfore smote him also with his sonnes, and
al his people vnto vtter destruction, and they possessed his
land.
