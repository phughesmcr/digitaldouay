may doe thee good: for our Lord hath promised good thinges <sup>30</sup> to Israel. To whom he answered: I wil not goe with thee, but I wil returne to my countrie, wherin I was borne. <sup>31</sup> And he said: Doe not forsake vs: for thou knowest in what places through the desert we may campe, and thou <sup>32</sup> shalt be our guide. And when thou comest with vs, what- soeuer shal be best of the riches, which our Lord shal deliuer <sup>33</sup> vs, we wil geue thee. They marched therfore from the Mount of our Lord three daies iourney, and the arke of the couenant of our Lord went before them, for three daies pro- <sup>34</sup> uiding a place for the campe. The cloude also of our Lord <sup>35</sup> was ouer them by day when they marched. And when the arke was lifted vp, Moyses said: Arise Lord, and be thyne enemies dispersed, and let them flee that hate thee, from thy <sup>36</sup> face. And when it was sette downe, he said: Returne Lord to the multitude of the hoste of Israel.

And the fire of our Lord being kinled against them, deuoured the vttermost part <sup>2</sup> of the campe. And when the people had cried to Moyses, <sup>3</sup> Moyses prayed to our Lord, and the fire was quenched. And he called the name of that place, Kindling: for that the fire of <sup>4</sup> our Lord had bene kindled against them. For the com- mon vulgar people, that came vp with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel being ioy- ned together with them, and said: Who shal geue vs flesh to <sup>5</sup> eate?
