the brest, and the fatte that is burnt on the altar, they haue 
eleuated before our Lord, and they pertaine to thee, and to 
thy sonnes by a perpetual lawe, as our Lord hath comman-
ded. <sup>16</sup>Among these thinges, when Moyses sought for the 
bucke goate, that had bene offered for sinne, he found it 
burnt: and being angrie against Eleazar, and Ithamar the 
sonnes of Aaron that remained, he said: <sup>17</sup>Why did you not 
eate the hoste for sinne, in a holie place, which is most Holie, 
and geuen to you, that you may beare the iniquitie of the 
multitude, and may pray for it in the sight of our Lord, <sup>18</sup>espe-
cially wheras of the bloud therof, there hath not bene caried 
within the holie places, and you ought to haue eaten it in 
the Sanctuarie, as it was commanded me? <sup>19</sup>Aaron answe-
red: This day hath bene offered the victime for sinne, and 
the holocaust before our Lord: and to me that is chanced 
which thou seest. how could I eate it, or please our Lord in 
ceremonies hauing :: a sorowful hart..? <sup>20</sup>Which when 
Moyses had heard, he was satisfied with his answere.

<aside>Natural grief of mind made Aaron both vnwilling to eate & lesse apt to complete al the ceremo-nies: to with-out sinne he omitted that pertained to his commodi-tie, offering it to God.</aside>

CHAP. XI.

The distinction of cleane and vncleane in beastes, fish, birdes, and other things. 
The third part Of things cle-ane and vncle-ane, with the maner of puri-fying: & other precepts mo-ral & iudicial.

<sup>1</sup>AND our Lord spake to Moyses and :: Aaron, saying: 
<sup>2</sup>Say to the children of Israel: These are the beasts 
which you ought to eate of al the liuing things of the earth. 
<sup>3</sup>Euerie one that hath the hoofe diuided, and cheweth the 
cudde among the cattel, you shal eate. <sup>4</sup>But whatsoeuer in 
dede cheweth the cudde, and hath an hoofe, but diuideth it 
not, as the camel, and others, that you shal not eate, and among 
the " vncleane you shal repute it. <sup>5</sup>Cherogril which chew-
eth the cudde, and diuideth not the hoofe, is vncleane. 
<sup>6</sup>The hare also: for that also cheweth the cudde, but diui-
deth not the hoofe. <sup>7</sup>And the swine: which though it diui-
deth the hoofe, cheweth not the cudde. <sup>8</sup>The flesh of these 
you shal not eate, nor touch their carcasses, because they are 
vncleane to you. <sup>9</sup>These are the thinges that brede in the 
waters, and which it is lawful to eate. Al that hath finnes, and 
scales, aswel in the sea, as in the riuers, and the pooles, you 
shal eate. <sup>10</sup>But whatsoeuer hath not finnes and scales, of 
those that moue and liue in the waters, shalbe vnto you ab-
hominable, <sup>11</sup>and execrable, their flesh you shal not eate,

<aside>Hitherto God reueled his Law to Moyses onlie, and by him to the people. Now also to Aaron after he was consecrated high Priest: yet not al-wayes, for Moyses was stil superior. chap. 13.14.15. 17. &c.</aside>
