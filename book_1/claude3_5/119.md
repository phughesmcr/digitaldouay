haue serued thee, and how great thy possession hath benne in my hands. <sup>30</sup> Thou hadest a smal thing before I came to thee, and now thou art made rich: and our Lord hath blessed thee at my comming in. It is reason therfore that once I prouide also for mine owne house. <sup>31</sup> And Laban said: What shal I geue thee? But he said: I wil nothing: but if thou wilt doe that which I demande, I wil fede, and kepe thy sheepe again. <sup>32</sup> Goe round about al thy flockes, and separate al the shepe of diuers colours, of speckled flyse: and what soeuer shal be russet and spotted, and of diuers colours, aswel in the shepe, as in the goates, shal be my wages. <sup>33</sup> And my iustice shal answer for me to morowe, before thee when the time of the bargaine shal come: and al that shal not be of diuers colours, and spotted, and russet, aswel in the shepe as in the goates, shal accuse me of theft. <sup>34</sup> And Laban said: I like wel that thou demandest. <sup>35</sup> And he separated the same day the shee goates, and the shepe, and the he goates, and the rammes of diuers colours, and spotted: and al the flocke of one coloure, that is of white and blacke flyse, he deliuered in the hand of his sonnes. <sup>36</sup> And he put a space of three dayes iourney betwixt him and his sonne in lawe, who fed the rest of his flocke. <sup>37</sup> Iacob therfore taking grene roddes of the poplare, and of the almond, and of the plaine trees, in part pilled them: and when the barkes were taken of, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whitnes: but the parts that were whole, remayned grene: and by this meanes the colour was made diuers. <sup>38</sup> And he put them in the troughes, where the water was poured out: that when the flockes should come to drinke, they might haue the roddes before their eyes, and in the sight of them conceaue. <sup>39</sup> And it came to passe that in the verie heate of the ramming, the shepe beheld the roddes, and brought forth spotted, and of diuers colours, and speckled. <sup>40</sup> And Iacob diuided the flocke, and put the roddes in the troughes before the eyes of the rammes: and al the white and the blacke were Labans: and the rest, Iacobs, when the flockes were separated one from the other. <sup>41</sup> Therfore when the ewes went to ramme, in the prime time, Iacob put the roddes in the troughes of water before the eyes of the rammes, and of the ewes, that in looking vpon them they might conceaue: <sup>42</sup> but when the later
