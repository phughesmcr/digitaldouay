<sup>4</sup> Also thou shalt not pitie in iudgement: If thou meete thy enemies oxe, or asse going astray, bring it backe to him. <sup>5</sup> If thou see the asse of him that hateth thee lye vnderneth his burden, thou shalt not passe by, but shalt lift him vp with the same. <sup>6</sup> Thou shalt not decline the poore mans iudgement. <sup>7</sup> A lye thou shalt auoide. The innocent and iust person thou shal not put to death: because I abhorre the impious man. <sup>8</sup> Neither shalt thou take bribes, which doe blind also the wise, and peruert the wordes of the iust. <sup>9</sup> The stranger thou shalt not molest. for you know the hartes of strangers: because your selues also were strangers in the Land of Ægypt. <sup>10</sup> Six yeares thou shalt sow thy ground, and shalt gather the corne therof. <sup>11</sup> But the seuenth yeare thou shalt let it alone, and make it to rest, that the poore of thy people may eate, and whatsoeuer shal be leift, let the beastes of the field eate it: so shalt thou doe in thy vineyard and thy oliuete. <sup>12</sup> Six dayes thou shalt worke: the seuenth day thou shalt cease, that thy oxe may rest and thine asse: and the sonne of thy handmaide may be refreshed, and the stranger. <sup>13</sup> Kepe al thinges that I haue said to you.

Thou shalt not boyle a kidde in the milke of his damme. <sup>20</sup> Behold I wil send myne Angel, which shal goe before thee, and keepe thee in thy iourney, and bring thee into the place that I haue prepared. <sup>21</sup> Obserue him, and heare his voice, neither doe thou thinke him one to be contemned: for he wil not forgeue when thou hast sinned, and
