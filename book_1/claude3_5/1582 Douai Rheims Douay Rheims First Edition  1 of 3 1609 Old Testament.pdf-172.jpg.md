The mourning of Egypt. <sup>12</sup> Therefore the sonnes of Iacob did as he commanded them: <sup>13</sup> and carying him into the Land of Chanaan, they buried him in the duble caue, which Abraham had bought with the field for a possession to burie in of Ephron the Hethite against Mambre. <sup>14</sup> And Ioseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and with al the traine, his father being buried. <sup>15</sup> After whose death, his brethren fearing, and talking one with an other: Lest perhaps he be mindful of the iniurie which he suffered; and requite vs al the euil that we haue done, <sup>16</sup> they aduertised him saying: Thy father commanded vs before he died, <sup>17</sup> that we should say thus much to thee in his wordes: I besech that thou forget the wicked fact of thy brethren, and the sinne & malice which they haue exercised against thee: we also desire thee, that to the seruants of the God of thy father thou remit this iniquitie. Whom when Ioseph had heard he wept. <sup>18</sup> And his brethren came to him: and adoring prostrate on the ground they said: We are thy seruants. <sup>19</sup> To whom he answered: Feare not: can we resist the wil of God? <sup>20</sup> You thought euil against me: but God turned that into good, that he might exalt me, as presently you see, and might saue many peoples. <sup>21</sup> Feare not: I wil feed you & your litle ones, and he comforted them, and spake gently & mildly. <sup>22</sup> And he dwelt in Egypt, with al his fathers house: and liued an hundred and tenne yeares. And he sawe the children of Ephraim vnto the third generation. Also the children of Machir the sonne of Manasses were borne in Iosephs knees. <sup>23</sup> Which thinges being done, he spake to his brethren: After my death God wil visite you, and wil make you goe vp out of this land, to the land which he sware to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. <sup>24</sup> And when he had adiured them and said: God wil visite you, "carie my bones with you out of this place: <sup>25</sup> he died, being an hundred and tenne yeares old. And being embawmed with spices, was put in a coffin in Egypt.

<aside>Mans wil, not God the cause of sinne.</aside>

[^1]: 20. *You thought euil.*] This plaine distinction sheweth, that sinne is wholly of the sinner; and that God hath no part therin, but turneth it to good. For those thinges which Iosephs brethren did against him, were occasions of his aduancement.
