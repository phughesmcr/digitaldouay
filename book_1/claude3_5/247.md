and told the people al the wordes of our Lord, and the iudgementes: and al the people answered with one voice: Al the wordes of our Lord, which he hath spoken we wil doe. <sup>4</sup> And Moyses wrote al the wordes of our Lord: and rising in the morning he builded an Altar at the foote of the mount, <sup>5</sup> & twelue titles according the twelue tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the children of Israel, and they offered holocaustes, and sacrificed pacifique victimes to our Lord, calues. <sup>6</sup> Moyses therfore tooke the halfe part of the bloud, and put it into bowles: and the residue he powred vpon the Altar. <sup>7</sup> And taking the volume of the couenant, he reade the people hearing it: Who said: Al thinges that our Lord hath spoken, we wil doe, and we wil be obedient. <sup>8</sup> And he tooke the bloud, and sprinkled it vpon the people, and said: "This is the bloud of the Couenant which our Lord hath made with you vpon al these wordes. <sup>9</sup> And there went vp Moyses and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seuentie of the ancientes of Israel: <sup>10</sup> and they saw the God of Israel: and vnder his feete as it were a worke of sapphirstone, and as the heauen, when it is clere. <sup>11</sup> Neither did he set his hand vpon those of the children of Israel, that retired farre of, and they saw God, and did eate, and drinke. <sup>12</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Come vp to me into the mount, and be there: and I wil geue thee tables of stone, and the law, and the commandementes which I haue written: that thou maist teach them. <sup>13</sup> Moyses rose vp, and his minister Iosue: and Moyses ascending into the mount of God, <sup>14</sup> said to the Ancientes: Expect here til we returne to you, you haue Aaron and Hur with you: If anie question shal rise, you shal referre it to them. <sup>15</sup> And when Moyses was ascended, a cloud couered the mount, <sup>16</sup> and the glorie of our Lord dwelt vpon Sinai, couering it with a cloud six dayes, and the seuenth day he called him out of the middes of the darkenesse. <sup>17</sup> And the forme of the glorie of our Lord, was as it were fire burning vpon the toppe of the mount, in the sight of the children of Israel. <sup>18</sup> And Moyses entring into the middes of the cloude, ascended into the mount: and he was there fourtie dayes, and fourtie nightes.
