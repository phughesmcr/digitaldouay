Israel must fight.

<sup>13</sup> Rise ye up therefore and pass the Torrent Zared, we came to it. <sup>14</sup> And the time, that we walked from Cadesbarne vnto the passage of the torrent Zared, was thirtie and eight yeares: vntil al the generation of the men that were warriers was consumed out of the campe, as our Lord had sworne: <sup>15</sup> whose hand was against them, that they should perish from among the campe. <sup>16</sup> And after al the warryers were dead, <sup>17</sup> our Lord spake to me, saying: <sup>18</sup> Thou shalt passe this day the borders of Moab, the citie named Ar: <sup>19</sup> and approching vnto the frontiers of the children of Ammon, beware thou fight not against them, neither once moue to battel: for I wil not geue thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I haue geuen it to the children of Lot in possession. <sup>20</sup> It was reputed the land of giantes: and giantes in old time dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites cal Zomzommim, <sup>21</sup> a great and huge people, and of long stature, as the Enacims whom our Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwel in their steede, <sup>22</sup> as he had done to the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, destroying the Horrheites, and deliuering their land to them, which they possesse vntil this present. <sup>23</sup> The Heueites also, that dwelt in Haserim as farre as Gaza, the Capadocians expelled: who issuing out of Capadocia, destroyed them, and dwelt in their steede. <sup>24</sup> Arise ye, and passe the torrent Arnon: behold I haue deliuered in thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrheite, and beginne to possesse his land, and <sup>25</sup> make warre against him. This day wil I beginne to send thy terrour and feare vpon the peoples, that dwel vnder the whole heauen: that hearing thy name they may quake, and tremble after the manner of wemen in trauel, and be pinched with sorow. <sup>26</sup> I sent therfore messengers from the wildernes of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable wordes, saying: <sup>27</sup> We wil passe through thy land, we wil goe the common high way: we wil not decline nei- <sup>28</sup> ther to the right hand, nor to the left. Sel vs meate for money, that we may eate: Geue vs water for money, and so we wil drinke. Onlie this that thou wilt graunt vs passage, <sup>29</sup> as the children of Esau haue done, that dwel in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: vntil we come to Iordan, and passe to the Land, which the Lord our God wil geue vs.
