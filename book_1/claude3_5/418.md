# THE ARGVMENT OF DEVTERONOMIE.

DEVTERONOMIE, in English The second law, *so called not that this booke is a repetition, explication, and supplement of the Law.*

<aside>This booke is a repetition, explication, and supplement of the Law.</aside>

[^1] there be two lawes of Moyses, but because the same which was first giuen in Mount Sinai, fiftie dayes after the children of Israel parted from Ã†gypt, is here repeted, in the eleuenth moneth of the fourtith yeare of their abode in the desert. In which repetition albeit Moyses explicateth the same law, adding also diuers things not expressed before: yet is it but an Abridgement conteined and vttered in fewer wordes. Wherevpon S. Bede (in princ. Leuit.) compareth this booke with the same precedent, as one made of them al. For whereas the former foure prefigured the foure Gos-pels, this signifieth the whole Gospel, conteined in the foure. Likewise S. Hierom calleth it A prefiguration of the Euangelical law: so iterating former things, that al become new of old. (*Epist ad Paulin. ca. 7. & de Mans. 42.*) But touching the literal sense, Moyses here committeth foure general things: vnto which after his death the fifth is added; and so the whole conteineth fiue partes. First, he briefly reciteth Gods special bene-fites bestowed on this people, and their ingratitude, incredulitie, murmu-rings, and punishments, in the three first chapters. Secondly he repeteth and explicateth Gods preceptes, moral, ceremonial, and iudicial, with the fun-ctions and offices of Priestes, and Leuites, from the 4. chap. to the 27. Thirdly he denounceth Gods promises of manie blessings, and threates of punishments, for keeping or breaking his commandments, from the 27. chap. to 31. Fourthly he exhorteth them to serue and loue God, but withal foretelleth, that they wil often fal to great sinnes, and for the same shal be punished, and at last for-saking Christ, shal be forsaken: yet finally blesseth their tribes, in figure of the Gentiles, that shal be called in their place. chap. 31. 32. and 33. Fiftly, in the last chapter, Iosue writeth the death, burial, and singular commendation of Moyses:
