Only internal repentance was necessarie, which was euer principally required (& therfore Ioseph deals so seuerely with his brethren, til they had hartie sorow and contrition for their sinnes) but also certaine external purifications, as washing and changing garments, were ordained. (Gen. 35.) Mariage though not then a Sacrament, yet was religiously regarded, with special care of faith and religion in the choise of persons, (Gen. 24.27. v. 46.c.28. v. 1.) and of certaine degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie. Adulterie was punishable by death (Gen.38.) and in no wise counted lawful, no not among the heathen. (Gen. 12. 20. 24. 26. 29. 34. 39.) Pluralitie of wiues in some persons and cases, lawful in the law of nature (Gen.16. 25. 29.) as also afterwards in the law of Moyses, not in the law of grace, nor euer pluralitie of husbands.

Spiritual blessing, a preeminence of greater persons, so Melchisedech blessed Abraham (Gen. 14.) Isaac blessed Iacob (c. 27.) and Iacob his sonnes (c. 49.) and the sonnes of Ioseph, with imposition of handes, and framing the forme of a crosse (48.) Other Ceremonies of oyle and wine (Gen. 28. 35.) sprinkling the bloud of the Paschal lambe, eating the lambe standing with their loynes gyrded, shooes on their feete, staues in their handes, and with speede (Exo. 12). Musical instruments in Diuine seruice. (Exod. 15.)

Christes Baptisme prefigured by Circumcision, (Gen. 17.) for Christians are circumcised (saith S. Paul) in the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him in Baptisme. Also by the cloude which stoode betwene the Ægyptians and Israelites, lightning the night on the one side (towards Gods people) dark on the other (towards their enemies) and by the redde sea, which saued the children of Israel, and drowned the Ægyptians (Exo. 14.) Al were baptised in the cloude, and in the sea. So the bread and wine offered by Melchisedech, the Paschal lambe, and vnleauened bread prefigured the B. Sacrament, and Sacrifice of Christes bodie and bloud, in formes of bread and wine. Iacob also prophecied of this most excellent Mysterie (Gen. 49.) He shal wash his stole in wine, and his cloke in the bloud of the grape. In like sorte Melchisedecks Priesthood was a plaine figure of Christes Priesthood, who first by himself consecrated and offered his owne bodie and bloud, and stil doth the same by his Priests handes of the new Testament.

Diuers other Rites were knowen and obserued by Tradition. As Abraham payed Tythes to his spiritual Superior (Gen. 14.) taught his children & familie to keepe the way of our Lord, and doe iudgement and iustice, (Gen. 18. v. 19.) Isaac and Iacob kept and taught the Ordinances, Preceptes and Ceremonies of their ancesters, without Lawes or preceptes written (Gen. 26.) Iudas commanded his second sonne to take the widow of his brother deceased without children (Gen. 38.) The children of Israel abstained from eating the sinew of the thigh, in remembrance that the sinew of Iacobs thigh was shrunke (Gen. 32.).
