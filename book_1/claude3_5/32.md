<sup>12</sup> Genesis. Adam.

Concupiscence in vs *wise it can be sinne, if it be not voluntarie, wherefore it was no sinne in Eve to no sinne, but be tempted by the serpent, which she could not auoide, nor in Adam to be tem- the effect, and pted by Eve, but they sinned when they consented to the evil suggestions. And occasion of now in the regenerate, though concupiscence remaine, which is the effect of sinne. sinne past, & occasion of sinne in those that yeld againe to tentations, yet is it not Also occasion sinne, but punishment of sinne, and matter of exercise in the iust, and if we of merite. resist, of merite: and therfore S. Paul exhorteth vs, *to walke in the spirit, and the lust of the flesh vve shal not accomplish*. And in an other place sheweth, *that vvhich fighteth lavvfully, shal be crovvned*.

<sup>13</sup> *She shal bruise*] Protestants wil not admitte this reading, ipsa conteret, she shal bruise, lest our Blessed Ladie should be said anie way to bruise the serpents head. And therfore among st others faith, that al ancient Fathers read, ipsum, not, ipsa. But he is conuinced of lying by Claudius Marius Victor. *lib. 1. in Gen*. Alcimus Auitus *lib. 3. carm. v. 6*. S. Chrisostom *hom. 17. in Genes*. S. Ambrose *lib de fuga seculi cap. 7*. S. Augustin *lib. 2. de Genes. contra Manichæos, cap. 18 & lib.11. de Genes. ad literam cap. 36*. S. Gregorie *lib. 1. Moralium cap. 38*. And after them S. Bede, Eucherius, Rabanus, Rupertus, Strabus, and Lira vpon this place, S. Bernard *ser. 2. super Missus est*. And manie others, who read, ipsa, as the Latin text now hath.

But whether we read, *she shal bruise*, or, *her sede*, that is her sonne Christ, *shal bruise the serpents head*, we attribute no more, nor no lesse to Christ, nor to our Ladie by the one reading, then by the other: for by the text, *I vvil put enmities betvven thee and the vvoman, betvven thy sede, and her sede*. It is clere, that this enmitie and battle perteined to the woman and her sede on the one partie, and to this diuel, that spake by the serpent, and al the wicked, on the other partie, and that the victorie should happen to mankind. Which being captiue by Adams sinne, occasioned by a woman, should be redemed, both the cause, and sexes, though in farre different sorte, concurring therto. And so it is most true, that Christ by his owne proper powre, and his blessed mother by her most immediate cooperating to his Incarnation (and consequently to other mysteries) did bruise the serpents head, breake and vanquish his powre. *As manie ancient Fathers do excellently discourse: namely S. Bernard, writing vpon these wordes in the Apocalips. cap. 12. A great signe appeared in heauen, a vvoman clothed vvith the sunne*. Albeit (saith he) by one man and one woman we were greatly damaged: yet (God be thanked) by one man and one woman al losses are repaired, and that not without great increase of graces. For the benefite doth farre excede the losse. Our merciful father geuing vs for a terrestrial Adam Christ our Redemer, & for old Eve Gods owne mother. Moreouer as the same S. Bernard sheweth, this blessed Virgin singular foe bruised the serpents head, in that she quite vanquished al manner suggestions of the wicked serper, neuer yelding to, nor taking delight in anie euil moued by him.

<sup>15</sup> *Dorelian art*] By these wordes Adam was admonished to humble him selfe, considering the matter wherof his bodie was made, and into which he should be resolued againe, wherupon it came to be a ceremonie amongst peni- tents, to cast ashes on their heades. As appeareth in holie Scriptures. for which cause the Church now also vseth this ceremonie the first day of Lent, putting ashes on her childrens heades: willing them to remember, that dust they are, and to dust they shal returne, to moue vs by this meditation to more serious penance.
