# Exodus

<sup>23</sup> heaven I have spoken to you. You shal not make goddes <sup>24</sup> of silver, nor goddes of gold shal you make to you. An Altar of earth you shal make to me, and you shal offer vpon it your holocaustes and pacifiques, your sheepe and oxen in everie place where the memorie of my name shal be: I wil come to thee, and wil blesse thee. <sup>25</sup> And if thou make an Altar of stone vnto me, thou shalt not build it of hewed stones: for if thou lift vp thy knife over it, it shal be polluted. <sup>26</sup> Thou shalt not goe vp by griefes vnto myne Altar, lest thy turpitude be discovered.

# ANNOTATIONS.
## CHAP. XX.

[^1] Protestants pretend here to prove, that al Catholiques are Idolaters, for honoring Sainctes, and their Reliques and Images. And they have so defamed Catholique Religion in this behalfe, that the vulgar sorte of deceived people, otherwise knowing Catholiques to be ordinarily of moderate conversation in life, of iust dealing towardes their neighboures, addicted to prayer, fasting, almes, and manie good workes, more wanting among them selves: yet supposing them, notwithstanding these laudable qualities, to be Idolaters, are therby averted from Catholique Religion. And surely it were a iost cause, if it were true. As wel therfore to purge our selves of so haynous an imputed crime, as to remove this dangerous block of erronious conceipte, we shal here note some of the Protestants egregious lies, against the whole Church militant, and blasphemous reproches against the the glorious Sainctes: then briefly declare the true and sincere doctrine, and practise of the Catholike Church in this point. Luther in his postil vpon the Gospel of our Lordes Incarnation, sayth: *Papista Virginem Mariam Deam fecerunt*: The Papists (saith he) make the Virgin Marie God: they attribute to her omnipotence in heaven and in earth. In Papistrie al expected more favour and grace from her, then from Christ himself. His scholar Melancton (*in locis communib*.) postiiling the first Precept, saith: Papistes invocate Sainctes, and worship Images in heathnish maner. Calvin (*li. de necess. refor Eccles.*) saith: those of the Emperours religion (meaning al Catholiques) so divide Gods offices among Sainctes, that they ioyne them to the Soveraigne God, as collegues; in which multitude God lieth hidden. Against the most glorious virgin mother the same Luther (*ser. de natali virg. Mar.*) feared not to say, that he estemed no more of the prayer of S. Marie, then of anie one of the people. And his reason is worse then his wicked assertion, for that, saith he, al that beleve in Christ are as iust, and as holie as the virgin Marie, or anie other Sainct how great soever. The Magdeburgian Centuriators (*li 1. Cent. 1.*) affirme that the virgin Marie sinned grevously, yea compare her imagined faultes with the sinne of Eve in paradise. (*li. 2.*) They charge S. Peter and S. Paul (also after their conversions) with divers great crimes. Calvin (*li. 3. Inst. c 2. parag. 31.*) condemneth Sara
