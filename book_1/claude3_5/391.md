## CHAP. XXIII.

Balaam endeuoureth to curse Israel, but God forceth him to blesse them. 11. Againe he vrgeth him to curse them, but he stil prophesieth good thinges of them. 26. Yet Balac insisteth willing him to curse, or not to blesse them.

<sup>1</sup> AND Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seuen altares, and prepare as manie calues, and rammes of the same number. <sup>2</sup> And when he had done according to the word of Balaam, they together laid a calfe and a ramme vpon an altar. <sup>3</sup> And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while beside thy holocauste, vntil I goe, if happely the Lord wil meete me, and whatsoeuer he shal command, I wil speake to thee. <sup>4</sup> And when he was gone in hast, God mette him. And Balaam speaking to him, said: I haue erected seuen altares, and haue laid thereon a calfe and a ramme. <sup>5</sup> And our Lord put a word in his mouth, and said: Returne to Balac, and thus shalt thou speake. <sup>6</sup> Returning he found Balac standing beside his holocauste, and al the princes of the Moabites: <sup>7</sup> and taking vp his parable, he said: From Aram hath Balac King of the Moabites brought me, from the mountaines of the East: Come, quoth he, and curse Iacob: make hast, and detest Israel. <sup>8</sup> How shal I curse, whom God hath not cursed? By what meanes may I detest, whom the Lord detesteth not? <sup>9</sup> From the highest flintes shal I see him, and from the hilles shal I view him. The people shal dwel alone, and among the Gentiles shal not be accounted. <sup>10</sup> Who may be able to number the dust of Iacob, and to know the number of the stocke of Israel? My soule die the death of the iust, and my last endes be made like to them. <sup>11</sup> And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou doest? That thou shouldest curse mine enemies I called thee: and thou contrariewise blessest them. <sup>12</sup> To whom he answered: Can I speake ought els, but that which the Lord commandeth? <sup>13</sup> Balac therfore said: Come with me into an other place whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see the whole, from thence curse them. <sup>14</sup> And when he had brought him into a high place, vpon the toppe of the mountaine Phasga, Balaam builded seuen altares, & laying theron calues and rammes, <sup>15</sup> he said to Balac: Stand here beside thy holocaust, whiles I goe to meete him. <sup>16</sup> Whom when our Lord had mette, and had put the word in his mouth, he said:

<aside>:: Before the diuel would curse Gods people he required sacrifices which being offered yet he could not execute his malice. For by Gods commandmáº½ts (saith S. Hierom. in mans. 42.) Israel is blessed, cursing turned into praise and Gods voice is heard sounding from a prophets mouth.</aside>

<aside>::Heretikes, & other infidels desire someti mes to die in state of Catholiques, though they wil not liue as they do. S. Greg. li. 31. c. 17. Moral.</aside>
