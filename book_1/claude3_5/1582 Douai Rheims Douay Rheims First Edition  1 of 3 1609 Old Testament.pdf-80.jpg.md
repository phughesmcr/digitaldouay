<sup>6</sup> Abram beleued God, and it was reputed to him vnto iustice. <sup>7</sup> And he said to him: I am the Lord that brought thee out from Vr of the Chaldees for to giue thee this land, and that thou mightest possesse it. <sup>8</sup> But he said : Lord God, how may I know that I shal possesse it ? <sup>9</sup> And our Lord answered, and said : Take me a cowe of three yeares old, and a shee goat of three yeares, and a ramme of three yeares, a turtle also, and a pigeon. <sup>10</sup> Who taking al these, diuided them by the mydes, and laid ech two peeces arowe one against the other: but the birdes he diuided not. <sup>11</sup> And the foules lighted vpon the carcasses, and Abram droue them away. <sup>12</sup> And when the sunne was setting, a deepe sleepe fel vpon Abram, and a great and darkesome horrour inuaded him. <sup>13</sup> And it was said vnto him : Know and foreknow that a pilgrime shal thy seede be in a land not their owne (and they shal bring them vnder bondage, and afflict them) :: foure hundred yeares. <sup>14</sup> But the nation, whom they shal serue, I wil iudge : and after this they shal goe forth with great substance. <sup>15</sup> And thou shalt goe to thy fathers in peace, buried in a good old age. <sup>16</sup> But in the fourth generation they shal returne hither : for :: as yet the iniquities of the Amorrheanes are not at the ful vntil this present time. <sup>17</sup> Therefore when the sunne was set, there rose a darke mist, and there appeared a fornace smoking, and a flake of fire passing betweene those diuisions. <sup>18</sup> That day God made a couenant with Abram, saying: To thy seede wil I geue this land from the riuer of Ã†gypt euen to the great riuer Euphrates, <sup>19</sup> the Cineans, & Cenezites, the Cedmonites, <sup>20</sup> and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaims also, <sup>21</sup> and the Amorreans & the Cananites, and the Gergasites, and the Iebusites.
