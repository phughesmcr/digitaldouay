<sup>25</sup> And he wil be merciful to vs, if we keepe and doe al his preceptes before the Lord our God, as he commanded vs.

## Chap. VII.

*No league nor felowship to be had with the Gentiles: 5. but their altares, groues, and al their idoles to be destroyed. 17. God promiseth victories to his people, willing them to trust in him, and serue him.*

<sup>1</sup> When the Lord thy God shal haue brought thee into the land, which thou doest enter in to possesse, and shal haue destroyed manie Nations before thee, the Hetheite, and the Gergezeite, and the Amorrheite, and the Chananeite, and the Pherezeite, and the Heueite, and the Iebuseite, seuen nations of much greater number then thou art, and stronger then thou: <sup>2</sup> and the Lord thy God shal haue deliuered them to thee, thou shalt strike them vnto vtter destruction. Thou shalt not make league with them, nor pitie them, <sup>3</sup> nor make mariages with them. Thy daughter thou shalt not geue to his sonne, nor take his daughter for thy sonne: <sup>4</sup> for he wil seduce thy sonne, that he folow not me, and that he rather serue strange goddes, and the furie of our Lord wil be wrath, and shal quickly destroy thee. <sup>5</sup> But these thinges rather you shal doe to them: Ouerthrow their altares, and breake their statues, and cutte downe their groues, and burne their sculptiles. <sup>6</sup> Because thou art a holie people to the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of al peoples, that are vpon the earth. <sup>7</sup> Not because you passed al nations in number, is our Lord ioyned vnto you, and hath chosen you, wheras you are fewer then al peoples: <sup>8</sup> but because our Lord hath loued you, and hath kept the oath, which he sware to your fathers: and hath brought you forth in a strong hand, and redemed you from the house of seruitude, out of the hand of Pharao the King of Ã†gypt. <sup>9</sup> And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keping his couenant and mercie to them that loue him, and to them that keepe his preceptes, vnto a thousand generations: <sup>10</sup> and rendering forthwith to them that hate him, so that he destroyeth them, and differreth no longer, immediatly repaieing to them that they deserue. <sup>11</sup> Keepe therfore the preceptes and ceremonies and iudgements, which I command

<aside>Not withstanding this com-mination, God oftentimes differreth pu-nishment, ex-pecting the sinners repen-tance.</aside>
