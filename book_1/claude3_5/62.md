Genesis

Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. <sup>23</sup> The children of Aram: 
Vs, and Hul, and Gether, and Mes. <sup>24</sup> And Arphaxad also 
begat Sale, of whom was borne Heber. <sup>25</sup> And to Heber 
were borne two sonnes: the name of the one was Pha-
leg, because that in his dayes was the earth diuided: and 
his brothers name was Iectan. <sup>26</sup> The which Iectan begat 
Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Iare, <sup>27</sup> and Aduram, 
and Vzal, and Decla, <sup>28</sup> and Ebal, and Abimael, Saba, 
<sup>29</sup> and Ophir, and Heuila, and Iobab. al these were the chil-
dren of Iectan. <sup>30</sup> And their dwelling was from Mesa as we 
goe on as far as Sephar a mountaine in the east. <sup>31</sup> These are 
the children of Sem according to their kinred and tongues, 
and countries in their nations. <sup>32</sup> These are the families of 
Noe, according to their peoples & nations. Of these were 
the nations diuided on the earth after the floud.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. X.

[^1] To this Nemrod the sonne of Chus, first builder and king of 
Babylon, Iosephus, S. Epiphanius, S. Hierom, S. Augustin, and generally al 
ancient writers ascribe the first tyrannie, and first setting vp of an earthlie citie 
opposite to the Citie of God after the floud. He was a *violent*, or rather a *vio-
lent hunter* a giant hunter (saith S. Augustin, according to the seuetie interpre-
ters) who by fallhood and force brought manie vnder his dominion. For he 
sturted vp pride, (saith Iosephus) and contempt of God in men, auoching that 
they were not beholding to God for present felicitie, but to their owne ver-
tue; and so supposing men would fal from God to him, if he offered him selfe 
a leader, and helper against a new floud, by little and little drew al to tyrannie. 
He was otherwise called Saturnus, and was at length amongst others ac-
counted a god. After him his sonne Belus Iupiter (as most authors affirme) 
raigned 65. yeares. And then succeeded Ninus the first king of the Assirians.

[^2] Here is great difficultie, and much dispute a-
mongst writers, who this Assur is. Briefly, we may either say with Iosephus, 
and S. Augustin, that Assur the sonne of Sem built a citie, which afterwards 
Ninus of Chams race enlarged, enriched, and changing the name called it 
Niniue: or els that this word *Assur* here signifieth (as. 4. Reg. 15. Psal. 82. Esaie 
10. & 31.) the king of Assirians, to wit Ninus the sonne of Belus, who as al histo-
ries greeke and barbarous reporte (saith S. Hierom) was the first that raigned 
ouer al Asia, & among the Assirians built Niniue a citie of his owne name, 
which the Hebrewes cal Niniue. He set vp the Monarchie of the Assirians, 
called the golden kingdom, which stood 1240. yeares. And made his father 
Belus to be honored for a god. To whom the Babylonians, as Plinie testifieth, 
first erected statues, altares, & temples. Of this Belus or Bel of Babylon were 
also deriued other false goddes, as Belial the god of Libertines, or without 
yoke, Beelphegor god of the Moabites, Beelzebub of the Accaronites, Baal in 
Samaria, Baalim amongst the Philistims: and the like in other nations.
