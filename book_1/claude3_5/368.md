<sup>3</sup>spoken by Moyses onlie? hath he not spoken to vs also in like manner? Which when our Lord had heard, (

<aside>The Holie Ghost forced Moyses to vter his owne praise, which of himself, he desired not.</aside>

<sup>4</sup>For Moyses was the mildest man aboue al men, that dwelt vpon the earth.) immediatly he spake to him, and to Aaron and Marie: Goe forth you three onlie to the tabernacle of couenant. And when they were come forth, <sup>5</sup>our Lord descended in the piller of a cloude, and stoode in the entrie of the tabernacle calling Aaron and Marie. Who going vnto him, <sup>6</sup>he said to them: Heare my wordes: If there shal be among you a prophete of the Lord, in vision wil I appeare to him, or in sleepe I wil speake to him. <sup>7</sup>But my seruant Moyses is not such an one, who in al my house is most faythful: <sup>8</sup>for mouth to mouth I speake to him: and plainely, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why therfore did you not feare to detract from my seruant Moyses? <sup>9</sup>And being wrath against them, he went away: <sup>10</sup>the cloude also departed that was ouer the tabernacle: and behold Marie appeared white with leprosie as it were snow. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her wholy couered with leprosie, <sup>11</sup>he said to Moyses: I beseech thee my Lord, lay not vpon vs this sinne which we haue foolishly committed, <sup>12</sup>let not this woman be as it were dead, and as an abortiue that is cast forth of the mothers wombe. Lo now the one halfe of her flesh is deuoured with the leprosie. <sup>13</sup>And Moyses cried to our Lord, saying: God, I beseech thee, heale her. <sup>14</sup>To whom our Lord answered: If her father had spitte vpon her face, ought she not to haue bene ashamed seuen daies at the least? Let her be separated seuen daies without the campe, and afterwards she shal be called againe. <sup>15</sup>Marie therfore was shut forth without the campe seuen daies: and the people moued not from that place, vntil Marie was called againe.

<aside>Aaron was not publikly punished, lest therby he had bene made contemptible to the people, but was otherwise chastised.</aside>

CHAP. XIII.

*From the desert of Pharan Moyses sendeth twelue men (of euerie tribe one) to view the Land of Chanaan. 17. changeth Osee his name into Iosue, 18. instructeth them which way to goe, and what to note: in the land: 21. which they performe: 26. and after fourtie dayes returne, bringing with them fruites, in token of the landes fertilitie, 29. but in other respects (the rest besides Caleb and Iosue) discouraging the people make them to murmur.*
