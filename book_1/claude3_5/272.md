Who being earnest about the worke, the people daily in the morning did offer their vowes. <sup>4</sup> Whereupon :: the artificers being constrained to come, <sup>5</sup> said to Moyses: The people offereth more then is necessarie. <sup>6</sup> Moyses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the criers voice: Let neither man nor woman offer anie more in the worke of the Sanctuarie. And so they ceased from offering giftes, <sup>7</sup> because the thinges that were offered did suffice and were ouer much. <sup>8</sup> And al the wise harted men, to accomplish the worke of the tabernacle, made ten curtines of twisted silke, and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twise died, with varied worke, and the arte of embrodering: <sup>9</sup> of which one had in length twentie eight cubites, and in bredth foure: there was one measure of al the curtines. <sup>10</sup> And he ioyned fiue curtines, one to an other, and the other fiue he coupled to themselues one with an other. <sup>11</sup> He made also loupes of hyacinth in the edge of one curtine on either side, and in the edge of the other curtine in like maner, <sup>12</sup> that the loupes might meete one against an other, and might be ioyned ech with other. <sup>13</sup> Whereupon also he did cast fiftie ringes of gold, that might catch the loupes of the curtines, and might be made one tabernacle. <sup>14</sup> He made also eleuen curtines of goates haire to couer the roofe of the tabernacle: <sup>15</sup> one curtine in length had thirtie cubites, & in bredth foure cubites: al the curtines were of one measure: <sup>16</sup> of which fiue he ioyned apart, & the other six apart. <sup>17</sup> And he made fiftie loupes in the edge of one curtine, and fiftie in the edge of an other curtine, that they might be ioyned one to an other. <sup>18</sup> And fiftie buckles of brasse wherwith the roofe might be knitte together, that of al the curtines there might be made one couering. <sup>19</sup> He made also a couer for the tabernacle of rammes skinnes died redde: & an other couer ouer that of ianthin skinnes. <sup>20</sup> He made also
