name, and called him in the Egyptian togue "the Sauiour of the world. And he gaue him to wife Aseneth the daughter of Putiphar" priest of Heliopolis. Ioseph therefore went forth <sup>46</sup> to the land of Ægypt( and he was thirtie yeares old when he stood in the sight of king Pharao) and did circuite al <sup>47</sup> the countries of Ægypt. And the fertilitie of the seuen yeares came: and the corne being bound vp into sheaues <sup>48</sup> was gethered togeather into the barnes of Ægypt. Al the abundance also of graine was laid vp in euerie citie. <sup>49</sup> And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it became equal to the sand of the sea, and the plentie exceeded <sup>50</sup> measure. And there were borne vnto Ioseph two sonnes before the famine came: whom Aseneth the daughter of <sup>51</sup> Putiphar priest of Heliopolis bare him. And he called the name of the first begotten • Manasses, saing: God made me <sup>52</sup> to forget al my labours, & my fathers house. The name also of the second he called • Ephraim, saing: God hath made <sup>53</sup> me to encrease in the land of my pouertie. Therfore when the seuen yeares of the plentifulnes, that had bene in Ægypt <sup>54</sup> were passed: the seuen yeares of scarsitie beganne to come, which Ioseph foretold: and in the whole world the famine preuailed, but in al the land of Ægypt there was <sup>55</sup> bread. The which being in hunger, the people cried to Pharao, desiring foode. To whom he answered: Goe ye to Ioseph: and whatsoeuer he shal say to you, that doe ye. <sup>56</sup> And the famine dayly encreased in al the land: and Ioseph opened al the barnes, and sold to the Ægyptians: for them <sup>57</sup> also the famine had oppressed. And al prouinces came into Ægypt, to buy victuales, and to moderate the miserie of the scarsitie.

CHAP. XLI.

[^1] *Made gouernour*] It is easie in the eyes of God, suddenly to enrich the Holie Ioseph poore. For who would haue thought (saith Philo) that in one day a boudman suddenly ad-should be made a lord, a poore prisoner the chiefe of the nobilitie, an vnder uanced, gaoler the viceroy, or kings deputie, for a common prison to haue a kinglie court of his owne, from extreme ignominie, to ascend into so high a roome of dignitie!

[^2] *Sauiour of the world*] In the original text the new name and title geuen

<aside>Cohen signifi-eth priest, as not only the latin, but also the 70. & Philo and Iosephus here translate though some-times it signi-fieth Prince. as the Chaldey paraphrasis interpreteth, whereby it is probable that this Putiphar was both a priest, and a prince.</aside>
