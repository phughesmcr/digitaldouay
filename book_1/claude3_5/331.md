And behold there went forth the sonne of a woman of Israel, whom she had borne of an Egyptian among the children of Israel, and fel at wordes in the campe with a man of Israel. <sup>11</sup> And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to Moyses: (And his mother was called Salumith, the daughter of Dabri of the tribe of Dan.) <sup>12</sup> And they did cast him into prison, til they might know what our Lord would command. <sup>13</sup> Who spake to Moyses, <sup>14</sup> saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the campe, and let al that heard him, put their handes vpon his head, and let al the people stone him. <sup>15</sup> And to the children of Israel thou shalt speake: The man that curseth his God, shal beare his sinne: <sup>16</sup> and he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him dye: al the multitude of the people shal stone him, whether he be a natural, or stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him dye. <sup>17</sup> He that striketh, and killeth a man, dying let him dye. <sup>18</sup> He that striketh a beast, shal render one for it, that is to say, soule for soule. <sup>19</sup> He that giueth anie of his neighbours a blemish: as he did, so shal it be done to him: <sup>20</sup> fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth he shal restore. What blemish he gaue, the like shal he be compelled to sustaine. <sup>21</sup> He that striketh a beast, shal render an other. He that striketh a man, shal be punished. <sup>22</sup> Let there be equal iudgement among you, whether a stranger, or a natural sinne: because I am the Lord your God. <sup>23</sup> And Moyses spake to the children of Israel: and they brought him forth that had blasphemed, without the campe, and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as our Lord had commanded Moyses.
