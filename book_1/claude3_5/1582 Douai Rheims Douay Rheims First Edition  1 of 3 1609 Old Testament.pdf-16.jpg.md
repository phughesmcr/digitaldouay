# PROEMIAL ANNOTATIONS.

Numeri, & Deuteronomie; whereto answer in the new Testament, the foure Gospels of S. Matthew, S. Marke, S. Luke, & S. Iohn.

[^1] Historical bookes of the old Testament, are the bookes of Iosue, Iudges, Ruth, foure bookes of Kinges, two of Paralipomenon, Esdras with Nehemias, Tobias, Iudith, Hester, Iob, & two of the Machabees; vnto which, in the new Testament, answer the Actes of the Apostles.

[^2] Sapiential, of the old Testament, are the Prouerbes, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Booke of wisdome, & Ecclesiasticus; and of like sorte are in the new Testament, the Epistles of S. Paul & of other Apostles.

[^3] Prophetical bookes are Daniel, Psalter (which is also Sapiential, yea likewise Legal and Historical) the Bookes of Isaias, Ieremias with Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, the twelue lesse Prophetes, Osea, Ioel, Amos, Abdias, Ionas, Michaeas, Nahum, Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zacharias, Malachias. And in the new Testament, the Apocalips of S. Iohn the Apostle.

[^4] Al these Bookes are vndoubtedly Canonical, as the Authors cited in the inner margent testifie. And consequently al, and al the partes therof, are of infallible truth. For otherwise as S. Augustin teacheth, if anie part were false, or doubtful, al were vncertaine. Once admitting falsehood (saith he, psal. 30. 44. tom. 8.) in such soveraigne authoritie, no parcel of these bookes should remaine, which anie way should seme hard to maners, or incredible to beleue, but it might by this most pernicious rule be turned to an officious fiction of the author. That is: if anie error could be committed by the authores of Scriptures, either through ignorance, obliuion, or anie other humane fraultie, what soever were produced, exception might be taken, and question made, whether the author had erred, or no? True it is, that some of these bookes (as we shal particularly discusse in their places) were sometimes doubted of by some Catholiques, and called Apocryphal, in that sense, as the word properly signifieth hidden, or not apparent, so S. Ierom (in his Prologue before the Latin Bible) calleth diuers bookes Apochryphal, being not so euident, whether they were Diuine scripture, because they were not in the Iewes Canon, nor at first in the Churches Canon, but were neuer reiected, as false or erroneous. In which sorte the Prayer of Manasses, the third booke of Esdras, and third of Machabees are yet called Apocryphal. As for the fourth of Esdras, and fourth of Machabees there is more doubt. But diuers others, as the booke ascribed to Enoch, the Gospels of S. Andrew, S. Thomas, S. Bartholomew, and the like reiected by S. Gelasius (Decreto de libris Eccle. distinct. 15. Can. Sancta Romana) S. Innocentius the first (Epist. 3.) S. Ierom, ep. ad Laetam, S. Augustin li. 15. cap. 23. de ciuit. Dei. Origen homil. 1. in Cantica, are in worse sense called Apocryphal, & are reiected as con-

[^1]: Historical.

[^4]: Al these bookes recited are Canonical, and of infallible truth.
