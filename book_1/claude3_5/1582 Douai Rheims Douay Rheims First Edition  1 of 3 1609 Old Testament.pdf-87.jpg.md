GENESIS.

he ranne to meete them from the dore of his tent, and adored
to the ground. <sup>3</sup> And He said: Lord, if I haue found grace
in thy sight, goe not past thy seruant: <sup>4</sup> but I wil fetch
a litle water, and wash ye your feete, and rest ye vnder the
tree. <sup>5</sup> And I wil set a morsel of bread, and strengthen
your hart, afterward you shal passe: for therefore are you
come aside to your seruant. Who said: Do as thou hast spoken.
<sup>6</sup> Abraham made hast into the tent to Sara, and said to her:
Make hast, temper together three measures of floure, and
make harth cakes. <sup>7</sup> But him selfe ranne to the heard, and
tooke from thence a calfe verie tender and verie good, and
<sup>8</sup> gaue it to a young man: who made hast and boiled it. <sup>9</sup> He
tooke also butter and mylke, and the calfe which he had
boyled, and set before them: but him selfe did stand beside
them vnder the tree. <sup>9</sup> And when they had eaten, they
said to him: Where is Sara thy wife? He answered: Loe she is
<sup>10</sup> in the tent. To whom he said: Returning I wil come to
thee at this time, life accompanying, and Sara thy wife shal
haue a sonne. Which when Sara heard, she laughed behind
<sup>11</sup> the dore of the tent. <sup>12</sup> And they were both aged, and farre
entred in yeares, and it ceased to be with Sara after the
maner of wemen. <sup>13</sup> Who laughed secretly saying: After
I am waxen old, & my Lord is an old one, shal I geue my selfe
<sup>14</sup> to pleasure? <sup>15</sup> And our Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sara
laugh, saying: Shal I an old woman beare a child in deed?
<sup>16</sup> Is there any thing hard to God? According to appointment
I wil returne to thee this verie selfe same time, life accompanying, and Sara shal haue a sonne. <sup>17</sup> Sara denied, saying:
I laughed not: being much afraid. But our Lord: It is not
<sup>18</sup> so, saith he: but thou didst laugh. <sup>19</sup> When the men therefore
were risen vp from thence, they turned their eyes against
Sodome: and Abraham did goe with them, bringing them
<sup>20</sup> on the way. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord said: Can I conceale from Abraham the things which I wil doe: <sup>22</sup> wheras he shal be
into a nation great, and verie strong, and in him are
TO BE BLESSED al the nations of the earth? <sup>23</sup> For I
know that he wil commande his children, and his house
after him that they kepe the way of the Lord, and doe iudgement and iustice: that for Abrahams sake the Lord may
bring to effect al the things that he hath spoken vnto him.
<sup>24</sup> Therfore said our Lord. <sup>25</sup> The crye of Sodome, and
Gomorre
