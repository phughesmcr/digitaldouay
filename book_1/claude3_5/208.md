Some things in the Paschal Lambe prefigured Christ both on the Crosse and at his last supper.

Some more expressly signified his Passion.

Others immediately the Eucharist.

scence of the one with the other make it more clere, that as in some respectes it more resembled Christes Passion, and Sacrifice on the Crosse, so in others it more expressed the Eucharist, and mystical commemoration of his death, though also in manie it prefigured Christ in both places. For example, The preparing of the lambe the *tenth day*, signified our Saviours coming into Hierusalem, the same tenth day of the first moone, now represented in the Church on Palme sunday. Also the choise qualities of the lambe, *without spotte, a male, of the first yeare*, foreshewed in general the puritie, fortitude, meekenes, and al perfection of the true *Lambe of God, that taketh away the sinnes of the world*. <sup>Ioan. 1.</sup> More particularly *the killing* and betewing the Paschal Lambe of natural life, *the sprinkling of his bloud on the dore-postes, the eating at at euen*, and *not breaking anie bone therof*, most specially expressed Christes death on the Crosse. But *the fourteenth day*, as *the common voice* only with the Eucharist, instituted the night before our Lords Passion, which he suffered the fifteenth (being the ful moone) and at midday, as ancient S. Dionyse of Ariopagite (in two Epistles, to Policarpus, and to Apollophanes) testifieth; admiring the miracle of the sunnes Eclipse, that hapned the same time. Neither did the *eating of the Lambe* directly prefigurate the oblation on the Crosse, for Christ was not crucified to be eaten but the Sacrament *in forme of bread and wine* was expressly figured by eating the lambe with *vnleuened bread*, and drinking *the cuppe thereto adioyned*. <sup>Luc. 22.</sup> In like sorte the Lambe immolated *in commemoration* of the deliuerie of Israel from death, and from seruitude, when the first-borne of Ã†gypt were slaine, most aptly prefigured the Eucharist, which is a perpetual commemoration of mans redemption, and deliuerie from eternal death, and from bondage of the diuel and sinne, by Christes death on the Crosse, which death in deede was the very redemption and deliuerie of mankind, and not a commemoration therof. Finally the immolation of the Lambe *within the house* with precise commandment to *eate nothing therof forth*, pertained particularly to the Eucharist, which our Lord celebrated *within the house*, wherby S. Cyprian (*lib. de vnit. Eccles.*) proueth, that the B. Sacrament must not be giuen to anie out of the *Catholique Church*, though Christes Passion be extended to al the world, as wel to bring such as are without, into the Church, as to saue those that are already entre in. In this sorte the most ancient and best expositors of holie Scripture, explicate this special figure of the Paschal Lambe: As we shal here produce some witnesses in confirmation of this truth.

Tertullian *lib. 4. contra Marcionem*, expounding our Saviours wordes: *With desire I haue desired to eate this Pasch with you before I suffer* (saith), Christ coueted not *recreatum Pascha*, the mutton of the Iewes, but professing that with desire he desired to eate the Pasch, as his owne (for it was vnmete that God should couete anie thing not his owne) the bread which he tooke, and gaue to his disciples, he made his owne bodie, saying: *This is, that is, a figure of my bodie*. *A figura autem non fuisset, nisi veritatis esset corpus*. But it had not bene a figure (saith he) *vnles it were a bodies veritie*, or, *a veritie lie*, to wit, not phantastical as the heretike Marcion imagined; because the figures in the old Testament were not figures, except a true bodie answered vnto them. So the Sacrament after Tertullian should cal the Eucharist a figure, against his meaning, and maketh him conclude nothing against Marcion; whereas his whole drift is, by the figures of the old Testament to proue, that in the Eucharist is the true & real bodie of Christ, and that consequently Christ hath a true and real bodie Origen (*in 26. Mat.*) teacheth that in the great parlar (where Christ did eate the Paschal Lambe) he also made his new Pasch.
