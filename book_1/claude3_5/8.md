# To the English Reader.

ing in wordes, some also in sense, as in long processe of time, the writers erred in their copies; now lately by the care & diligence of the Church, those diuers readings were maturely, and iuditiously examined, and conferred with sundrie the best written and printed bookes, & so resolued vpon, that al which before were leift in the margent, are either restored into the text, or els omitted; so that now none such remaine in the margent. For which cause, we haue againe conferred this English translation, and conformed it to the most perfect Latin Edition. Whereby the way we must geue the vulgar reader to vnderstand, that very few or none of the former varieties, touched Controuersies of this time. So that this Recognition is no way suspicious of partialitie, but is merely donne for the more secure conseruation of the true text; and more ease, and satisfaction of such, as otherwise should haue remained more doubtful.

Augustin also yeldeth a reason, exemplifying in the wordes *Amen* and *Alleluia*, *for the more sacred authoritie therof*: which doubtles is the cause why some *names of solemne Feastes, Sacrifices*, & other holie thinges are *reserued in sacred tongues*, Hebrew, Greke, or Latin. Againe for necessitie, English not hauing a name, or sufficient terme, we either kepe
