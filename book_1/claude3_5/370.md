<sup>26</sup>And the discouerers of the Land returning after fourtie daies, hauing circuted al the countrie, <sup>27</sup>came to Moyses & Aaron and to al the assemblie of the children of Israel into the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades. And speaking to them & to al the multitude they shewed the fruites of the Land: <sup>28</sup>and reported, saying: We came into the Land to which thou didst send vs, which in very deede floweth with milke and honie, as by these fruites may be knowen: <sup>29</sup>but it hath very strong inhabitantes, and cities great and walled. The stocke of Enac we saw there. <sup>30</sup>Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hetheite and the Iebuseite and the Amorrheite in the mountaines: but the Chananeite abideth beside the sea and about the streames of Iordan. <sup>31</sup>Among these thinges Caleb appeasing the murmuring of the people that rose against Moyses, said: Let vs goe vp and possesse the Land, because we may obtaine it. <sup>32</sup>But the others, that had bene with him, said: No, we are not able to goe vp to this people, because it is stronger then we. <sup>33</sup>And they detracted from the Land, which they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying: The Land, which we haue viewed, deuoureth her inhabitantes: the people, that we beheld, is of a tall stature. <sup>34</sup>There we saw certaine monsters of the sonnes of Enac, of the gyantes kind: to whom being compared, we seemed as it were locustes.

CHAP. XIII.

*The mutinous murmuring people being vnplacable, 11. God expostulateth their ingratitude, threateneth to destroy them. 13. Yet Moyses pacifieth his wrath, 22. but so that al which were numbered coming from Ægypt, except Caleb and Iosue, shal die in the wildernes: 31. and their children shal possesse the promised land. 40. Then fighting contrarie to Moyses admonition are beaten, and manie slaine by their enimies.*

<sup>1</sup>THERFORE al the multitude crying out wept that night, <sup>2</sup>and al the children of Israel murmured against Moyses and Aaron, saying: <sup>3</sup>Would God we had died in Ægypt: and in this vaste wildernesse would God we might die, and that our Lord would not bring vs into this Land, lest we fal by the sword, and our wiues and children be ledde captiue. Is it not better to returne into Ægypt? <sup>4</sup>And one said to an other: Let vs appoint a captaine, and let vs returne into Ægypt. <sup>5</sup>Which Moyses and Aaron hearing fel

[^1]: Pretending falsly that the Land had an vnwholsome ayre, deuouring the inhabitates, & not possible to be obtained by reason of the gyantes: couertly they detracted fro Gods power, or his good wil towards them, who had promised the same. And therfore he gaue it to their children, but not to these seducers and murmurers. *chap. 14. v. 13, 29.*
