Abram.

hard to his former conceipte, that for the same he receiued singular prayse; and for the like afterwards was called *The father of manie nations* (c. 17. v. 5) and by S. Paul, *The father of al that beleue* (Ro. 4. v. 11) where the Apostle teacheth that Abraham had no iustice, nor estimation of iustice before God, vntil he beleued in Christ (v. 18. 19. 20) because al workes before true faith are insufficient. Neyther was this a sole faith but had other necessarie vertues of hope, and charitie, humilitie, reuerence, obedience, & the like ioyned with it. wherfore S. Iames testifieth that Abraham was iustified by workes (that is by workes folowing faith not going before faith. For *faith without workes, is dead in it self* (c. 2. v. 17) *And by workes faith was consummat.* v. 22. And concludeth thus: Do yee see, that by workes a man is iustified and not by faith only. v. 24.

[^1]: Not workes before faith but ioyned with faith are meritorious.

[^2]: Onlie faith doth not iustifie.

Our Lord iudge between me and thee. <sup>6</sup> To whom Abram making answere: Behold, saith he, thy handmaid is in thine owne hand, vse her as it pleaseth thee. When Sarai therefore did afflict her, she ranne away. <sup>7</sup> And an angel of our Lord hauing found her, beside a fountaine of water in the wildernesse, which is in the way to Sur in the desert, <sup>8</sup> he said to her: Agar, the handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? who answered: From the face of Sarai my mistresse doe I flye. <sup>9</sup> And the angel of our Lord said to her: Returne to thy
