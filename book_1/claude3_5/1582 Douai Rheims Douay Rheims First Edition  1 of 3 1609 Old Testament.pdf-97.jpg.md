Hebron, in the land of Chanaan : And Abraham came to
mourne, and weepe for her. <sup>3</sup>And after that he was risen
vp from[^1] the funeral obsequies, he spake to the children
of Heth, saying: <sup>4</sup>I am a stranger and pilgrime among
you : geue me the right of a sepulchre with you, that I
may burie my dead. <sup>5</sup>The children of Heth answered,
<sup>6</sup>saying: † My lord heare vs, thou art a prince of God among vs: in our principal sepulchres burie thou thy dead:
and no man can let thee but that in his owne monument
thou mayest burie thy dead. <sup>7</sup>Abraham rose vp, and adored the people of the land, to wit the children of Heth:
<sup>8</sup>and he said to them: If it please your soule that I burie
my dead, heare me, and be intercessors for me to Ephron
<sup>9</sup>the sonne of Seor: † that he geue me the duble caue,
which he hath in the vttermost part of his field: for money
to the worth therof let him deliuer it to me before you
<sup>10</sup>for possession of a sepulchre. † And Ephron dwelt in the
middest of the children of Heth. And Ephron made answer
to Abraham in the hearing of al that went in at the gate
<sup>11</sup>of the citie, saying: † No, it shal not be so, my lord, but
thou rather harken to that which I doe say: The field I
deliuer to thee, and the caue that is therin, in the presence
<sup>12</sup>of the children of my people, burie thy dead. † Abraham adored before the people of the land. † <sup>13</sup>And he
spoke to Ephron, his people standing round about: I beseech
thee to heare me: I wil geue money for the field: take it,
<sup>14</sup>and so I wil burie my dead in it. † And Ephron answered:
<sup>15</sup>† My lord, heare me. The ground which thou desirest, is
worth foure hundred sicles of siluer: this is the price
betwene me and thee: but how much is this? burie thy dead.
<sup>16</sup>Which when Abraham had heard, he weyed the money,
that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of
Heth, foure hundred sicles of siluer of common currant
<sup>17</sup>money. † And the field that before time was Ephrons,
wherin was the duble caue, looking towards Mambre,
aswell it, as the caue, and al the trees therof in al the limits
<sup>18</sup>therof round about: † was made sure to Abraham for a
possession, in the sight of the children of Heth, and of al
<sup>19</sup>that went in at the gate of his citie. † And so Abraham buried
Sara his wife in the duble caue of the field, that looked
towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the land of Chanaan.
