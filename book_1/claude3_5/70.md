so houres, setteth forth their owne, & silenceth them only in place of goddes. Thus
farres. Athanasius. Name we like countries, prouinces, cities, and townes
in these partes of Europe, where Luthers scholars haue set their seete,
consider the forme of Religion, and opinions which they hold, and we shal
see as vnorderlie beginnings, and as horrible dissentions in heresies (which
S. Hierom calleth the Idols of the New Testament) as the ancient fathers haue in c. 11.

ration, but proceding of bastards race, vpstartes of vnknowne progenie, are
no lesse at discordes among them selues, only al agreing against Catholi-
ques, like syncretisantes against their comon enimies, or Herod, Pilate, &
the Iewes against Christ. And in England alone are diuers sectes without
possible meanes to agree in one. For albeit the ciuil state endeuoreth prudently
and seriously to bring al to vniformitie, at least in publique shew, yet they
are but like manie faces vnder one hood, euerie sorte keping their owne opini-
ons: yea almost euerie preacher and meane scholar (to say nothing of artificers
and common ministers) arrogating to be his owne iudge, contemneth to
stand to Luther or Caluin, to Geneua or Parlament, to Conuocation or Synod
of their owne, but to his owne only vnderstanding, and interpretation of
holie Scripture. Nor yet to that alwayes; for when he is pressed with that he
once said, he wil forgete it, or eate his owne word, if he haue not written it, or
that you haue readie witnes against him; so hard it is to make a deceiued Pro-
testant or Puritan confesse that he is conuinced, except by very pregnant mea-
nes you can first cast out of him, or bind fast the spirite of presumption, dissen-
tion and contention: wheras the simpliest Catholique in the world hath the
selfe same faith in al points, with the whole Church, in which he remaineth,
and vpon whose iudgement he dependeth.

To returne therfore, from whence we are not vnnecessarily digressed, we
conclude with S. Augustin; When Moyses had shewed the beginning and ib. 16. c.
progresse of Nemrods earthlie citie, leauing it in Babylon, that is confu- 10. ciuit.
sion, as needles to prosecute it futher, he returneth to declare the perinal
succession of the Citie of God, the Church, as before the floud from Adam
to Noe, by the line of Seth, so after the floud from the same Noe, by the line
of Sem, Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, Phaleg, Reu, Sarug, Nachor,
Thare, and Abraham. The rest of Sems children, and al the progenies of
Iapheth and Cham, as not pertaining to this purpose, omitted, so connecting
those in order of generations, by whom the succession is directly brought to
Abraham, Prince of the elected people, a most special Patriarch, to whom new
and great promises are made of multiplication of his seede, and possession
of the land of Chanaan, but especially of Christ our Redemer, and the same
manie waies confirmed, as wil appeare in the next age.
