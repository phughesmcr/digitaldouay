## CHAP. VII.

*Moyses being constituted as God of Pharao, and Aaron as the prophet of Moyses, they declare Gods commandment to Pharao; 10. turne the rodde into a serpent; 17. & the water into bloud, which is the first plague. 22. The magicians doe the like by inchantments, and Pharaos hart is indurate.*

<sup>1</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Behold I haue appointed thee " the God of Pharao : and Aaron thy brother shal be " thy prophet. <sup>2</sup> Thou shalt speake to him al thinges that I command thee: and he shal speake to Pharao, that he dismisse the children of Israel out of his land. <sup>3</sup> But " I wil indurate his hart, and wil multiplie my signes and wonders in the Land of Ægypt, <sup>4</sup> and he wil not heare you: and I wil put in my hand vpon Ægypt, and wil bring forth my armie and people the children of Israel out of the Land of Ægypt by very great iudgements. <sup>5</sup> And the Ægyptians shal know that I am the Lord, which haue stretched forth my hand vpon Ægypt, and haue brought forth the children of Israel out of the middes of them. <sup>6</sup> Therfore Moyses and Aaron did as our Lord had commanded: so did they. <sup>7</sup> And Moyses was eightie yeares old, and Aaron eightie three, when they spake to Pharao. <sup>8</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses and Aaron: <sup>9</sup> When Pharao shal say vnto you, Shew signes: thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rodde, and cast it before Pharao, and it shal be turned into a serpent. <sup>10</sup> Therfore Moyses and Aaron going in vnto Pharao, did as our Lord had commanded. And Aaron tooke the rodde before Pharao and his seruantes, the which was turned into a serpent. <sup>11</sup> And Pharao called the wise men and the enchanters: and they also by Ægyptian enchantments and certaine secretes did in like maner. <sup>12</sup> And euery one did cast forth their roddes, the which were turned into dragons: but Aarons rodde deuoured their roddes. <sup>13</sup> And Pharaos hart was indurate, and he heard them not, as our Lord had commanded. <sup>14</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Pharaoes hart is aggrauated, he wil not dismisse the people. <sup>15</sup> Goe to him in the morning, behold he wil goe forth to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meete him vpon the banke of the riuer: and the rodde that was turned
