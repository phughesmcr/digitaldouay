tabernacles, and said: Our Lord hateth vs, and therfore hath
brought vs out of the Land of Ægypt, that he might deliuer
vs into the hand of the Amorrheite, and destroy vs. <sup>28</sup> Whither
shal we goe vp? the messengers haue scared our hart, saying:
The multitude is verie great, and taller of stature then we:
the cities greate, and fensed euen vnto heauen, the sonnes of
the Enacims we haue seene there. <sup>29</sup> And I said to you:
<sup>30</sup> Feare not, neither be ye afrayd of them: Our Lord God,
which is your conductour, him self wil fight for you, as he
<sup>31</sup> did in Ægypt in the sight of al. <sup>32</sup> And in the wildernesse
(thy selfe haste seene) the Lord thy God hath caried thee,
as a man is wont to beare his litle sonne, al the way, that you
haue walked, vntil you came to this place. <sup>33</sup> And neither
so did you beleue the Lord your God, <sup>34</sup> who went before
you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you
should pitch your tentes, in the night shewing you the way
by fyre, and in the day by the piller of a clowde. <sup>35</sup> And
when our Lord had heard the voice of your wordes, being
wrath he sware and said: <sup>36</sup> There shal not any of the men of
this wicked generation see the good Land, which by oath I
promised to your fathers: <sup>37</sup> beside Caleb the sonne of Ie-
phone. For he shal see it, and to him I wil geue the Land,
that he hath troden, and to his children, because he hath fo-
lowed the Lord. <sup>38</sup> Neither is his indignation against the
people to be merueiled at, wheras our Lord being angrie
with me also for you, said: Neither shalt thou enter in thither.
<sup>39</sup> But Iosue the sonne of Nun thy minister, he shal enter for
thee: exhort and strengthen him, and he shal by lotte diuide
the Land to Israel. <sup>40</sup> Your litle ones, of whom you said that
they should be ledde captiues, and your sonnes that this day
know not the difference of good and euil, they shal enter in:
and to them I wil geue the Land, and they shal possesse it.
<sup>41</sup> But returne you and goe into the wildernesse by the way
of the Reddesea. <sup>42</sup> And you answered me: We haue sinned
to our Lord: we wil goe vp and fight, as the Lord our God
hath commanded. And when you readie armed went vnto
the mountaine, <sup>43</sup> our Lord said to me: Say to them: Goe
not vp, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you fal be-
fore your enemies. <sup>44</sup> I spake, and you heard not: but resi-
sting the commandement of our Lord, and swelling with
pride you went vp into the mountaine. <sup>45</sup> Therfore the
