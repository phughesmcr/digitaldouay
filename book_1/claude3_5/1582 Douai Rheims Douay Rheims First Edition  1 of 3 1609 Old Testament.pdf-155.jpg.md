said to them: Be it done according to your sentence: with whom soever it shal be found, be he my bondman, and you shal be guiltles. <sup>11</sup> Therefore in haste taking downe their sackes vpon the ground, euerie man opened. <sup>12</sup> Which when he had searched, beginning from the elder euen to the youngest, he found the cup in Beniamins sack. <sup>13</sup> But they renting their garments, and loading their asses againe, returned into the towne. <sup>14</sup> And Iudas formost with his brethren entred in to Ioseph (for he was not yet gone out of the place) and they fel togeather before him on the ground. <sup>15</sup> To whom he said: Why would you doe soe? know you not that there is not the like to me in the science <sup>16</sup> of diuining. To whom Iudas said: What shal we answer, my lord? or what shal we speake, or be able iustly to pretend? God hath found the iniquitie of thy seruantes: loe we are al bondmen to my lord, both we, & he, with whom <sup>17</sup> the cup was found. Ioseph answered: God forbid that I should so doe: he that stole the cup, the same be my bondman: and goe you free vnto your father. <sup>18</sup> And Iudas approaching nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee my lord, let thy seruant speake a word in thine eares, and be not angrie <sup>19</sup> with thy seruant: for after Pharao thou art, my lord. Thou didest aske thy seruantes the first time: Haue you a father or <sup>20</sup> a brother? and we answered thee my lord: We haue a father an old man, and a litle boy, that was borne in his old age: whose brother by the mother is dead: and his mother <sup>21</sup> hath him only, and his father loueth him tenderly. And thou saidst to thy seruants: Bring him hither to me, and I wil <sup>22</sup> set myn eyes on him. We suggested to my lord: The boy <sup>23</sup> can not leaue his father: for if he leaue him, he wil die. And thou saidest to thy seruants: Vnlesse your youngest brother <sup>24</sup> come with you, you shal no more see my face. Therefore when we were gone vp to thy seruant our father, we told <sup>25</sup> him al things that my lord did speake. And our father said: <sup>26</sup> Goe againe, and buy vs a litle wheate. To whom we said: We can not goe: if our youngest brother shal goe downe with vs, we wil set forward together: otherwise he being absent, <sup>27</sup> we dare not see the mans face. Whereunto he answered: <sup>28</sup> You know that my wife bare me two. One went forth, and you said: A beast did deuour him: and hitherto he appeareth not.
