<sup>13</sup>the promise, concerning the frogges, which he had agreed to Pharao. And our Lord did according to the word of Moyses: and the frogges dyed out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fieldes: <sup>14</sup>and they gathered them together into huge heapes, and the earth did rotte. <sup>15</sup>And Pharao seing that rest was geuen he hardned his owne hart, and heard them not, as our Lord had commanded. <sup>16</sup>And our Lord said to Moyses: Speake to Aaron: Stretch forth thy rodde, and strike the dust of the earth: and be there Sciniphes in the whole Lord of Ægypt. <sup>17</sup>And they did so. And Aaron streched forth his hand, holding the rodde: and he stroke the dust of the earth, and there were made sciniphes on men and on beastes: al the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphes through the whole Land of Ægypt. <sup>18</sup>And the enchaunters with their enchauntmentes practised in like maner, to bring forth sciniphes, and they could not: and there were sciniphes aswell on men as on beastes. <sup>19</sup>And the enchaunters said to Pharao: This is the finger of God. And Pharaoes hart was indurate, and he heard them not as our Lord had commanded. <sup>20</sup>Our Lord also said to Moyses: Arise early, and stand before Pharao: for he wil goe forth to the waters: and thou shalt say to him: This saith our Lord: Dismisse my people to sacrifice vnto me. <sup>21</sup>And if thou wilt not dismisse them, behold I wil send in vpon thee, and vpon thy seruantes, and vpon thy people, and vpon thy houses al kind of flies: and the houses of Ægypt shal be filled with flies of diuers kindes, and the whole land wherin they shal be. <sup>22</sup>And I wil make the Land of Gessen meruelous in that day, wherin my people is, so that flies shal not be there: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the middes of the earth. <sup>23</sup>And I wil puta diuision betwene my people & thy people: to morow shal this signe be. <sup>24</sup>And Our Lord did so. And there came a very greuious flie into the houses of Pharao and of his seruantes, and into al the Land of Ægypt: and the Land was corrupted by such kind of flies. <sup>25</sup>And Pharao called Moyses and Aaron, and said to them. Goe and sacrifice to your God in this land. <sup>26</sup>And Moyses said: It can not so be done: for if we shal offer the abominations of the Ægyptians to the Lord our God: and if we kil those thinges which the Ægyptians doe worshippe before them: they wil beate vs downe with stones. <sup>27</sup>We wil goe forth three dayes iourney
