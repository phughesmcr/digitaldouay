ping his finger, he touched the hotnes of the altar, and pou-
red the rest at the foote therof. <sup>10</sup> And the fatte, and the litle
kidneis, and the caule of the liuer, which are for sinne, he
burnt vpon the altar, as our Lord had commanded Moyses:
<sup>11</sup> but the flesh and skinne therof he burnt with fire without
the campe. <sup>12</sup> He immolated also the victime of holocaust: and
his sonnes brought him the bloud therof, which he poured
in the circuite of the altar. <sup>13</sup> The hoste also it selfe being cut
into peeces, they brought with the head and euerie member.
<sup>14</sup> Al which he burnt with fire vpon the altar, <sup>15</sup> hauing first
washed the entralles and the feete with water. <sup>16</sup> And offe-
ring for the sinne of the people, he slew the bucke goat: and
expiating the altar: <sup>17</sup> he made the holocaust, <sup>18</sup> adding in
the sacrifice the libaments, which are offered withal, and bur-
ning them vpon the altar, beside the ceremonies of the mor-
ning holocaust. <sup>19</sup> He immolated also the oxe, and the
ramme, the pacifique hostes of the people: and his sonnes
brought him the bloud, which he poured vpon the altar
round about. <sup>20</sup> The fatte also of the oxe, and the rump of
the ramme, and the two little kidneis with their fattes, and
the caule of the liuer <sup>21</sup> they put vpon the brests. and after
the fatte was burnt vpon the altar, <sup>22</sup> their brests, and the
right shoulders, Aaron did seperate, eleuating them before
our Lord, as Moyses had commanded. <sup>23</sup> And stretching
forth his hand to the people, he blessed them. And so the
hostes for sinne, and the holocaustes, and the pacifiques being
finished, he descended. <sup>24</sup> And Moyses and Aaron going
into the tabernacle of testimonie, and afterward comming
forth, blessed the people. And the glorie of our Lord appeared
to al the multitude: <sup>25</sup> and behold a fire comming forth from
our Lord, deuoured the holocaust, and the fatte that was v-
pon the altar: Which thing, when the multitude had seene,
they praised our Lord, falling on their faces.

CHAP. X.

Nadab and Abiu the sonnes of Aaron, for offering strange fire, are burnt
to death, and cast out of the campe. 6. for whom the people mourne, but
not the Priests. 8. Priests are forbid to drinke wine, when they enter into
the tabernacle, 12. and are commanded to eat the residew of oblations in
the holie place. 16. which this time in part they omitted, and are excused,
being sorowful for that which happened to Nadab and Abiu.
