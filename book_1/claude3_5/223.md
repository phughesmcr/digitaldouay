# Exodvs.

hel is my house, and in darknes I haue made my bed. *Which place or receptacle of such Saintes, as Iacob and Iob, was doubtles farre distant from hel of the damned, for betwene Lazarus in Abrahams bosome and the glutton in tormentes, is a great chaos (or large space) and yet the highest of these places is called hel.*

In respect of Resurrection, the same Iacob called his life in this world a pilgrimage (Gen. 47.) and Iob, (ch. 7.) a warfare vpon earth: professing expressly (ch. 19.) In the last day I shal rise out of the earth. And I shal be compassed againe with my skinne, and in my flesh I shal see God. *Our B. Sauiour also proueth the Resurrection, because the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob (Exo. 3.) is God of them, not as they are dead, but as they are liuing, and to returne againe to life in bodie and soule together. Of general Iudgement Iob saith (ch. 31.) What shal I doe when God shal rise to iudge? and when he shal aske, what shal I answere him? And Elius (ch. 34.) saith: The omnipotent wil render a man his worke, and according to the waies of euerie one, he wil recompence them. Sodom and Gomorra (Gen. 19.) were example (saith S. Peter: and S. Iude) of eternal punishment in hel fire. Of eternal life Iacob professed his hope (Gen. 49.) saying: I wil expect thy saluation ô Lord. And Moyses (as S. Paul testifieth) denied him selfe to be the sonne of Pharaoes daughter, esteeming the reproch of Christ greater riches, then the treasure of the Ægyptians. For he looked vnto the reward. Thus much touching particular pointes of Religion. It resteth to see the visible knowen members of the Church, with the heades and gouernors therof, succeding without interruption in the same age, notwithstanding some brake and departed from them, and other innumerable sectes of Infidels stil multiplied in the world.*

To beginne therfore with Abraham, before the former age was ended, (at which time he was 75. yeares old,) holie Scriptures stil speake of him, as alwaies vndefiled, and a true seruant of God, though his father Thare and his brother Nachor sometimes serued strange goddes, (Iosue. 24.) but were reclaimed, and the whole familie, (as S. Augustin proueth, lib. 16. c. 13. de ciuit) was preserued by the Chaldees. Wherupon There leauing Chaldea brought Abraham, Lot, and Sarai, so farre as Haran in Mesopotamia (Gen. 11.) whither also Nachor repaired afterwards, and there made his habitation, as appeareth (Gen. 24.) But Abraham was sooner, and more specially persecuted in Chaldea, as Iosephus testifieth (li. 1. Antiq.) for his clere and publique profession of one God, Creator of al thinges, and that by his only goodnes, and not by mens owne power, happines is attained. Further Suidas (vocab. Abraham) writeth, that at the age of 14. yeares, he admonished his father, not for lucre sake, to seduce men by worshipping images of false
