To the moe you shal geue the larger, and to the fewer the straiter. To euerie one as the lotte shal fall, so shal the inheritance be geuen. By the tribes and the families the possession shal be diuided. <sup>55</sup> But if you wil not kil the inhabitantes of the Land: they that remaine, shal be vnto you as it were nailes in your eyes, and speares in your sides, and they shal be your aduersaries in the Land of your habitation: <sup>56</sup> and whatsoeuer I had thought to do to them, I wil do to you.
