<aside>Priests prouision of God.</aside>

<aside>Protestantes friuolous eua­sion.</aside>

Deuteronomie.

Where the high priest by vertue and priuilege of his office, vttered the truth, which him selfe neither meant nor vnderstood. And this happened when the Law and Priesthood of the Iewes was to decline & geue place to Christs new ordinance; and therfore no doubt God euer directed the sentence of the high Priest: and most specially now Christ preserueth the Apostolique See from error in faith, and in general decrees touching manners: yea though the chiefe visible Iudge were as wicked as Caiphas. And therfore the Protestantes euasion is friuolous, limiting the priests sentence to binde the subiectes, *so long as he is the true minister of God, and pronounceth according to his word*. For except God assisted him, that he should pronounce according to his word, and so al men rest satisfied, submitting them selues to his sentence, the controuersie should be endles, and this consistorie nothing worth: but stil be new examinations, and new iudgementes, whether the former were according to Gods word or no.

<aside>Pride in pri­uate opinion punished with death.</aside>

[^1] *Herby shal be proued*. This also conuinceth, that al were bound to accept of the high priests sentence, the law condemning him of pride, that refused to obey the commandment of the Priest, which was ministred to our Lord, and for his disobedience punishing him with death.

Chap. XVIII.

*In stead of other inheritance Priestes and Leuites haue prouision by Sacrifices and oblations. 9. Al superstition to be auoided. 15. Promisse of pro­phetes, and finally one special Prophet (to wit, Christ) is promised. 20. False prophetes must be slaine.*

<sup>1</sup>The priestes and Leuites, and al that are of the same tribe, shal haue no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel, because they shal eate the sacrifices of our Lord, and his oblations, <sup>2</sup>and nothing els shal they receiue of the possession of their brethren: for our Lord him selfe is their inheritance, as he hath spoken to them. <sup>3</sup>This shal be the right of the priestes from the people, and from them that offer victimes: whether they immolate oxe, or sheepe, they shal geue to the priest the shoulder and the mawe: <sup>4</sup>the first fruites of corne, of wine, and oile, and a part of the wolle of their sheepe shearing. <sup>5</sup>For him hath our Lord chosen of al thy tribes, that he might stand, and minister to our Lord he and his sonnes for euer. <sup>6</sup>If a Leuite goe out of one of thy cities of al Israel in the which he dwelleth, and would come desiring the place which our Lord shal choose, <sup>7</sup>he shal minister in the name of our Lord his God, as al his brethren the Leuites, that shal stand at that time before our Lord. <sup>8</sup>He shal receiue the same portion of meates, that the rest doe: beside that, which in his owne citie is dew to him by succession from his fathers. <sup>9</sup>When thou art entred the Land, which our Lord thy God shal geue thee, beware
