## A BRIEFE REMONSTRANCE OF THE STATE OF THE CHVRCH, AND FACE OF Religion, in the first age of the world. From the creation to Noes floud: the space of 1656. yeares.

HERE according to our purpose mentioned before, we wil briefly recite certaine principal points of Religion, taught and observed in the first age. In which the foundations of the true maner of serving God (that should be continued to the end of the World) were laid, and prospered in some, as appeareth in these seven first chapters of Genesis. But first of al, we shal in two words repete (as it is clerly gathered in the same holie scripture) the state of man before, and immediatly after his fall, being the subject to whom al this pertayneth.

After therfore that God had created other things, both in heaven and earth, last of al he made man, to his owne image and likenes, with vnderstanding and freewil, therin like to Angels, and superior to al other creatures, and so made him lord and master of al earthlie things.

Man obeyed His mind, wil, and reason were obedient to God; his senses or inferior parts of his soule were subject to reason; his flesh and bodie obeyed the spirit; and al earthlie creatures obeyed him. God also adorned man with excellent knowledge, both natural and supernatural. And his bodie was of incorruptible substance, so that the same, and al his posteritie, if they had not sinned, should haue benne conserued, and without dying, haue benne translated to euerlasting life. Thus man was placed in Paradise, and Eve there made of a ribbe of his side, to be his mate and vnseparable companion, as man and wife ioyned in Mariage by God himselfe: for increase and multiplication. As appeareth in the two first chapters of this booke.

But God hauing made man right, he intangled him selfe (as holie Scripture speaketh) with infinite questions. For the diuel enuying mans felicitie inuegled our mother Eve with questions and lies, and then by her, first seduced and deceiued, allured also Adam to the transgression of Gods commandment. And so they lost original iustice, which Adam had receiued for him selfe and al mankind: and al proceeding from them by natural propa-
