iection to his divine Maiestie. And that not only in internal affection, which (as S. Augustin, and al Catholique Doctors teach) is principally required, but also in external things, because we consist of bodie, and not only of soule, and haue, by Gods goodnes, the vse of corporal things. As here we see example in the law of nature: and the same was ordained by written precept in the law of Moyses: the Prophets also foretold, that external Sacrifice should be offered in the law of grace, and new Testament, to wit, the same which Christ instituted, and left in his Church, to continue to the end of the world. Moreouer this homage of offering Sacrifice is so peculiar to God only, that albeit manie other exterior rites and seruices are vsed both to God & men, as to prostrate, to bowe, to kneele, to kiss the earth before them, *with great humilitie and to creatures*[^1] (saith S. Augustin) *we of religious pietie, to such as are holie indeed, vene- rando, salutando, or multum adorando, or adorando; non to be worshipped, venerated and if much be geuen them, adored* (for this terme of adoring is also applied to men in holie Scripture Gen. 23. v. 7. 27. v. 29.) yet Sacrifice is due to God only, and to no creature how excellent so euer. In so much (saith the same Doctor) that as al nations found it necessarie to offer Sacrifice, to none durst sacrifice *to anie nisi ei, quem Deum aut sciuit, aut putauit, aut finxit:* but to him whom they either knew, or thought, or fained to be God.

<sup>4</sup> *Hadve'res to Abel* [Both Cain and Abel did wel in offering external Sacrifice, but they differed much in the ritie and maner of choosing or diuiding their oblations, touching Gods part and their owne, as S. Iustinus Martyr, S. Hierom, S. Augustin and others teach. For Abel offered of the best things, *of the first borne of his flock, and of their fatte*. And therefore God respected and approued it. But to Cain and to his giftes he had not respect, because he wan- ted sincere deuotion. Which difference of Gods acceptance appeared doubtles, as S. Hierom and S. Augustin suppose, by some external signe, otherwise Cain had not vnderstood it. Most likely it was by fire sent from God, which inflamed and consumed Abels Sacrifice, & not Cains. As we read of diuers other Sacri- fices in holie Scripture.

<sup>7</sup> *Shalt thou not receiue:* Reward of good workes, and punishment of euil are clerly proued by this place. God saying to Cain: *If thou doest wel, shalt thou not receiue?* that is, shal wel doing be without reward? as Abel receiued consolation of accepting his Sacrifice wel offered. *but if thou doest il, shal not sinne forthwith* out ward afflicting thy conscience, and not suffering thy mind to be in quiet, *for remorse of thy wicked fact, and feare of iust iudgement*. For hence it came that Cains countenance fel, and his stomack boyled with anger: punish- ment so beginning euen in this life, & much more in the next world our Saui- our wil render (as him selfe saith) to euery man according to his workes: which the Apostle expresseth more distinctly, *eternal life, or wrath & indignation*.

[^1]: *S. Paulina* (This Text so plainly sheweth freewil in man, also after his falle, that the English Protestants to auoid so clere a truth, for these wordes, *shalt thou not receiue?* (to wit of God) *if thou doest wel*, corruptly translate in some of their Bibles thus: *If thou doest wel, shalt thou not be accepted?* Another his desire shalbe subiect, and thou shalt rule ouer him. As if God had said, that Abel should be subiect to Cain. A false and heretical translation. S. Augustin controlleth maintayning the true construction of the wordes, *Si recte offeras, recte autem non diuidas, peccasti: quiesce*. *Thou hast sinned, rest*. Our vulgar Latin is, *Ouer what then but sinne?* In other English Editions, namely in the last, which we suppose they wil stand to, it is better but yet obscure thus, *Shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not wel, sinne lieth at the dore*.
