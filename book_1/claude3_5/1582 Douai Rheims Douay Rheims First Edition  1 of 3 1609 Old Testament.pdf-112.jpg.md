like places of Scripture. As when our Saviour said of S. Iehn Baptist (Math. 11.) *He is Elias* meaning that he was Elias in spirite not in person. So Iacob said truly that he was Esau, not meaning in person but in right of the first borne, by Gods ordinance: Esau also having condescended therto by covenant and oath. In that also he deceived his father, was no sinne. For it was a lawful and good deceipt, such a one (saith S. Chrisostom) as Hieremie speaketh *Ho. 6. of, Lord thou hast deceived me, and I am deceived*, so Isaac was deceived, not as we ad *Col. commonly cal deceipt, but to his owne and others good, by Gods disposition. For 2. 4.* as S. Kieryl thinketh Salomans demanding of S. Hierom, what might *Epist. be the reason why God would suffer his chief seruant Isaac not to know Iacob, 125.* but to be deceived, and through ignorance to blesse whom he would not, declareth that it happened not only to Iacob, but also to manie other holie men, to be ignorant of manie things, and to be deceived in error of opinion: and that this error was profitable to Isaac and his house. For if he had geuen this blessing (which was a spiritual Iurisdiction) to Esau, as he purposed, he had committed a notorious error in dede, by preferring a bloudie man, one that was readie, if he could, to haue killed his brother: (v. 41.) omitting him, that was sincere and very vertuous, and had done his owne wil, not Gods wil therin.

<aside>It was good that Isaac knew not Iacob when he blessed him.</aside>

But why would not God reuel his wil to Isaac (as he had commanded a farre greater thing to Abraham to sacrifice the same Isaac) that he might witingly haue blessed Iacob by Gods commandment? The Fathers do probably alleage this for one reason, that if Esau, being a fierce and cruel man, had perceiued that his father had wilingly preferred Iacob, he would haue bene incensed against his father, conceiued and attempted euil against him. An other reason S. Chrisostom and Theoderet do yeld, that by this strange maner of im- *Ho. 53. parting this blessing, it might more manifestly appeare to be Gods wil and 7. 75. in ordinance, and not to procede from mans affection, that Iacob should be Gen.* preferred.

CHAP. XXVIII.

*Iacob with his fathers blessing, and admonition not to take a wife of Chanaan, but of the daughters of his vncle Laban, goeth into Mesopotamia: (6. Esau in the meane time marieth a third wife, his vncle Ismaels daughter) 11. Iacob seeth in sleepe a ladder reaching to heauen, Angels ascending and descending, and our Lord leaning theron renewed the promise, so made to Abraham and Isaac. 16. And he awaking maketh a vow.*

ISAAC therfore called Iacob, and blessed him, and com- 1 manded him saying: Take not a wife of the stocke of Chanaan: <sup>2</sup> but goe, and make a iourney into Meso- 2 potamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel thy mothers father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thin vncle. <sup>3</sup> And God almightie blesse thee, and make thee 3 encrease
