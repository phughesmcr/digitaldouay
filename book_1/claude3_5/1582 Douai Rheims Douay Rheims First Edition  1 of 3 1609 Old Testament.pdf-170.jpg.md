GENESIS.

<aside>of revenge, was manie wayes faultie.</aside>

of truly did it vnknowne to their father they putting him & themselves in extreme danger, if God had not maruelously protected them; in falsly pretending agreement and league with the Sichemites, which they ment not to performe; and in sacrilegiously abusing the Sacrament of Circumcision, making it a cloke to deceive their ennemies. In the fact also they committed other foure grosse crimes: cruelly killing those, that offered other abundant satisfaction; murthering others that were altogether innocent; sacking and destroying the citie; and carying away women and children captiue. Mystically S. Ambrose, S. Ruffinus, Isidorus, and others vnderstand this pro-

<aside>The Priests & Scribes furie, obstinate, & hard against Christ.</aside>

phecie, of the Scribes and the Priests, decending of Simeon and Leui, who were most rage against our Sauiour: as himself more plainly foretold, saying: *The sonne of man shalbe betrayed to the cheife Priests, and they shal condemne him to death.* Their furie was cursed aboue al furie, *because* (as Iacob here saith) *it was stubborne*, or obstinate: for they did not only condemne Christ to death in their wicked counsel, but also vrged and pressed Pilat, endeuoring to saue him, & stirred vp the people to crye: *Take him away, Crucifie him*. Yea their *indignation was so hard*, that they preferred Barabbas before Christ.

<aside>Taking away of the regal scepter from the Iewes a signe of Christ coming.</aside>

<sup>10</sup> The scepter shal not be taken away. ] Here the Patriarch Iacob foretelleth the time, when the promised Messias should come into the world, by this signe that the scepter should not be taken from Iuda, til the same Redeemer of mankind were at hand. Not that the regal scepter should remaine in the Tribe of Iuda, from Iacobs death til Christes comming: for that Kingdome beganne first in Dauid, aboue six hundred yeares after Iacobs death, and after the captiuitie of Babylon the highe Priests of the Tribe of Leui did gouerne also the state, & not only the Church, other six hundred yeares. But the sense is, that of the Tribe of Iuda should rise most gloriouse Kinges, whose crowne and Kingdom should remaine with the Iewish Nation, vntil their expected Messias should draw nere, and then be taken from them by the Gentiles. Which was done by Herod, whose father was an Idumean, his mother an Arabique. Thus the Ancient fathers with one accorde vnderstood this prophecie. S. Iustinus Martyr. *res. cont. Tryph.* Eusebius Cesariensis. lib. Hist. Eccles. cap 6. S. Athanasius. *lib. de Incarnat.* S. Ambrose *lib. de Benedict. Patriarch* c. 4. S. Chrysostom. *Ho. 67. in Gen.* S. Augustin lib. 18. c. 45. *de ciuit.* Theodoretus. q. 110. in Gen.

<aside>Our Lords real presence in the B. Sacrament prophecied.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> *He shal wash his stole in wine.* ] By wine, and blood of the grape, what other thing is shewed (saith S. Cyprian Epist ad Caecil. 63) but the wine of our Lords blood? Likewise Tertullian (lib 4. contra Marcionem) expoundeth the stole to signifie Christes flesh, and the wine his blood. In al which booke his drift is to proue that Christ did not destroy the olde Testament, but fulfilled the figures and prophecies therof. And not that Christ gaue his bodie in figure only, as our aduersaries alledge him.

<aside>Ancient Fathers supposed that Antichrist shalbe of the tribe of Dan.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> *Be Dan a snake in the way.* ] This prophecie most ancient Fathers vnderstood of Antichrist, namely S. Irenaeus, *lib. 5. c. aduerf. haeres.* S. Hyppolitus Martyr *orat. de consummat. seculi.* S. Ambrose c. 7 *de Benedict. Patriarch.* S. Augustin. q. 22. *in Iosue.* Prosper, *lib. de promiss. & predict. Tem.* p. 4. Theodoret. q. 110. *in Gen.* S. Gregorie, *lib. 30. Moral. c. 18*, and many others vpon the 7. chap. of the Apocalips. where they suppose S. Iohn did omitte Dan from amongst the Elect of the Israelitical Tribes, in detestation of Antichrist, to be borne of that Tribe. And certayne it is, that the Iewes wil receiue, and folow him for their Messias, as our Sauiour himself saith: *Which maketh it very probable, that he shal be a Iewe borne, else they would not so easily admit him.*
