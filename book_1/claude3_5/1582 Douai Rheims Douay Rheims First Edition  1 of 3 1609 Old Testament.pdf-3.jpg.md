AT last through Gods goodnes (most dearly beloued) we send you here the greater part of the Old Testament: as long since you received the New; faithfully translated into English. The residue is in hand to be finished: and your desire therof shal not now (God prospering our intention) be long frustrate. As for the impediments, which hitherto haue hindered this worke, they al proceded (as manie do know) of one general cause, our poore estate in banishment.
