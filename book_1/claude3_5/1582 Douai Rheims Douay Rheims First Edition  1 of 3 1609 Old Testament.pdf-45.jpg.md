perverse generation, which declined unto evil, which would not so much as pretend anie resemblance of vertue : that generation therfore, in those times, that iust man not only pretended, but attained to that height of vertue, that he became perfect, and in al thinges absolute. And that which I said before, to doe wel amongst the enimies of vertue, amongst them that forbid vertue, doth alwaies testifie a greater poyse of vertue, to by this occasion the iust man got greater prayses. Neither doth diuine Scripture here make an end of praising him, but further (to expresse the excellencie of his vertue, and that he was approved by Gods owne censure, for besides saying: *He was perfect in his generation*, it addeth, that *Noe pleased God*. So great was the renowne of his vertue, that he deserued to be praised of God. For *Noe pleased God* saith the Scripture, that you may know that he was approued of God. He pleased that eye, that can not be deceiued, by the good worke. Thus farre S. Chrisostom : and much more to the same effect. S. Gregorie the great in his fifth booke of Morales, and 36. chapter vpon the third chapter of Iob, recounting certaine principal Patriarches among the rest saith: *Noe for that he pleased God; examina­tion was saued aliue in the vniuersal world*: and after a large catalogue of other iust men in confirmation of this doctrine, that some were iust in the law of nature concludeth thus: *Whence it is to be beleeued* (saith he) *that onlie manie were iust before the law was receiued, as Moyses contrasteth in his most briefe de­scription*.

15. *Three hundred cubites*] Apelles an old heretike, (scholar of Marcian,) but af­ter leauing him, and amongst other new coyned heresies, reiecting the Law & the Prophetes, would by this place impugne Moyses, saying it was impossible that into smale rowme, as was the arke by this description, the defined partes of al kindes of beastes, foules, & serpents, should be contained, with the eight persons, and al their prouision of meate for a whole yeare. Wherupon he concludeth that this narration (which he calleth a fable) hath no probabilitie, nor possibilitie to be true. To whom & al such calumniators it may be answe­red, that Moyses euen in an heretikes owne cōceipt, if malice obscured not his sense, must needes be thought wise enough, if he had benne disposed to fayne fables, to frame them probable, or possible, especially when he pretended not to signifie a miracle, in the smallnes of the rowme to receaue so much, as he re­porteth. Origen to answer him (supposeth a cubite here mentioned, to haue cō­tained six ordinarie cubites: and so doubtles the arke might easily containe al thinges that are here spoken of, for it were like to a great citie. But this opi­nion neither hath good warrant, that euer the Ægyptians (of whom he suppo­seth Moyses might haue learned it,) or any other nation vsed such long cubites, neither can this measure of a cubite, be agreable to Moyses meaning, who no doubt speaketh of the like cubites here, as he doth in other places. And in Exodus he describeth an altar to be made fiue cubites long, and broade, and three in height. Which would be by Origens measure (euerie cubite contay­ning six ordinarie cubites, that is nine foote at least) in length, and likewise in breadth 45. foote, and 27. foote in height. Againe (Deut. 3.) Moyses telleth of an iron bed of Og King of Basan, that was nine cubites long, & foure broad. Which make according to Origens measure of a cubite, fourescore and one foote in length, and in breadth 36. foote: which in deede haue no probabili­tie. And therfore S. Augustin and other Doctors, supposing that Moyses in al these bookes, written for instruction of the same people, whom he brought forth of Ægypt, speaketh of one sorte of cubites, do likewise iudge that he meaneth ordinarie & knowne cubites, which containe a foote & a halfe euerie cubite,

[^3]: Origens opi­nion of long cubites not probable.

[^4]: Moyses in o­ther places can not be vn­derstood to speake of o long cubites.
