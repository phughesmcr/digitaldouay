and Balaam

<sup>6</sup> face of the earth, sitting against me. Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier then I: if by any meanes I may strike them and cast them out of my land. for I know that he is blessed whom thou shalt blesse, and cursed vpon whom thou shalt heape curses. <sup>7</sup> And the ancientes of Moab went, and the elders of Madian, hauing the price of diuination in their handes. And when they were come <sup>8</sup> to Balaam, and had told him al the wordes of Balac: he answered: Tarie here this night, and I wil answer what-soeuer the Lord shal say to me. And whiles they stayed <sup>9</sup> with Balaam, God came, and said to him: What would <sup>10</sup> these men that are with thee? He answered: Balac the sonne of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me, <sup>11</sup> saying: Behold a people that is come out of Ægypt, hath couered the face of the land: come, and curse them, if by any meanes fighting I may driue them away. <sup>12</sup> And God said to Balaam: Goe not with them, neither doe thou curse the people: because it is blessed. <sup>13</sup> Who in the morning arising said to the princes: Goe into your countrie, because <sup>14</sup> the Lord hath forbid me to come with you. The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with vs. <sup>15</sup> Againe he sent many moe and more noble, then he had <sup>16</sup> sent before. Who when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus sayeth Balac the sonne of Sephor: Slacke not to come <sup>17</sup> to me: for I am readie to honour thee, and whatsoeuer thou wilt I wil geue thee: Come, and curse this people. <sup>18</sup> Balaam answered: If Balac would geue me his house ful of siluer and gold, I can not change the word of the Lord <sup>19</sup> my God, to speake either more, or lesse. I beseech you that you wil also tarie here this night, and I may know what <sup>20</sup> the Lord wil answer me once more. God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: If these men be come to cal thee, arise and goe with them: yet so, that thou <sup>21</sup> doe that which I shal command thee. Balaam arose in the <sup>22</sup> morning, and sadling his asse went with them. And God was angrie. And an Angel of our Lord stoode in the way against Balaam, who sate vpon the asse, and had two seruantes <sup>23</sup> with him. The asse seeing the Angel standing in the way, with a drawen sword, turned her self out of the way, and went by the field. Whom when Balaam had bette, and <sup>24</sup> had brought her againe to the beaten way, the Angel

[^3]: God our Lord answered him, not suffering the diuel to speake in this case.

[^4]: Being sufficiently informed before, for worldlie lucre he demandeth againe, & God for his punishment letteth him goe: but suffereth him not to curse, nor speake against his wil of the Israelites, but cõtrariwife to prophecie much good, which should come vnto them.
