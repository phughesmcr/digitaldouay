sticking fast by the hornes, which he tooke and offered an
holocaust in stede of his sonne. <sup>14</sup>And he called the name of
that place, Our Lord seeth. Wherupon even to this day it is
said, In the mountaine our Lord wil see. <sup>15</sup>And the angel of
our Lord called Abraham the second time from heaven,
saying: <sup>16</sup>By my owne selfe have I sworne, saith the Lord:
because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thine
onlie begotten sonne for my sake: <sup>17</sup>I wil blesse thee, and I
wil multiplie thy sede as the starres of heaven, and as the
sand that is by the sea shore: thy sede shal possesse the gates
of his enemies, <sup>18</sup>and in thy sede SHALL BE BLESSED al
the nations of the earth, because thou hast obeyed my voice.
<sup>19</sup>Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to
Bersabee together, and he dwelt there. <sup>20</sup>These things so
being done, it was told Abraham that Melca also had borne
children to Nachor his brother, <sup>21</sup>Hus the firstbegotten, &
Buz his brother, and Camuel the father of the Sirians, <sup>22</sup>and
Cased, and Azau. Pheldas also & Iedlaph, <sup>23</sup>and Bathuel, of
whom was borne Rebecca: these eight did Melcha beare
to Nachor Abrahams brother. <sup>24</sup>And his concubine, named
Roma, bare Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXII.

1. *Tempted.*] God tempteth none to evil (as S. Iames teacheth) but by
trial and experiment maketh men knowen to the world, as here Abrahams
faith and singular obedience were manifested, when he doubted not to offer his
*onlie begotten in sacrifice, accounting that God is able to raise vp men from the dead.*
Wherupon he received his sonne againe *in parable*, that is, in figure and mysterie of Christ dead and aliue againe. Isaac also in this action signified the divinitie of Christ which suffered not, and the ramme among the briers figured
his humanitie, that should be offered in Sacrifice to God.

[^1]: *Heb. 11, 19.*
[^2]: *Io. 16. c.*
[^3]: *1. Corin. Theod. q. 72 in Gen.*

Isaac figured Christs divinitie, the Rame his humanitie.
