the seuen ful eares: be seuen yeres of plentifulnes: and
both conteine the selfe same meaning of the dreame.
<sup>27</sup> Also the seuen leane and thinne kine, that came vp after
them, and the seuen thinne eares, and blasted with the
burning winde: are seuen yeares of famine to come. <sup>28</sup> Which
shal be fulfilled in this order. <sup>29</sup> Behold there shal come
seuen yeares of great fertilitie in the whole Land of Ægypt:
<sup>30</sup> after which shal folowe other seuen yeares of so great
sterilitie, that al the abundance before shal be forgotten:
for the famine shal consume al the land, <sup>31</sup> and the greatnes
of the scarsitie, shal destroy the greatnes of the plentie.
<sup>32</sup> And in that thou didest see the second time a dreame per-
teining to the same thing: it is a token of the certaintie, for
that the worde of God shal come to passe, and be fulfilled
spedely. <sup>33</sup> Now therfore let the king prouide a wise man and
industrious, and make him ruler ouer the Land of Ægypt:
<sup>34</sup> that he may appointe ouerseers ouer al countries: and
gether into barnes the fifth part of the fruites, during the
seuen yeares of the fertilitie, <sup>35</sup> that now presently shal
ensewe: and let al the corne be laid vp, vnder Pharaoes
handes, and let it be reserued in the cities. <sup>36</sup> And let it be
in a readines, against the famine of seuen yeares to come,
which shal oppresse Ægypt, and the land shal not be con-
sumed with scarsitie. <sup>37</sup> The counsel pleased Pharao, and al
his seruants: <sup>38</sup> and he spake to them: Can we find such an
other man, that is ful of the spirite of God? <sup>39</sup> He said ther-
fore to Ioseph: Because God hath shewed thee al things that
thou hast spoken, can I find a wiser and one like vnto thee?
<sup>40</sup> Thou shalt be ouer my house, and at the commandment
of thy mouth al the people shal obey: only in the throne
of the kingdome I wil goe before thee. <sup>41</sup> And againe Pha-
rao said to Ioseph: Behold, I haue appointed thee ouer the
whole land of Ægypt. <sup>42</sup> And he tooke his ring from his
owne hand, and gaue it into his hand: and he put vpon him
a silke roabe, and put a chaine of gold about his necke.
<sup>43</sup> And he made him goe vp into his second chariot, the cryer
proclayming that al should bowe their knee before him,
and that they should know he was made gouernour ouer
the whole Land of Ægypt. <sup>44</sup> And the king said to Ioseph:
I am Pharao: without thy commandment no man shal moue
hand or foote in al the land of Ægypt. <sup>45</sup> And he turned his
