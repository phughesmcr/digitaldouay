<sup>27</sup> our Lord shal choose: and thou shalt offer thy oblations the flesh and the bloud vpon the altar of the Lord thy God: the bloud of thy hostes thou shalt power on the altar: and the flesh thyself shalt eate. <sup>28</sup> Obserue and heare al thinges that I command thee, that it may be wel with thee and thy children after thee for euer, when thou shalt doe that which is <sup>29</sup> good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God. When the Lord thy God shal haue destroyed before thy face the nations, that thou entrest in to possesse, and thou shalt possesse them, and dwel in their land: <sup>30</sup> beware lest thou imitate them, after they be subuerted at thy entring in, and thou require their ceremonies, saying: As these nations haue worshipped their goddes, so wil I also worshippe. <sup>31</sup> Thou shalt not doe in like maner to the Lord thy God. For al the abominations, that our Lord doeth abhorre, haue they done to their goddes, offering their sonnes and daughters, and bur<sup>32</sup>ning them with fyre.

# ANNOTATIONS.

## CHAP. XII.

<aside>That only do to our Lord.] VVheras the Gentiles offered their sonnes and daughters (v. 11.) and other abominable sacrifices to Idols, God commandeth his people to offer those things only, which are prescribed by the law, and neither to imolate anie other thing, nor exclude anie thing appointed by the same law for sacrifice. As for other preceptes, it is likewise forbid to adde or diminish anie thing that may corrupt the law: but was euer lawful for Superiours, to adde more preceptes agreable, and not contrarie to the former. So King Dauid established a new law that such as stayed with the baggage, should haue like portion of the praye, with those that fought in battel. 1. Reg. 30. And our Sauiour by his presence (Ioan 10.) approued the feast of dedication, instituted long after Moyses law. 1. Machab. 4.</aside>

[^1]: No hostes lawful in sacrifice but such as the law appointed

[^2]: New precepts may be added, not contrarie to the former:

## CHAP. XIII.

*False Prophets must be slaine, 6. how nere soeuer they be in kinred, or frendships. 12. The whole citie that shal permitte false doctrin must be vtterly destroyed, men, beastes, and al moueables, and neuer be built againe.*

<sup>1</sup> IF there rise in the middes of thee a prophete, or one that saieth he hath seene a dreame, and foretel a signe and a <sup>2</sup> wonder, and it come to passe which he spake, and he say to thee: Let vs goe, and folow strange goddes, which thou <sup>3</sup> knowest not, and let vs serue them: thou shalt not heare

[^3]: Noueltic in Religion is a marke of idolatrie or here-sie.
