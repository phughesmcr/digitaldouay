<sup>16</sup> And going vnto her, he said: Suffer me to lye with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter in law. Who answering: What wilt thou geue me that thou maiest enioy my companie? <sup>17</sup> He said: I wil send thee a kid out of the flockes. And when she said againe: I wil suffer that thou wilt, if thou geue me a pledge, til thou send that which thou doest promise; <sup>18</sup> Iudas said: What wilt thou to be geuen thee for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring, and bracelet, and staffe which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore by once companying conceaued, <sup>19</sup> and rising she went her way: and putting of the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood. <sup>20</sup> And Iudas sent a kid by his shephard the Odolamite, that he might receiue the pledge againe, which he had geuen to the woman: who when he had not found her, <sup>21</sup> he asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sate in the crosse way? Al making answere: There was no harlot in this place. <sup>22</sup> He returned to Iudas, and said to him: I haue not found her: yea the men also of that place said vnto me, that there neuer sate harlot there. <sup>23</sup> Iudas said: Let her take it to her, surely she can not charge vs with a lye, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didest not find her. <sup>24</sup> And behold after three moneths they told Iudas, saying: Thamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and her bellie semeth to swel. And Iudas said: Bring her forth that she may be burnt. <sup>25</sup> Who when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By that man, whose these things are, haue I conceaued: looke whose the ring is, and the bracelet, and the staffe. <sup>26</sup> Who acknowledging the giftes, said: She is iuster then I: because I did not geue her to Sela my sonne. But he knew her no more. <sup>27</sup> And when she was readie to be brought to bed, there appeared twinnes in her bellie: and in the verie deliuerie of the infants, one put forth the hand, wherin the midwife tyed a skarlet string, saying: <sup>28</sup> This shal come forth the former. <sup>29</sup> But he drawing backe his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition diuided for thee? and for this cause called his name Phares. <sup>30</sup> Afterward his brother came forth, in whose hand was the skarleter string: whom she called Zara.
