your generations. No other thing shal they possesse, <sup>24</sup> being
content with the oblation of tithes, which I haue separated
for their vses and necessaries. <sup>25</sup> And our Lord spake to
Moyses, saying: <sup>26</sup> Command the Leuites, and denounce
vnto them: When you shal receiue of the children of Israel
the tithes, which I haue geuen you, offer first fruites of them
to the Lord, that is to say, the tenth part of the tenth: <sup>27</sup> that
it may be reputed to you for an oblation of first fruites, as
wel of the barne floores as of the presses, <sup>28</sup> and of al thinges
wherof you receiue tithes, the first fruites offer to the Lord,
and geue them to Aaron the priest. <sup>29</sup> Al thinges that you
shal offer of the tithes, and shal separate for the giftes of the
Lord, they shal be the best and chosen thinges. <sup>30</sup> And thou
shalt say to them: If you offer al the goodlie and the better
thinges of the tithes, it shal be reputed to you as if you had
geuen first fruites of the barne floore and the presse: <sup>31</sup> and
you shal eate them in al your places, as wel you as your fami-
lies: because it is the reward for the ministerie, wherwith you
serue in the tabernacle of testimonie. <sup>32</sup> And you shal not
sinne in this point, reseruing the principal and fatte thinges
to your selues lest you pollute the oblations of the children
of Israel, and die.

AND our Lord spake to Moyses and Aaron, saying:
