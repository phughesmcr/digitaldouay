<sup>4</sup>men of euerie tribe be chosen of Israel to be sent to the
warre. <sup>5</sup>And they gaue a thousand of euerie tribe, that is to
say, twelue thousand wel appointed to fight: <sup>6</sup>whom Moy-
ses sent with Phinees the sonne of Eleazar the priest, and the
holie vessel, and the trumpettes to sound he deliuered to him.
<sup>7</sup>And when they had fought against the Madianites and had
ouercome, al the men they slew. <sup>8</sup>and their kinges: Eui, and
Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, fiue princes of the Na-
tion: Balaam also the sonne of Beor they killed with the
sword. <sup>9</sup>And they tooke their wiues, and litle ones, and al
their goodes: whatsoeuer they had bene able to make, they
spoiled: <sup>10</sup>as wel cities as townes and castels the fire did
consume. <sup>11</sup>And they tooke the praye, and al thinges that
they had taken as wel of men as of beastes, <sup>12</sup>and they
brought them to Moyses, and Eleazar the priest, and to al the
multitude of the children of Israel. but the rest of the imple-
mentes they caried to the campe in the champion countries
of Moab, beside Iordan against Iericho. <sup>13</sup>And Moyses and
Eleazar the priest went forth, and al the princes of the syna-
gogue to meete them without the campe. <sup>14</sup>And Moyses
being angrie with the princes of the hoste, the tribunes, and
the centurions that were come from the battle, <sup>15</sup>said:
Why haue you reserued the wemen? <sup>16</sup>Are not these they,
that deceiued the children of Israel at the suggestion of Ba-
laam, and made you preuaricate against our Lord vpon the
sinne of Phogor, wherevpon also the people was stroken?
<sup>17</sup>Therfore kil al whatsoeuer is of the male sexe, among the
litle ones also: and the wemen, that haue knowne men in
carnal copulation, slea ye: <sup>18</sup>but the gyrles and al the
wemen that are virgins reserue to you: <sup>19</sup>and tary with-
out the campe seuen dayes. He that hath killed a man, or
touched him that is killed, shal be expiated the third day and
the seuenth. <sup>20</sup>And of al the praye, whether it be garment,
or vessel, and some thing prepared for implementes, of
goates skinnes, and heare, and wood shal be expiated. <sup>21</sup>Elea-
zar also the priest spake to the hoste, that had fought, in this
maner: This is the precept of the law, which our Lord hath
commanded Moyses: <sup>22</sup>Gold, and siluer, and brasse, and
yron, and leade, and tinne, <sup>23</sup>and al that may passe through
the fyre, shal be purged by fyre, but whatsoeuer can not
