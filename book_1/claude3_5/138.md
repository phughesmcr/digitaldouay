### CHAP. XXXVII.

<aside>The least of sensible cause is alleaged, why Iacob loued Ioseph aboue the rest: God turneth euil to good effect. S. Aug. li. 14. c. 27. ciuit.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> In his old age ] This being one cause why Iacob loued Ioseph aboue al his other sonnes, for that he was the youngest of the eleuen (for Beniamin the twelfth was yet an infant) it is alleaged in holie Scripture (saith S. Chri-sostom. Epist. ad Olympiam) as least offensive to his bretheren. For a more special cause was, for his mother Rachels sake, but most principal cause of al was, for his great vertues, and mature iudgement; for which God also preferred him aboue them al, and now foreshewd the same by visions in sleepe. Which they enuying and meaning to preuent, did in deede vnwitting cooperate therto, Gods prouidence turning their euil worke to infinite good. As the same holie Ioseph truly interpreted it to them, after their fathers death, when they iustly feared reuenge, for so great and inhumane iniuries done vnto him. chap. 50. v. 20.

<aside>Graue for hel corruptly translated.</aside>

<sup>35</sup> Into hel mourning. ] Protestants denying more places for soules after this life, then Heauen for the iust, and Hel for the wicked, translate the hebrew word sheol, graue for hel. Because if they should grant that Iacob, or other holie fathers of the old Testament descended into hel, they must confesse some other hel, then where the damned are tormented, whither no Christian wil say those fathers went. If they contended only about the sense and meaning of the text, it were more tolerable, for therin they speake, according to their erronious opinion, as they thinke. But knowing as some of them doe, that Hel is the true word of the text, there is no sinceritie nor moral honestie in putting Graue, in place therof. And that they know it, the second table of the Bible, printed at London 1602. witnesseth, noting for a common place, that in the 37. chap. of Genesis. v. 35. Hel is taken for graue, therby confessing, that the true English word of the holie Scripture in that place is Hel, but that they would haue it to signifie graue. Wherupon anie reasonable man would thinke to finde the word Hel in the text, with some glosse to shew that graue were to be vnderstood. But in their Edition, also in that which was printed the yeare next folowing, 1603 wherto the same table is adioyned, they reade graue, and not hel in that place, though in some other places, they much disagree in translating the same word.

<aside>Iacob spake of hel, not of graue.</aside>

As for the sense, it can not be that Iacob ment the graue: for when he said he would goe to his sonne, he supposed him to be deuoured by a wild beast, and not buried in a graue. And therfore must necessarily meane, that he would goe where he thought the soule of his sonne to be. Which was neither in heauen, for then he would rather haue ascended thither ioyful, then descended to anie place mourning; neither did he meane the hel of the damned, for that had bene desperation; but to a lowe place, where the iust soules then remained in rest, which was called Limbus Patrum, or Abrahams bosome. That is, (saith S. Augustin, in his answere to Bishop Euodius (Epist. 99.) secreta quadam quietis habitatio. The habitation of a certaine e secret rest.
