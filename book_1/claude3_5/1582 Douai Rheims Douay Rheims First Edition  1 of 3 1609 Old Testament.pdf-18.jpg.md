The third from Abraham his going forth of his countrie, to the parting of the children of Israel out of Ægypt. Which some count to haue continued 720. Chro- yeares; others (whom we folow) but 430. And thus farre in the law of nolog. nature before the written law. The fourth age dureth 480. yeares, from S. Aug. the deliuerie of the children of Israel forth of Ægypt, to the fundation of the li. 15. c. Temple in Ierusalem.

And the sixth age dured about 640.yeares, from the Captiuitie of Babylon to Exo. 16. Christ. In al which times God was acknowledged and rightly serued, by 3.Reg.6. a continual visible Church, with true religion, and some (& no other) which 2.Esd.7. now that Church holdeth, that is called and knowen by the name of Catho- 1.Esdr.1 lique. As we intend, by Gods assistance, to shew by briefe Annotations, concerning diuers particular points now in Controuersie, as the holie Text giueth occasion. And especially by way of Recapitulation after euerie one of the six ages, when we come to those passages in the Historie, wherein the same are ended.

# OF MOYSES THE AVTHOR OF THE fiue first bookes.

[^2] Moyses (so called because he was taken from the water, as the name Exod. 6. signifieth) was borne in Ægypt, the sonne of Amram, the sonne Nu. 26. of Caath, the sonne of Leui the Patriarch, and soo of Iacob, Isaac, and 1.Par.6. Abraham. His maruelous deliuerie from drowning, his education, excellent Ioseph li. formes, singular wisdome, heroical vertues, rare dexteritie in al affayres, & 2.Antiq. whole life most admirable, are gathered out of holie Scriptures, by S. Gre- cap. 9. gorie Bishop of Nissa, into a briefe summe, most worthie to be read, but S. Aug. too large for this place. He was borne about the yeare of the world two thou- tr.88. de sand foure hundred, long before al prophane writers, yea before manie of temp. the Painimes false goddes, as S. Augustin declareth in diuers places of his S. Greg. most excellent worke intituled of the Citie of God. He liued in this world orat. yo 110. yeares. Of which 40. were in Pharaos court, as the adopted sonne of vitam Pharaos daughter: fourtie in banishment from Ægypt in Madian: and fourtie Moysis more he gouerned the people of Israel. His singular prayses are also briefly magni. touched in the last chapter of Deuteronomie, added by Iosue the booke of S. Aug. Ecclesiasticus. He died in the desert, and was buried in the vale of Moab, so li.18. ci- secretly that no mortal man knew his sepulchre, lest the Iewes, who were very uit.39. prone to Idolatrie, should haue adored his bodie with diuine honour, for the Deut.34. greatnes and multitude of his miracles, and for the singular estimation, they Eccle.45. had of him for the same.
