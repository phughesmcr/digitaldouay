his fathers house, allowing victuals to euerie one. <sup>13</sup> For in the whole world there wanted bread, and famine oppressed the land, especially of Ægypt and Chanaan. <sup>14</sup> Out of which he gethered together al the money for the selling of corne, and brought it in vnto the kings treasure. <sup>15</sup> And when the byers wanted money, al Ægypt came to Ioseph, saying: Geue vs bread: why die we before thee, our money fayling? <sup>16</sup> To whom he answered: Bring your cattel, and for them I wil geue you victuals, if you haue not to pay. <sup>17</sup> Which when they had brought, he gaue them sustenance for horses, and sheepe, and oxen, and asses: and he sustayned them that yeare for the exchange of the cattel. <sup>18</sup> And they came the second yeare, and said to him: We wil not conceale from our lord, that our money fayling, our cattel withal haue fayled: neither art thou ignorant, that we haue nothing besides our bodies and land. <sup>19</sup> Why therefore shal we die in thy sight? both we and our land wil be thyne: bye vs to be the kings bondmen, and geue vs sede, lest for default of tillers the land be turned into a wildernes. <sup>20</sup> Ioseph therefore bought al the Land of Ægypt, euery man selling his possessions for the greatnes of the famine. And he brought it vnder Pharaos handes, <sup>21</sup> and al the people therof from the fardest ends of Ægypt, euen to the vttermost coastes therof, <sup>22</sup> [^1] except the land of the Priests, which the king had deliuered them: to whom also a certaine alowance of victuals was geuen out of the comon barnes, and therfore they were not driuen to sel their possessions. <sup>23</sup> Ioseph therfore said to the people: Behold as you see, Pharao possesseth both you and your land: take sede, and sowe the fields, <sup>24</sup> that you may haue corne. The fifth part you shal geue to the king: the other foure I am content you shal haue for sede, and for foode to your families and your children. <sup>25</sup> Who answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let our lord haue a respect vnto vs, and we wil gladly serue the king. <sup>26</sup> From that time vntil this present day in the whole land of Ægypt, the fifth part is paied to the kings, and it became as it were a lawe, sauing the land of the priests, which was free from this condition. <sup>27</sup> Israel therefore dwelt in Ægypt, that is, in the Land of Gessen, and possessed it: and was increased, and multiplied exceedingly. <sup>28</sup> And he liued in it seuenteene yeares: and al the dayes of his life came to an hundred fourtie seuen yeares.
