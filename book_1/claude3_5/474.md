the fruite of thy cattel, and the fruites of thy Land: vntil
thou perish, and wil not leaue thee wheate, wine, and oile,
heardes of oxen, and flockes of sheepe: vntil it destroy thee,
<sup>52</sup> and consume thee in al thy cities, and thy strong and highe
walles be destroyed, wherin that hadst confidence in al thy
Land. Thou shalt be besieged within thy gates in al thy Land,
which our Lord thy God wil geue thee: <sup>53</sup> and thou shalt
eate the fruite of thy wombe, and the flesh of thy sonnes and
of thy daughters, which our Lord thy God shal geue thee,
in the distresse and vastation wherwith thyne enemie shal
oppresse thee. <sup>54</sup> The man that is delicate in thee, and very
riotious, shal much enuie his owne brother, and his wife,
that lieth in his bosome, <sup>55</sup> so that he shal not geue them of
the flesh of his children, which he wil eate: because he hath

al the wordes of this law, that be written in this volume,
and feare his name glorious and terrible, that is. Our
Lord thy God: <sup>59</sup> our Lord shal increase thy plagues, and
the plagues of thy seede, greate plagues and continuing,
sore infirmities and perpetual. <sup>60</sup> and he shal turne vpon thee
al the afflictions of Ã†gypt, which thou didst feare, and they
