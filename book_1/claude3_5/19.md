# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF GENESIS.

THIS first Booke of holie Scripture, called Genesis, which signifieth birth or beginning, was written by Moyses, when he was designed by God, to instruct & rule the children of Israel. As also the other foure bookes folowing. The Author and authoritie of al which fiue bookes, were euer acknowledged by the faithful, both of the old and new Testament: and so accounted and estemed by tradition, til Christ and his Apostles: who also confirmed them by their testimonies, and allegations of the same, as of holie Scriptures. From the creation vntil Moyses was (which was about two thousand and foure hundred yeares) the Church exercised Religion by Reuelations made to certaine Patriarches, and by Traditions from man to man, without anie Scriptures or Law written: But the peculiar people of God being more visibly separated from other nations, & manie errors abunding in the world, God would for correction & confutation therof, haue his wil made further knowen to his children, and so remaine amongst them in written record, by his faithful seruant and Prophet Moyses. Who therfore declareth the Author and beginning of al thinges, that is, How al creatures were made by God, and of him haue their being, and by him only are conserued. He teacheth expressly that there is one onlie God, against those that imagined and brought into the phantasies of men manie goddes. That the whole or vniuersal substance of heauen and earth, with their ornaments and accidents, were made in time; against those that thought the first fundation therof had euer benne. That God doth gouerne the same; against those that say, al is ruled by destenie or by the starres, and not by the continual prouidence of God. That God is a rewarder of the good, and a punisher of euil; which sinners seme, either not to know, or groslly to forgett. And that God created al for mans vse and benefite, which should make vs grateful. Wherfore holie Moyses more particularly describeth the beginning of man; what he was at first; how he fel; how al mankind is come of one man: deducing the Genealogie of Adam, especially to Noe. Then how men being more and more defiled vpon the earth, with wicked, especially carnal sinnes, were by Gods iust wrath drowned with an vniuersal floud.

Againe how a few reserued persons replenished the world anew. But this ofspring also falling into manie sinnes, especially Idolatrie and spiritual fornication, as those of the first age did to carnal offences, God stil conserued some faithful & true seruants. Of which Moyses specially pursueth the line of Noe by Sem his first begotten sonne. Then describeth the particular vocations, liues, maners, notable sayings, and noble factes, with sincere religion of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, & other holie Patriarches: who liued before the Written Law. Likewise vpon what occasion, & in what
