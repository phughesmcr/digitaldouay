LEVIT. CHAP. XXIII.

Ceremonial and they prefigured, in so much that now it is not lawful to keepe them, for it would signifie that Christ were not come, as S. Paul teacheth (Rom. 14. Ga-lat. 4. Coloss. 2. and in other places) and it were plaine Iudaisme, and Here-sie condemned by the Councel of Laodicea cap. 29. accursing them that Iudaize abstaining that day from worke. S. Gregorie also refuteth this heresie, li. 11. Epist. 3. shewing that Antichrist wil embrace it fauouring the Iewes: In place wherof the next day (which we cal sunday) is made a perpetual holie day, by authoritie of the Church, and called dies Dominica our Lords day (Apoc. 1.) And this change the Protestants confesse to be lawful and necessarie, though we haue no other expresse scripture, when, or by whom it was donne, but only that S. Iohn had his reuelation in our Lords day, but by perpetual tradi-tion al Christians know, that the day after the sabbath is our weeklie holie day, in memorie of Christs Resurrection the same day, and in figure of the general resurrection of al men, and of life euerlasting to the blessed. S. Aug. li. 22. c. 30. ciuit. & Epist. 119. c. 15. and S. Hierome Epist. ad Hedib. The same reason and authoritie do also warrant the change of other feastes, and insti-tution of new, in honour of God, our Sauiour Iesus Christ, his Mother, and other Sainctes, and in memorie of benefites receiued, as here we see in the old Testament diuers were commanded by God, some also instituted long after Moyses, as by Mardocheus and other Iewes, Ester. 9. and the festiua-tion with new dedication of the altar 1. Machab. 4. obserued by our Sauiour Ioan. 10. v. 22.
