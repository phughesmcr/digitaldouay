Genesis.

of nature, or now writ not in the law of grace (as Protestantes say there is not) there were no law at al. See more of this point in the Annotations, chap. 7. ad Hebre. Here we only observe that Abel, Seth, Enos, and other Patriarches were Priestes, and exercised priestlie functions: yea Cain also was a Priest (though a bad one) and offered Sacrifice.

But external offices or ministeries, without a wel disposed mind, and sincere vertues producing Good workes, did never iustifie anie man. And therfore Cains Sacrifice, offered with a perverse mind, was not respected by God, as Abels was: Wherupon he becoming worse, and more malitious, God sharply reproued his anger and enuie, conceaued without iust cause, saying: <sup>7</sup>If thou doest wel, shalt thou not receiue againe: but if thou doest il, shal not thy sinne forthwith be present at the dore: derly shewing that euerie one shal receiue according to his workes.

This place also euidently sheweth Free-wil, yea in a wicked man. For this expostulation had neuer benne vttered, by our most reasonable Lord, and Maister, if Cain had benne depriued of freewil. For he might haue excused himselfe, and most needes haue benne holden excused, if he had benne forced to do as he did. But God charged him as inexcusable, and as one that knew, or ought to know, that he had freewil. And this further inculcates, that he had, and should haue power, and freewil ouer his concupiscence, to correct the same, if he would, saying: <sup>7</sup>The lust therof shal be vnder thee, and thou shalt haue dominion ouer it. So that no sinner, be he neuer so wicked, much lesse a iust man, lacketh freewil, yet Luther abhorreth the very word, and Caluin wisheth it out of the world.

Temporal punishment is proued to be due for sinne remitted, by that both death, and other penalties are inflicted, by Gods iustice vpon men, after iustification, and by the particular punishmentes laid vpon Adam and Eve, confessing their faultes.

Purgatorie is also proued by the same iustice of God. For when anie dieth penitent, and yet haue not made ful satisfaction, they must suffer for that remaineth after death, and be purged, before they can enter into rest. which remnant of debt our B. Sauiour calleth <sup>5</sup>The last farthing, and saith, it must be payed. The Iewes also at this day hold the doctrin of Purgatorie by tradition. And consequently they Pray for soules departed, not only to God, but also to the ancient Patriarches (which likewise sheweth Inuocation of Sainctes) in these wordes: Yee fathers which sleepe in Hebron, open to him the gates of Eden. that is of Paradise, which was planted in Eden. And Hebron is the place where Adam was buried, and his sepulcher religiously conserued in the time of Iosue, aboue 1500 yeares after his death. The same is the place which Abraham bought, and there buried Sara: where also himselfe, and Isaac, and Iacob were buried: and to which finally the bo-
