<sup>14</sup> more see for euer. Our Lord wil fight for you, and you shal
hold your peace. <sup>15</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Why
criest thou to me? speake to the children of Israel that they
goe forward. <sup>16</sup> But thou lift vp thy rodde, and stretch forth
thy hand vpon the sea, & diuide it: that the children of Israel
may goe in the middes of the sea by drie ground. <sup>17</sup> And I
wil indurate the hart of the Ægyptians to pursue you: and
I wil be glorified in Pharao, and in al his hoste, and in his chariotes
and in his horsemen. <sup>18</sup> And the Ægyptians shal know
that I am the Lord when I shal be glorified in Pharao, and in
his chariottes & in his horsemen. <sup>19</sup> And the Angel of God,
that went before the campe of Israel, remouing him selfe,
went behind them: and together with him the piller of the
cloude, leauing the foreward, <sup>20</sup> stode behind, between the Ægyptians
campe and the campe of Israel: and it was a darke
cloud, and lightning the night, so that they could not come
to ech other the whole night time. <sup>21</sup> And when Moyses had
stretched forth his hand vpon the sea, our Lord tooke it away,
a vehement and burning winde blowing al the night, and turned
it into drie ground: and the water was diuided. <sup>22</sup> And
the children of Israel went through the middes of the drie sea:
for the water was as it were a wal on their right hand & their
left. <sup>23</sup> And the Ægyptians pursuing went in after them, and
al Pharaoes horses, his chariottes and horsemen through the
middes of the sea. <sup>24</sup> And now the morning watch was come,
and behold our Lord looking vpon the Ægyptians campe
through the piller of fire & the cloude, slew their armie: <sup>25</sup> and
ouerthrew the wheeles of the chariottes, and they were
borne into the depth. The Ægyptians therfore said: Let vs
flee from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against vs.
<sup>26</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Stretch forth thy hand
vpon the sea, that the waters may returne to the Ægyptians
vpon their chariottes and horsemen. <sup>27</sup> And when Moyses
had stretched forth his hand against the sea, it returned in the
first breake of day to the former place: and the Ægyptians
fleeing away, the waters came vpon them, and our Lord enwrapt
them in the middes of the waues. <sup>28</sup> And the waters returned,
and ouerwhelmed the chariottes and the horsemen of
al Pharaoes armie, who folowing were entred into the sea,
<sup>29</sup> neither did there so much as one of them remaine. But the
children of Israel marched through the middes of the drie sea,
