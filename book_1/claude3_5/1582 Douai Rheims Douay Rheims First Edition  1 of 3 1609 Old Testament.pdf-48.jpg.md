there nothing (though al, or most chanced to them in figure) that euer more liuely, or more exactly prefigured Christ and his Church, with the rest of mankind, then did Noe and the arke, & the drowning of the rest of the world in that deluge. Which S. Augustin declareth in many places, but especially and of purpose in his twelth booke against Faustus the Manichee, from the 14. chapter to the 22. and in his fifteenth booke of the citie of God, in the two last chapters: where he sheweth at large both the certaintie of Noes historie, and that as certainly it was a figure of things in the new Testament, and withal the great congruitie betwen the figure & the things figured. The same did Origen explicate (homil. 2. in Gen.) S. Gregorie (homil 12. in Ezech.) Rupertus (li. 4. comment. in Gen. c. 7. & sequent.) and diuers other ancient Doctors, confirming their expositions by S. Peters testimonie, saying: *In the arke a few, that is eight soules* (or persons) *were saued* (from drowning) *by water, whereunto Baptisme being of the like forme now saueth vs*. And by our Sauiours wordes saying: *As in the dayes of Noe, so shal also the comming of the Sonne of man be*. In summe the Doctors teach, that Noe signified Christ, the verie rest of mans soule. Whom whosoeuer foloweth shal find rest for their soules. The arke signifieth the Church, the forme therof being six times so long as broad, and tenne times so long as hiegh, resembleth the proportion of mans bodie, lying prone or prostrate. The dore in the side representeth the wound in Christs side, from whence flowed the holie Sacraments, by which the faithful enter into the Church, and are sanctified. The timber wherof the arke is made, & the water bearing it vp, signified the Crosse of Christ and Baptisme. *For as Noe* (saith S. Augustin) *with his, was deliuered by the wood and the water, so the familie of Christ by Baptisme signed with Christs passion on the Crosse*. Likewise the squarenes of the timber which both sustayned the burden of al contayned in the arke, and resisted the boystrous waues of the floud beating without, did signifie firme men in the Church, as he construeth stand firmly in al sortes of tentations: especially godlie & lerned Doctors and Pastors, who by words and example vphold and confirme the faithful people in afflictions within, and withstand and conuince al Heretikes, and other Infidels that oppugne the Church without. Againe the higher & lower rowmes with the midle chambers & third loftes, & other distinctions of cabinets, and partitions, and al sortes of liuing creatures cleane and vncleane, receiued therin, did signifie the varieties of al states & functions, and diuersitie of maners and merites in the Church, in which are persons of al degrees, Clergie and Laicie, Potentates, Princes, subiects, good and euil. The most strong kind of glew called *bitumen*, signified the permanent or euerlasting stabilitie, and vnseparable coniunction of the Church, by the grace and continual assistance of the Holie Ghost conferuing the same. The consummation of the arke in one cubite signified the vnitie of the same Church, which is one in al times, and places. Neither would God almightie haue manie arkes, for Noe and his sonnes or other creatures, nor manie chiefe rulers (though he would that of them should come manie Nations) but one only arke, and one chiefe gouernour therof, and that al without the same should corporally dye, to signifie that al which dye without the Church do perish, and are eternally damned. wherupon S. Hierom, amongst other Fathers, sheweth that al within the Church, that communicate with the Sea Apostolique (wherin S. Damasus fate the gouernour) are as those in the arke of Noe, and al Schismatikes, Heretikes and other Infidels are in like case, with the rest of the world, that were drowned with the floud.

The end of the first age.
