True and false Prophetes: DEVTERONOMIE.

thou be not willing to imitate the abominations of those nations. <sup>10</sup> Neither let there be found in thee any that shal expiate his sonne, or daughter, making them to passe through the fyre: or that demandeth of southsayers, and obserueth dreames and diuinations, neither let there be a sorcerer, <sup>11</sup> nor inchanter, nor that consulteth with pythones, or diuiners, and seeketh the truth of the dead. <sup>12</sup> For al these thinges our Lord abhorreth, and for these abominations wil he destroy them at thy entring in. <sup>13</sup> Thou shalt be perfect, and without spotte with our Lord thy God. <sup>14</sup> These nations, whose land thou shalt possesse, heare southsayers and diuiners: but thou art otherwise instructed of our Lord thy God. <sup>15</sup> A PROPHET of thy nation and of thy brethren like vnto me, wil our Lord thy God raise vp to thee: him thou shalt heare, <sup>16</sup> as thou didst request of our Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assemblie was gathered, and saidst: I wil no more heare the voice of our Lord my God, and this exceding great fire I wil see no more, lest I die. <sup>17</sup> And our Lord said to me: They haue spoken al thinges wel. <sup>18</sup> A prophete wil I rayse vp to them out of the middes of their brethren like to thee: and I wil put my wordes in his mouth, and he shal speake al thinges that I shal command him. <sup>19</sup> But he that wil not heare his wordes, which he shal speake in my name, I wil be the reuenger. <sup>20</sup> And the prophet that being depraued with arrogancie wil speake in my name, the thinges that I did not command him to say, or in the name of strange goddes, shal be slaine. <sup>21</sup> And if in secrete cogitation thou answer: How shal I vnderstand the word, that our Lord spake not? <sup>22</sup> This signe thou shalt haue: That which the same prophete foretelleth, in the name of the Lord and cometh not to passe: that our Lord hath not spoken, but by the arrogancie of his minde the prophet hath forged it: and therefore thou shalt not feare him.

CHAP. XVIII.

[^1] *A PROPHET of thy nation.*] Amongst other places this plainly proueth the same wordes in holie Scripture may haue diuers literal senses. For first the coherence of the text sheweth, that God here promised to geue his people an other extraordinarie prophet, after Moyses death, of their owne nation: as wel to take away occasion of seeking to southsayers, diuiners, and other prophane prophetes of false goddes, strictly forbidden in the wordes
