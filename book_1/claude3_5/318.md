because it is abomination. <sup>23</sup>With no beast shalt thou com-
panie, neither shalt thou be polluted with it. A woman shal
not lie downe to a beast, nor companie with it: because it is
an hainous fact. <sup>24</sup>Neither be ye polluted in anie of the
thinges wherwith al the nations haue bene contaminated,
which I wil cast out before your sight, <sup>25</sup>and wherwith the
land is polluted: whose abominations I wil visite, that it
vomite out the inhabitants therof. <sup>26</sup>Keepe my ordinances
and iudgements, and doe not any of these abominations, as
wel the same countrieman as the stranger, that seiourneth
with you. <sup>27</sup>For al these execrable thinges did the inhabi-
tants of the land, that haue bene before you, and haue pol-
luted it. <sup>28</sup>Beware therfore lest in like maner it vomite out
you also, when you shal doe the like thinges, as it vomited
out the nation that was before you. <sup>29</sup>Euerie soule, that shal
doe anie of these abominations, shal perish from the
middes of his people. <sup>30</sup>Keepe my commandements. Doe
not the thinges which they haue done, that haue bene be-
fore you, and be not polluted in them: I the Lord your God.

<aside>Mariage for-
bid in al de-
grees in the
right line, by
the law of na-
ture.
Secondarily in
the first colla-
teral degree of
consanguinitie.</aside>

[^1] *Next of his bloud.*] Mariage is forbid first and most strictly by the law of
nature, in al degrees in the right line ascending and decending, both in con-
sanguinitie and affinitie. S. Paul testifying that *among the heathen, no man would
haue his fathers wife*. And in the right line God him selfe (who onlie can) neuer
dispensed. Secondarily, the first collateral degree in consanguinitie, that is,
between brother and sister, by one parent, or by both, is also vnlawful by the
law of nature, except in the beginning of the world, when Adams children
must needes marie together, God so ordayning that al mankind should be pro-
pagated by one man (for of him also the first woman was made) but after this
beginning it was neuer allowed, nor perhaps can be dispensed withal, at least
neuer was by anie man. Though Beza (*li. de repudijs & diuortijs*) and some En-

glish Bezites charge Pope Martin the fifth, to haue dispensed with one, that
had maried his owne natural sister: which is a false reporte. For it was with
one, who hauing committed fornication with one sister, afterwardes ma-
ried the other, from whom he could not be separated without great scandal,
the pretended mariage being publike, and the impediment secrete: as S. Anto-
ninus witnesseth. *par. 3. tit. 1. ca. 11.* But besides the right line, and the
first collateral degree in consanguinitie, no other collateral degrees are pro-
hibited by the law of nature, but by positiue only. So this present law, written
by Moyses, forbade to marie in the first collateral degree of affinitie, but the
same law commanded (*Deut. 25.*) that in case a maried man died without
issue, his brother should marie the widow. Whereby is clere that this degree,
and others more remote, were not prohibited by the law of nature. For then
