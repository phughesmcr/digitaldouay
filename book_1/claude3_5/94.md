<aside>Separation to be made in families, when iust cause requireth.</aside>

[^1] Let it not ] It semed so hard, inhumaine, and vniust to cast Agar and Ismael out of the house, that Abraham would not haue done it, onles God had commanded him in this to heare the voice of Sara. But when he knew Gods wil therin, not respecting flesh and bloud, nor disputing further of the lawfulnes of the fact, sent them both away, commending them to Gods protection: and so by this separation the familie was made quiet. It represented also a notable Mysterie of the Synagog of the Iewes & Church of Christ. As S. Augustin doth excellently expound the same, according to S. Paul (Gal. 4.) That Ismaels playing with Isaac was persecution, because it tended to peruert him; shewing it to be a greater iniurie, to delude and deceiue anie, in drawing them to new and particular companies, then corporally to persecute them: and that the Church, and Catholique Princes punish heretikes for their good, to make them returne to the truth, or finally to cease from seducing others. *Ecce libera afflixit ancillam, & non illam vocat persecutionem Apostolus, ludit seruus cum domino, & persecutionem vocat*. Behold the freewoman afflicted the handmaid, and the Apostle calleth it not persecution, the seruant played with the maister, and he calleth it persecution. This affliction is not called persecution, and that play is called persecution. Againe, he (by eth of Sara, *Eiice ancillam & filium eius*) saith: She saw some play in that play, she noted the seruants pride, it displeased her, she cast him forth of the dore. S. Hierom also teacheth that the spiritual neuer persecuteth the carnal: but beareth him as his rustical brother, knowing that he may in time be profitable.

<aside>Mystical sense</aside>

<aside>The true Church doth not persecute but iustly punisheth offenders.</aside>

<aside>Heretikes and other infidels do persecute when either by word, or sword they impugne the truth.</aside>
