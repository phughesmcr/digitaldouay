not the other. God also for a time suffered Simon Magus to make shew of miracles, and at last (as Egesippus *li. 3. de excid. Hieroſol. c. 2.* and manie others testifie) to flie in the ayre, as though he would haue ascended into heauen, but S. Peter praying to God, the magician notwithstanding his wings wherewith he presumed to flie, fel downe and broke his legges, that he could not goe. To omitte manie examples, Gregorius Turonensis *li. 2. hiſt. Franc. c. 3.* witnesseth, that one Cyrola an Arian Patriarch, pretending to obtaine of God sight to a man, that feined him selfe blind, the man was presently blind in deede, and exclaiming cryed: Take here thy money which thou gauest me, to deceiue the world, restore me my sight, which I had euen now, and by thy persuasion, and for this money, I feined to want. It happened worse to one Bruley a poore man in Geneua, whom Caluin with wordes and money perswaded to feine him selfe dead, and so pretending to raise him to life, the man was found dead in deede, and not he but his wife (hauing consented to the deuise) lamented in earnest, enueighing against that false Apostle, calling him a secrete thefe, and a wicked murderer, that had killed her husband. So writeth M. Ierom Bolseck *in vita Caluini*. And besides the womans vnexpected outcrie, and detestation, that her husband was not dead before, but that through Caluins perswasions, and promises to relieue them with almes, they so feined, al Geneua did knowe, that Caluin endeuoured to raise the man, and could not. These and manie others haue attempted and could do nothing, but against them selues.

<aside>Gods prouidence in most danger.</aside>

At the dangers when in deede wonders are done that may seme to be miracles Against such therfore Gods prouidence more particularly assisteth his seruantes diuers wayes. First he warneth al to stand fast when such tentations happen, Deut. 13. If there rise among you a prophet, or one that sayeth, he hath sene a dreame, and foretelleth a signe, and a wonder, and it cometh to passe which he spake, and he saye thee: Let vs goe & folow strange goddes, whom thou knowest not, and let vs serue them, thou shalt not heare the wordes of that prophet, or dreamer. In like maner our Sauiour foretelling that false chri- <sup>Mat. 24.</sup> stes, & false-prophetes, shal by great signes & wonders seduce many, warneth al saying: Loe I haue foretold you. If therfore they shal say vnto you: He is in the desert, goe not out. Behold he is in the closets, belieue it not. Secondly God suffered not the Enchanters of Ægypt, nor Simon Magus long: and for the elect, the dayes of Antichrists dangerous persecution shal be shortened. Thirdly holy Scripture so describeth Antichrist, and his actes, as when he cometh he may be sooner knowen. Our Sauiour saith: The Iewes wil receiue him, S. Paul <sup>Ioan 5. 2. Thes. 2.</sup> calleth him *the man of sinne*, importing one singular man, and the same replete with al wickednes. *exalted aboue al that is called God, or is worshipped*. Neither worshipping true God, nor other false God aboue him selfe. He shal be deadly wounded and cured. Not only he shal shew strange wonders, but also one of his <sup>Apoc. 13.</sup> prophetes shal bring fire from the firmament, & his image shal speake. Fourthly as our Lord gaue powre and authoritie to his great Prophet Moyses, against the Ægyptian Enchanters, in the end of the law of nature, before the written law: and to his first chief vicar S. Peter, in the beginning of the law of grace, to control & confound Simon Magus: so he wil send his two reserued great Pro- <sup>Apoc. 11.</sup> phetes Enoch and Elias nere the end of the world, to resist Antichrist, and to teach, testifie, and confirme with their bloud the doctrin of Christ. For they shal be slaine, and rise againe after three dayes, and ascend into heauen. Then <sup>Apoc. 19.</sup> Antichrist holding him selfe most secure, shal sudainly be destroyed. *2. Thes. 2. 20.*
