and the whole Church beleeueth) was preserued from that death, and so vndoubtedly were Seth, and Enos being most holie. and the rest here recoun­ted, as is most probable. Neuerthelesse for further confutation of the contra­rie opinion of Protestants, the reader may also obserue the iudgement of S. Chrisostom, who affirmeth that *Though it be not a matter of faith, whether Enoch be now in Paradise from whence Adam and Eue were expelled, or in some other plea­sant place: Dicunt tamen sacræ scripturæ quod Deus transtulit eum, & quod viuentem transtulit eum, quod mortum ipse non sit expertus. The holie Scriptures say that God trans­lated him, and that he translated him liuing, that he did not (or hath not experienced) death.* And S. Augustin as expresly saith: *Non mortuus, sed tamen translatus est. He (to wit Enoch) is translated, not dead but aliue.* Yea he teacheth how his life is sustayned thus many thousand yeares vpon earth. And sheweth moreouer that both Enoch and Elias shal dye. For *seing Enoch and Elias* (saith he) *are dead in Adam, and carying the ofspring of death in their flesh, to pay that debt, are to returne to this life (of common conuersation) and to pay that debt which is long deferred.*

Diuerse reasons are also alleaged, why God would reserue these two aliue. First to shew by example, that as their mortal bodies are long conserued from corupting or decaying, in like sorte Adam and Eue and al other men damned should haue bene conserued, and according to Gods promise, neuer haue died, but after some good time translated to heauen, and inioyed with immortalitie. Secondly to giue vs an argument of immortalitie, which is promised after the general Resurrection. For seing God doth preserue some mortal, so long from al infirmitie, we may assuredly beleiue that he wil geue immortal & eternal life to those and soule, to his Sainctes, after they haue payed the debt of death, and are risen againe. Thirdly these two (one of the law of nature, the other of the law of Moyses) are preserued aliue, to come amongst men againe towards the end of the world, to teach, testifie, and defend the true faith and doctrin of Christ, against Antichrist, when he shal most violently oppugne & persecute the Church. Of Enoch it is said in the booke of Ecclesiasticus, that he was translated, *vt det gentibus pœnitentiam, that he geue repentance to the nations*, by his preaching, & reducing the deceiued from Antichrist. And of Elias Malachie prophesieth, that he *shal come before the great and terrible day of our Lord, and shal turne the hart of the fathers* (that is the people of the Iewes) *to the sonnes* (the Christians) *and of the sonnes* (the deceiued Christians) *to the fathers*, the ancient true Catholiques.
