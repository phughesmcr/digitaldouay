slaine; in the sight of their people, because they haue reuealed one an others turpitude, and they shal beare their iniquitie. <sup>18</sup> He that compaineth with a woman in her menstrual fluxe, and reueaketh her turpitude, and she openeth the fountaine of her bloud, both shal be destroyed out of the middes of their people. <sup>19</sup> The turpitude of thy aunt by thy mother, and of thy aunt by thy father, thou shalt not discouer: he that doeth this, hath disclosed the ignominie of his flesh, both shal beare their iniquitie. <sup>20</sup> He that compaineth with the wife of his vncle by the father, or of his vncle by the mother, and reuelaeth the ignominie of his kinred, both shal beare their sinne: without children they shal die. <sup>21</sup> He that marieth his brothers wife, doth an vnlawful thing, he hath reuealed his brothers turpitude: they shal be without children. <sup>22</sup> Keepe my lawes, and iudgements, and doe them: lest the land which you shal enter into and inhabite, vomite out you also. <sup>23</sup> Walke not in the ordinances of the nations, which I wil expel before you. For al these thinges haue they done, and I haue abhorred them. <sup>24</sup> But to you I speake: Possesse their land, which I wil geue you for an inheritance, a land flowing with milke and honie. I the Lord your God, that haue seperated you from other peoples. <sup>25</sup> Therfore doe you also seperate the cleane beast, from the vncleane, and the cleane foule from the vncleane: pollute not your soules, in beastes, and birdes, and al thinges that moue on the earth, and which I haue shewed vnto you, to be polluted. <sup>26</sup> You shal be holie vnto me, because I the Lord am holie, and I haue separated you from other peoples, that you should be mine. <sup>27</sup> Man, or woman, in whom is a pythonical or diuining spirite, dying let them die, they shal stone them: their bloud be vpon them.

The high Priest shal not vncouer his head, nor rent his garment, nor be present at anie funeral, nor at al goe forth of the holie place. 13. When he marieth he must take a virgin. 16. None that hath a blemish in his bodie (though he be of Aarons stock) shal minister in the Sanctuarie, nor approch to the Altar.*

<aside>but in the first collateral of affinitie, and in the second collateral degree as wel of consanguinitie, as affinitie, with lesse punishment.</aside>

<aside>Which sheweth greater obligation, & greater sinne, concerning the rightline, then the collateral; also in the first degree of consanguinitie then in the second; and more in consanguinitie then in affinitie.</aside>

<aside>::Not for euerie kind of sinne (though euerie one is punishable,) but for the more hainous, & for altogether the Chananites were cast out of their land.</aside>
