Genesis

to be able, vntil I come to my lord in Seir. <sup>15</sup> Esau answered: I beseech thee, that of my people at the least wise, which is with me, there may remaine some to accompanie thee in the way. It is not needful, said he, this only I haue nede of, that I may finde grace (my lord) in thy sight. <sup>16</sup> Esau therfore returned that day the same way, that he came into Seir. <sup>17</sup> And Iacob cometh into Socoth: where hauing built a house, and pitched his tents, he called the name of that place Socoth, that is, Tabernacles. <sup>18</sup> And he passed into Salem a citie of the Sichimites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt beside the towne. <sup>19</sup> And he bought that part of the field, wherin he had pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of Sichem for an hundred lambes. <sup>20</sup> And erecting an altar there, on it he called vpon the most mightie God of Israel.
