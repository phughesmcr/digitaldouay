malediction, and an example of al among his people: make
he thy thigh to rotte, and bellie swelling burst asunder. <sup>22</sup>the
cursed water enter into thy bellie, and thy wombe being
swolne let thy thigh rotte. And the woman shal answer,
Amen, amen. <sup>23</sup>And the priest shal write these curses in a
booke, and shal wash them out with the most bitter waters:
<sup>24</sup>wherupon he heaped the curses, <sup>25</sup>and he shal geue them
her to drinke. Which when she hath drunke vp, <sup>26</sup>the priest
shal take of her hand the sacrifice of ieloufie, and shal eleuate
it before the Lord, and shal put it vpon the altar: <sup>27</sup>yet so not-
withstanding that first, he take a handful of the sacrifice of
that, which is offered, & burne it vpon the altar: and so geue
the most bitter waters to the woman to drinke. <sup>28</sup>Which
when she hath drunke, if she be polluted, and by contempt
of her husband guiltie of adulterie, the waters of malediction
shal goe through her, and her bellie being puft vp her thigh
shal rotte withal: and the woman shal be for a malediction,
and an example to al the people. <sup>29</sup>But if she be not polluted,
she shal be blameless, and shal beare children. <sup>30</sup>This is the
law of ieloufie. If the woman decline from her husband, and
if she be polluted, <sup>31</sup>and the husband stirred with the spirit
of ieloufie brought her in the sight of the Lord, and the priest
haue done to her according to al thinges that are written:
<sup>32</sup>the husband shal be without fault, and she shal beare her
iniquitie.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. V.

[^1] General confession (such as Protestantes make)
sufficed not here for purging sinnes: but whosoeuer transgressed anie of Gods
commandments, were bound by this diuine positiue law, to confesse expresly
and distinctly their sinne, which in particular they had committed. Also to make
restitution, if wrong were donne to anie other, with a fifth part aboue the
principal. And for further satisfaction to God they must offer sacrifice. Al
which did plainly prefigure & foreshew the necessitie of particular confession
of sinnes, and satisfaction, in the Sacrament of Penance, instituted by Christ.
*Ioan. 20.*
