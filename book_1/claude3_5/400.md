[^1]: Temporal princes are also pastors, or shepherds of the people: but this made not Iosue su- preme in spiri- tual causes. For it is clere in the next lines that he had but part of Moy- ses glorie, or office, and that was to be tem- poral prince, Eleazar being chief in causes spiritual, before whom and the multitude he was ordained Duke, but Elea- zar consulted God for him, and directed his prin cipal actions, called here his going out, and going in.

<sup>16</sup> Our Lord the God of the spirites of al flesh prouide a man, <sup>17</sup> that may be ouer this multitude: and may goe out and enter in before them, and bring them out, or bring them in: lest the people of our Lord be as sheepe without a pastor. <sup>18</sup> And our Lord said to him: Take Iosue the sonne of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand vpon him. <sup>19</sup> Who shal stand before Eleazar the priest and al the multi- <sup>20</sup> tude: and thou shalt geue him preceptes in the sight of al, and part of thy glorie, that al the synagogue of the children of Israel may heare him. <sup>21</sup> For him, if anie thing be to be done, Eleazar the priest shal consult the Lord. At his word shal he goe out and shal goe in, and al the children of Israel with him, and the rest of the multitude. <sup>22</sup> Moyses did as our Lord had commanded. And when he had taken Iosue, he sette him before Eleazar the priest, and al the assemblie of the people. <sup>23</sup> And imposing his handes on his head, he repeted al thinges that our Lord had commanded.

<sup>1</sup> OVR Lord also said to Moyses: Command the chil- <sup>2</sup> dren of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: My oblation and breades, and burnt sacrifice of most sweete odour offer ye in their times. <sup>3</sup> These are the sacrifices which you must offer: Two lambes of a yeare old without blemish daily for the euerlasting holocaust: <sup>4</sup> one you shal offer in the morning, and the other at euen: <sup>5</sup> the tenth part of an ephi of floure, which shal be tempered with the purest oile, and shal haue the fourth part of an hin. <sup>6</sup> It is the continual ho- locaust which you offered in Mount Sinai for a most sweete odour of the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. <sup>7</sup> and for a liba- ment you shal offer of wine the fourth part of an hin for e- <sup>8</sup> uerie lambe in the Sanctuarie of the Lord. And the other lambe in like maner you shal offer at euen according to al the rite of the morning sacrifice, and of the libamentes therof, an oblation of most sweete odour to the Lord. <sup>9</sup> And on the day of the Sabbath, you shal offer two lambes of a yeare old without blemish, and two tenthes of flowre tempered
