destroyed. As S. Hilarie (*lib. 7. de Trinitate*) & S. Gregorie (*lib. 8. in Ezech.*) note vpon this place. Likewise Priestes are called goddes (*Exod. 22. v. 28.*) for their sacred function, pertaining to Religion and Seruice of God. Prophetes also are called *videntes, Seers* (*1. Reg. 9.*) because by participation of diuine knowledge, they see sometimes the secretes of other mens hartes, things supernatural, and future contingent, though properly and naturally onlie God almightie is *Scrutator cordis, the searcher of the hart* and knoweth al things (*Sap. 1.*) Againe S. Peter saith (*1. Epist. c. 1.*) that iust men are made partakers of diuine nature. VVhich is rather more then to participate in name. Al which titles rightly pertei- ned to Moyses, being in life Holie, in knowledge a Prophete, in function a <sup>4</sup>Priest, and in powre a Prince. In the same sense of participation, Saintes are called our Mediators, Aduocates, Redeemers, Deliuerers, and the like.

3. *Truly indurare*] According to our purpose mentioned in the Annotations vpon the 9. chap. to the Romanes, we shal here recite the summe of S. Augu- stins doctrine (*Ser. 88. de tempore*) touching the hard question: How God did indurate Pharaoes hart. And withal we shal briefly explicate, according to the doctrine of the same, & other most learned Fathers of the Church, the true sense of this and like places, by which Zuinglius, Caluin, Beza, and other Se- ctaries, would proue that God not only permitteth, but also commandeth, in- clineth, inforceth, and compelleth men to do that which is sinne: yea that God is the author, internal mouer, & inforcer, that man transgresseth; though they denie that God sinneth, or is cause of the malice of sinne. For exãple, Zuin- glius (*art. de prouidentia Dei, ca. 5*) saith: *Numinis ipsius author est eius, quod nobis est iniustitia, illi vero nullatenus est. The diuine power it self is author of that thing, which to vs is iniustice, but to him in no wyse is*. And a litle after, *Cum igitur Angelum trans- gressorem facit, & hominem, ipse tamen transgressor non constituitur. VVhen therfore God maketh Angel, and man transgressor, yet himself is not made a transgressor*. Cha. 6. *Vnum igitur atque idem facinus, puta adulterium aut homicidium, quantum Dei est au- ctoris, motoris, impulsoris, opus est, crimen non est: quantum hominis est, crimen ac scelus est. Therfore the self same act, as adulterie or manslaughter, as it is of God the author, mouer, inforcer, is a worke, is not a crime: but as it is of man, is a crime, & a wicked act*. Caluin (*li. 1. instit. c. 17. para. 11.*) affirmeth that the diuel, & the whole band of the wicked can not conceiue, not endeuour, nor doe anie mis- chief, *nisi quantum Deus permiserit, imo nisi quantum ille mandauit. but so farre as God permitteth (which al Catholiques firmly beleue) nay but so far as he cõman- deth*: which al Catholiques abhorre and detest. Likewise (*li. 2. c. 4. para. 4*) alleaging Gods wordes, saying *he had aggravated, and hardned Pharaoes hart*, affirmeth, that which God did more, besides not mollifying his hart, was, *quod obstinationepectus eius obfirmandum Satanæ mandauit, that he committed his hart to Satan to be obdurated with obstinacie*: making God the author, and Satan only the minister of hardning Pharaos hart. Beza folowing this race (*in Respon. ad Castellionem, Aphorismo 22.*) saith, God so worketh by euil instruments, that he doth not only suffer them to worke, nor only moderateth the euent, *sed etiam excitat, impellit, mouet, regit, atque adeo (quod omnium est maximum) etiam creat, vt per illa agat quod constituit*: but also stirreth them vp, driueth them forward, moueth them, ruleth them, and (which is most of al) euen createth them, that by them he may worke that which he appointed. *Al which* (saith he) *God doth iustly, and without anie iniustice*. So in deede these men say, when they presed with the blasphemous absurditie, that they make God author and cause of sinne, which necessarily and euidently foloweth of their doctrin. For by the very light of nature, it is clere, that the commander or inforcer is author of that
