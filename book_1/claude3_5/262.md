sonne of Hur of the tribe of Iuda, <sup>3</sup> and I haue replenished him with the spirit of God, with wisdome, & vnderstanding, and knowledge in al worke, <sup>4</sup> to deuise whatsoeuer may be artificially made of gold, and siluer, and brasse, <sup>5</sup> of marble, and precious stones, and diuersitie of wood. <sup>6</sup> And I haue geuen him for his felow Ooliab the sonne of Achisa-mech of the tribe of Dan. And in the hart of euerie skilful man haue I put wisdome: that they may make al things which I haue commanded thee, <sup>7</sup> the tabernacle of couenant, and the arke of testimonie, and the propitiatorie, that is ouer it, and al the vessel of the tabernacle, <sup>8</sup> and the table and the vessel therof, the candlesticke most pure with the vessel therof, and the Altares of incense, <sup>9</sup> and of holocauste, and al their vessel, the lauer with his foote, <sup>10</sup> the holie vestments in the ministerie for Aaron the priest, and for his sonnes, that they may execute their office, about the sacred things: <sup>11</sup> the oile of vnction, and the incense of spices in the Sanctuarie, al thinges which I haue commanded thee, shal they make. <sup>12</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>13</sup> Speake to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: See that you keepe my sabbath: because it is a signe betwen me and you in your generations: that you may know that I am the Lord, which sanctifie you. <sup>14</sup> Keepe you my sabbath: for it is holie vnto you: he that shal pollute it, dying shal die: he that shal doe worke in it, his soule shal perish out of the middes of his people. <sup>15</sup> Six dayes shal you doe worke: in the seuenth day is the sabbath, the holie rest to the Lord. Euerie one that shal doe any worke in this day, shal die. <sup>16</sup> Let the children of Israel keepe the Sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an euerlasting couenant <sup>17</sup> betwen me and the children of Israel, and a signe perpetual. for in six dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, and in the seuenth he cea-sed from worke. <sup>18</sup> And our Lord, when he had ended such speaches in mount Sinai, gaue vnto Moyses two stone tables of testimonie, written with the finger of God.
