Exovil.

Frewil in men proued, by their resisting brethren in selling him thought euil, not moued nor inclined thereto by God, who had no part in their euil thought, but turned it to good. (*Gen. 50.*) by Gods threatening Pharao <sup>8</sup>If thou wilt not dismisse Israel. Which were vnust if Pharao could not doe otherwise. Likewise by that Pharao often changed his mind, sometimes promising to dismisse the Hebrewes, and againe refusing to doe it, which sheweth (saith Theodoret) freewil of the mind: and by Gods preuention of tentations, leading the Israelites not the neerest way, but by the desert, lest perhaps it would repent them; and they would returne into Ã†gypt (*Exod. 13*) Mans consent therfore is free notwith-

standing Gods wil, direction, and commandement. And so his industry is required in his dailie affaires, and then to relie on Gods prouidence, otherwise only to expect Gods wil, operation, or protection, man himself endeuoring nothing is to tempt God. Therfore Abraham (*Gen. 12.*) Isaac (*c. 26.*) Iacob (*ca. 32.*) and the parents of Moyses (*Exo. 2.*) being in feare and distresse vsed al prudence to auoid imminent dangers, albeit they had special reuelations of safetie and happie successe. Neither doth God euer tempt anie man to sinne, but proueth his seruants and maketh them knowen to the world for example of others, and their owne merit. *Gen. 22. Iob. 1. 2. &c*.

Onlie faith doth not iustifie, nor workes without faith, but both together do iustifie, and are meritorious: so Abraham beleued God because he is omnipotent and truth it selfe, and it was reputed to him vnto iustice (*Gen. 15.*) but this faith was not sole, for it had hope, loue, obedience, and other vertues adioyned, and the beleuing was an act of iustice. In like maner Abraham was iustified by workes, offering Isaac his sonne vpon the Altar (*Gen. 22.*) but this worke presupposed faith, that God is able to raise euen from the dead. So by workes faith is con-summate. By hospitalitie Abraham and Lot vnawares receiued Angels to harbour. (*Gen. 18. 19.*) Abraham was perfect according to perfection of this life. (*Gen. 17.*) most highly commended for foure more notorious actes proceding of two special vertues faith and obedience. The first was his prompt obedience, in leauing his countrie and kindred, going he knew not whither, nor how farre, simply and cherfully expecting Gods further direction, when to goe, and where to abide, (*Gen. 12.*) The second was his excellent faith presently beleuing Gods promise (which by al humane reason semed vnpossible) that he should haue innumerable progenie (*Gen. 15.*) The third was, that he did not only most sincerely and religiously serue God, but also taught his posteritie so to do, as God himself testifieth of him, saying: I know that he wil command his children, and his house after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, and do iudgement and iustice, (*Gen. 18.*) The fourth was that most heroical act of obedience, admirable
