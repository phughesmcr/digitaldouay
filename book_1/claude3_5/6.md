To the English Reader.

But here an other question may be proposed: Why we translate the Latin text, rather then the Hebrew, or Greke, which Protestantes preferre, as the fountaine tongues, wherin holie Scriptures were first written? To this we answer, that if in dede those first pure Editions were now extant, or if such as be extant, were more pure then the Latin, we would also preferre such fountaines before the riuers, in whatsoeuer they should be found to disagree. But the ancient best lerned Fathers, & Doctors of the Church, do much complaine, and testifie to vs, that both the Hebrew and Greke Editions are fouly corrupted by Iewes, and Heretikes, since the Latin was truly translated out of them, whiles they were more pure. And that the same Latin hath bene farre better conserued from corruptions. So that the old Vulgate Latin Edition hath bene preferred, and vsed for most authentical aboue a thousand and three hundered yeares. For by this verie terme S. Ierom calleth that Version *the vulgate or common*, which he conferred with the Hebrew of the old Testament, and with the Greke of the New; which he also purged from faultes committed by writers, rather amending then translating it. Though in regard of this amending, S. Gregorie calleth it *the new version of S. Ierom*: who neuertheles in an other place calleth the self same, *the old Latin Edition*, iudging it most worthy to be folowed. S. Augustin calleth it *the Italian*. S. Isidorus witnesseth that *S. Ieroms version was receiued and approued by al Christian Churches*. Sophronius also a most lerned man, seing S. Ieroms Edition so much estemed, not only of the Latines, but also of the Grecians, turned the Psalter & Prophetes, out of the same Latin into Greke. Of latter times what shal we nede to recite other most lerned men? S. Bede S. Anselme, S. Bernard, S. Thomas, S. Bonauenture, & the rest? Who al vniformly allege this only text as authentical. In so much that al other Latin Editions, which S. Ierom saith were in his time almost innumerable, are as it were fallen
