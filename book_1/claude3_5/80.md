<sup>6</sup> Abram beleued God, and it was reputed to him vnto iustice. <sup>7</sup> And he said to him: I am the Lord that brought thee out from Vr of the Chaldees for to giue thee this land, and that thou mightest possesse it. <sup>8</sup> But he said: Lord God, how may I know that I shal possesse it? <sup>9</sup> And our Lord answered, and said: Take me a cowe of three yeares old, and a shee goat of three yeares, and a ramme of three yeares, a turtle also, and a pigeon. <sup>10</sup> Who taking al these, diuided them by the mydes, and laid ech two peeces drowe one against the other: but the birdes he diuided not. <sup>11</sup> And the foules lighted vpon the carcasses, and Abram droue them away. <sup>12</sup> And when the sunne was setting, a deepe sleepe fel vpon Abram, and a great and darkesome horrour inuaded him. <sup>13</sup> And it was said vnto him: Know and fore-know that a pilgrime shal thy seede be in a land not their owne (and they shal bring them vnder bondage, and afflict them) foure hundred yeares. <sup>14</sup> But the nation, whom they shal serue, I wil iudge: and after this they shal goe forth with great substance. <sup>15</sup> And thou shalt goe to thy fathers in peace, buried in a good old age. <sup>16</sup> But in the fourth generation they shal returne hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhcanes are not at the ful vntil this present time. <sup>17</sup> Therfore when the sunne was set, there rose a darke mist, and there appeared a fornace smoking, and a flake of fire passing betwene those diuisions. <sup>18</sup> That day God made a couenant with Abram, saying: To thy seede wil I geue this land from the riuer of Ã†gypt euen to the great riuer Euphrates, <sup>19</sup> the Cineans, & Cenezites, the Cedmonites, <sup>20</sup> and the Hethites, and the Pherezits, the Raphaims also, <sup>21</sup> and the Amorreans & the Cananites, and the Gergasites, and the Iebusites.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XV.

[^1] *Beleued God.*] S. Hilarie (li. 9. de Trin) and S. Ambrose (li. 1. de Abra-ham. c. 3) by this example teach vs, what maner of faith is reputed to iustice. towit, such a faith as without tergiuersation, or requiring of proofe or reason, doth simply beleue that which God once saith, because he is omnipotent, how farsoeuer the thing that is said surmounteth our vnderstanding. For so heroical was the act of Abrahams faith, promptly beleuing Gods word in a matter most hard.

<aside>These three kindes of beastes and two of birdes signi-fie that the Is-raelites should be three gene-rations in a strange land, the fourth in the desert, the fifth in posses-sion of Cha-naan, Theod. q. 65. in Gen.</aside>

<aside>Abraham and his seed were strangers in land 400 and odde yeares, but in seruitu-de and afflicti-on about 140.</aside>

<aside>God defer-reth to punish, either that the wicked may amend, or the good be exer-cised by them. S. Aug. Psal. 54. or because the iniquity is not come to that great measure which his wisdome for-seeth, and wil punish in the end, to his owne more glorie, and more good of others. S. Greg ho. 11. in 3. Ezech.</aside>

<aside>To beleue Gods word without stag-gering is an act of iustice.</aside>
