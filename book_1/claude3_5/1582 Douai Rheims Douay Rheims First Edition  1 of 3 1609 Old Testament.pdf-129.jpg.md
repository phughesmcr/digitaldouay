GENESIS.

<sup>9</sup>wife: and let vs contract mariages one with an other:
<sup>10</sup>geue vs your daughters, and take you our daughters. And
dwel with vs: the land is at your commandement, tille, occupie, and possesse it. <sup>11</sup>Yea and Sichem also said to her
father and to her brethren: Let me finde grace in your sight:
<sup>12</sup>and what soeuer you shal appointe I wil geue: raise the
dowrie, and require giftes, and I shal gladly geue, what you
<sup>13</sup>shal demande: only geue me this wench to wife. <sup>14</sup>Jacobs
sonnes answered Sichem & his father in guile, being wrath
for the deflouring of their sister: We can not doe this
which you demande, nor geue our sister to an vncircumcised
person: which with vs is an vnlawful & abhominable thing.
<sup>15</sup>But in this order we may be confederate, if you wil be
like to vs, and al the man sexe among you be circumcised:
<sup>16</sup>then wil we geue and take mutually your daughters, and
ours: and we wil dwel with you, and wil be one people:
<sup>17</sup>but if you wil not be circumcised, we wil take our daugh-
<sup>18</sup>ter, and depart. <sup>19</sup>The offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem
his sonne: neither did the young man make delay, but
forthwith fulfilled that which was demanded: for he loued
the wench exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in al
<sup>20</sup>his fathers house. <sup>21</sup>And going into the gate of the citie,
they spake to the people: These men are peaceable,
and are willing to dwel with vs: let them occupie in the land,
and til it, which being large and wide doth lacke men to tille
it: their daughters we shal take to wife, and ours we wil
<sup>22</sup>geue to them. One thing there is for the which so great
a good is differred: If we circumcise our men sexe, folowing
<sup>23</sup>the rite of the nation. And their substance, and cattle,
and al things that they possesse, shal be ours: only in this let
vs condescend, and dwelling together, we shal make one
<sup>24</sup>people. <sup>25</sup>And they al assented, and circumcised al the man
sex. And behold the third day, when the griefe of the
woundes is most paineful: Jacobs two sonnes, Simeon and
Leui the brothers of Dina, taking their swordes, entred into
<sup>26</sup>the citie boldly: and killing al the man sex, murdered withal
Hemor and Sichem, taking away Dina their sister out of
<sup>27</sup>Sichems house. <sup>28</sup>When they were gone forth, the other
sonnes of Jacob ranne in vpon them that were slaine: and
spoiled the citie in reuenge of the rape. And wasting al
things that were in their houses, and fildes, their sheepe and
