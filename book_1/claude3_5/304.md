Cleane and
otherwise necessarie, but because he so commanded. As at first he commanded Adam not to eate of the tree of knowledge of good and euel. The transgression wherof brought al mankind into miserie. From which againe Christ by his obedience redemed vs. For obseruation of this law old Eleazarus, and the seuen bretheren with their mother, did geue their liues, rather then they would eate swines flesh, and for the same are glorious Martyrs, as testifie S. Cyprian *epist. 56. ad Thibaritanos. & li. 4. epist. 6. Nazianzen, *orat. 20. de Machab. S. Chrysostom, *de natiuitate septem Machab. S. Ambrose. *li. 1. de offic. c. 41. & li. 2. de Iacob. c. 10. & 11. and the whole Church celebrating their feast 1. the first day of August. Thirdly and most specially these obseruations were commanded for signification of vertues to be embraced, and of vices or sinnes to be auoided. Such beastes therfore were holden for cleane, and allowed for mans foode, as diuide the hoofe, and ruminate, or chew the cudde, signifying discretion betwixt good and euel: and diligent consideration, or meditation of Gods law: and the beastes which lack those two properties of diuiding the hoofe, and chewing the cudde, or either of them, were reputed vncleane, signifying such men as care not whether they do wel or euel, or do not ruminate, and meditate good things, which they heare or read, forgetting or neglecting, what is taught them. Likewise the fishes that haue finnes and scales, which signifie eleuating of the mind, and austeritie of life, were counted cleane: but these that want either of the same were vncleane and prohibited. Also certaine birdes were esteemed cleane and allowed to be eaten: others vncleane and forbid. As the Eagle, signifying pride; the griffon, tyrannie; the osprey, oppression; the kite, fraud; the vulture, sedition; al kindes of rauens, carnal voluptuousnes; the ostrich, worldlie cares; the owle, slouth, or dulnes in spiritual things; the sterne, duble dealing; al kindes of hawkes, crueltie; the schritch owle, luxurie; the diuer, gluttonie; the storke, enuie; the swanne, hypocrisie; the onocratal, auarice; the porphirion, selfe wil; the herodian, a bloudie mind; the caladrian, much babling; the lapwing, desolation of mind, or desperation; the batte, earthlie policie; and the like in other birdes, beastes, and fishes. Al agreable to that time, in which (saith S. Augustin, *li. 6 c. 7. cont. Faust.) those things were to be foreshewd, not only in wordes, but also in factes, which should be reueled in latter time; and being now reueled by Christ, and in Christ, the burdenous obseruances are not imposed to the faithful gentiles, to whom yet the authoritie of the prophecie is commended. To the same effect. *li. cont. Adimant, c. 14. & li 10. haerit. ha. 44. S. Hierom. *in Matt. 15. Origenes, *ho. 7. S. Cyril. *li. 9. in Leuit. S. Gregorie, *in Ezec. 7. Procopius *in Leuit. 11. Out of whom and others S. Thomas explicateth at large, that which we haue here briefly noted. *1. 2. q. 102. a. 6.
