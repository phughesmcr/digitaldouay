and of refuge. NVMERI. 395

round about, shal reach the space of a thousand paces. <sup>5</sup>Toward the East shal be two thousand cubites: and toward the South in like manner shal be two thousand: toward the sea also, which looketh to the West, shal be the same measure: and the North part shal be limited with equal boundes. And the cities shal be in the middes, and the suburbes without. <sup>6</sup>And of the same townes, which you shal geue to the Leuites, six shal be separated for the ayde of fugitiues: that he may flee to them which hath shed bloud: and beside these other fourtie two townes, <sup>7</sup>that is, in al fourtie eight <sup>8</sup>with their suburbes. And those cities, that shal be geuen of the possessions of the children of Israel, from them that haue more, moe shal be taken away: and that haue lesse, fewer. Eache shal geue townes to the Leuites according to the measure of their inheritance. <sup>9</sup>Our Lord said to Moyses: <sup>10</sup>Speake to the children of Israel, & thou shalt say to them: When you shal haue passed ouer Iordan into the Land of Chanaan, <sup>11</sup>determine what cities shal be for the succour of fugitiues, that haue not voluntarily shed bloud: <sup>12</sup>in which when the fugitiue shal be, the kinsman of him that is killed can not kil him, vntil he stand in the sight of the multitude, and his cause be iudged. <sup>13</sup>And of those cities, <sup>14</sup>that are separated for refuge of the fugitiues, <sup>15</sup>three shal be beyond Iordan, and three in the Land of Chanaan, as wel for the children of Israel as for strangers and soiourners, that he may flee to them, which hath not voluntaryly shed bloud. <sup>16</sup>If any man strike with yron, and he die that was strooken, he shal be guiltie of murder, and him self shal die. <sup>17</sup>If he cast a stone, and he that is strooken die: he shal be <sup>18</sup>punished in like manner. If he that is strooken with wood <sup>19</sup>die, he shal be reuenged by the strikers bloud. The kinsman of him that is slaine, shal kil the murderer, as sowne <sup>20</sup>as he apprehendeth him, he shal kil him. If through hatred one push a man, or cast any thing at him by stratageme: <sup>21</sup>or being his enemie, strike him with his hand, and he die: the striker shal be guiltie of murder. the kinsman of him <sup>22</sup>that is slaine as sowne as he findeth him, shal kil him. But <sup>23</sup>if by chance medlie, and without hatred, <sup>24</sup>and enmitie, he do any of these thinges, and this be proued in the hearing of the people, and the question debated betwen him that <sup>25</sup>stroke, & the next of bloud: the innocent shal be deliuered
