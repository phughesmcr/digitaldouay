from the hand of the reuenger, & by sentence shal be brought
backe into the citie, to which he had fled, and he shal tarie
there, <sup>16</sup> vntil the High priest, that is anointed with the holie
oile, do die. <sup>17</sup> If the murderer be found without the limites
of the cities, that are deputed to the banished, <sup>18</sup> and be stroo-
ken of him that is the reuenger of bloud: he shal be guiltles
that killed him. <sup>19</sup> For the fugitiue ought to haue stayed in
the citie vntil the death of the High priest. And after he is
dead, then shal the murderer returne into his countrie.
<sup>20</sup> These thinges shal be perpetual, and for an ordinance in al
your habitations. <sup>21</sup> The murderer shal be punished by wit-
nesses: none shal be condemned, at the testimonie of one man.
<sup>22</sup> You shal not take a price of him, that is guiltie of bloud,
he also shal die forthwith. <sup>23</sup> The banished and fugitiues
before the death of the High priest may by no meanes re-
turne into their owne cities. <sup>24</sup> Pollute not the land of your
habitation, which is polluted with the bloud of innocentes:
neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his bloud, that
sheddeth an other mans bloud. <sup>25</sup> And so shal your possession
be cleansed my self abyding with you. For I am the Lord that
dwel among the children of Israel.

CHAP. XXXVI.

*That the inheritances may not be alienated from one tribe to an other, al must
marrie within their owne tribes.*

AND the princes also of the families of Galaad, the sonne
of Machir, the sonne of Manasses of the stocke of the
children of Ioseph came: and spake to Moyses before the
princes of Israel, and said: <sup>2</sup> Our Lord hath commanded
thee our lord that thou shouldest by lotte diuide the Land to
the children of Israel, and that to the daughters of Salphaad
our brother thou shouldest geue the possession dew to their
father: <sup>3</sup> whom if men of an other tribe take to wiues, their
possession shal folow, and being translated to an other tribe,
it shal be a diminishing of our inheritance. <sup>4</sup> And so it shal
come to passe, that when the Iubilee, that is the fiftith yeare
of remission is come, the "distribution of the lottes shal be
confounded, and the possession of one shal passe to others.
<sup>5</sup> Moyses answered the children of Israel, and as our Lord
commanded, said: The tribe of the children of Ioseph hath
spoken rightly. <sup>6</sup> And this law is promulgated of our Lord

[^1]: Mystically this signified, that the way to true life was not open before Christes death. *S. Greg. ho. 6. in Ezechiel.*
