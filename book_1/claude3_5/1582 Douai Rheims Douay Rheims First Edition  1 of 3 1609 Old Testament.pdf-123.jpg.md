Laban called The witnesse heape : and Iacob called The hillock of testimonie, either of them according to the proprietie of his language. <sup>48</sup>And Laban said : This heape shal be a witnes betwen me and thee this day, and therfore the name therof was called Galaad, that is, The witnes heape. <sup>49</sup>Our Lord behold and iudge betwen vs when we shal be <sup>50</sup>departed one from the other, <sup>51</sup>if thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wiues ouer them : none is witnes of our talke but God, who is present and beholdeth. <sup>52</sup>And he said againe to Iacob : Behold this heape, and the stone which I haue erected betwen me and thee, shal be a witnes : this heape, I say, and the stone be they for a testimonie, if either I shal passe beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt passe beyond it, thinking harme <sup>53</sup>to me. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor iudge betwen vs, the God of their father. Iacob therfore <sup>54</sup>sware by the feare of his father Isaac : <sup>55</sup>and after he had offered victimes in the mountaine, he called his brethren to eate bread. Who when they had eaten, lodged there : but Laban arising in the night, kissed his sonnes, and daughters, and blessed them : and returned vnto his place.

Againe. Osee the Prophet foretelling the lamentable state of the Israelites, sayeth, they shal be long without King, prince, sacrifice, altar, ephod, and teraphim, which last word in the Protestants English Bibles remained vntranslated Where if they had translated images (as here they doe) it would proue, that some images pertaine to true religion, the want wherof is lamented among other principal things.</aside>

And in this, saith Theodoret, she was a right figure of the Catholique Church, which depriueth idolaters of their idols. It is probable also by her hiding of them, that she held them not for goddes, when she put them vnder the camels litter, and sate vpon them. Finally that she reserued them, and did not cast them away, nor burne,
