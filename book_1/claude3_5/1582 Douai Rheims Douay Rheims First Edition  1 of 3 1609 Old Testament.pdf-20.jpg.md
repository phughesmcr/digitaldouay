And it may be divided into eight partes: The first contayneth the Creation of heaven and Earth, and of other Creatures, and lastly of Man.chap. 1. & 2.

2. The second part is of the transgression & fal of man, & his casting out of Paradise, of multiplication of men, and of sinne, though stil some were iust, of the general floud, that drowned al except eight persons, & few other living creatures of the earth. from the third chap. to the 8. The third part is of the new increase, & multiplication of the same, from the 8. chap. to the 11. The fourth, of the confusion of tongues, & the division of nations. in the 11. chap. The fift relateth Abrahams going forth of his countrie, Gods promise, that in his seede al Nations should be blessed, & the commandment of Circumcision, from the 12. chap. to the 21. The sixth part recounteth the progenie, and other histories, specially the great vertues of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, from the 21. chap. to the 37.

# The signification of the markes here used, for direction of the reader.

The numbers in the argumentes of chapters point to the verse, where the matter mentioned beginneth.

This forme of crosse [†] in the text, sheweth the beginning of everie verse.

The numbers in the margent against the crosses, shew the number of verses in the same chapter.

This marke " signifieth that there foloweth an Annotation after the chapter, upon the word, or wordes, wherto it is adioyned. The number also of the same verse is prefixed to the Annotation.

These foure prickes :: shew that there is an Annotation in the margent, upon that place. And when manie occurre, the first answereth to the first marke, the second to the second, and so forth. In like maner the citations of places in the inner margent, are applied to the wordes alleged.

But when there be more such marginal annotations, then may easely be applied, we use the letters of the Alphabete for direction.

This forme of a starre [*] in the text or annotations, pointeth to the explication of some word or wordes, in the margent.

Sometimes we put the Concordance of other Scriptures in the inner margent of the text.

We have also noted in the margent, when the Bookes of holie Scripture (or partes thereof) are read in the Church Service. For their sakes, that desire to read the same, in order of the Ecclesiastical Office.
