meete him. <sup>29</sup>Whither when he was come, Ioseph addressing his chariot went vp to mete his father, vnto the same place: and seing him fel vpon his neck, and as they embraced he wept. <sup>30</sup>And his father said to Ioseph: Now wil I die with ioy, because I haue seene thy face, and do leaue thee aliue. <sup>31</sup>But he spake to his brethren, and to al his fathers house: I wil goe vp, and wil tel Pharao, and wil say to him: My brethren, and my fathers house, that were in the Land of Chanaan, are come to me: <sup>32</sup>and the men are pastours of sheepe, and their trade is to feede flockes: their cattel, and heardes, and al that they could haue, they haue brought with them. <sup>33</sup>And when he shal cal you, <sup>34</sup>and shal say: What is your trade? <sup>35</sup>You shal answer: We thy seruantes are pastours, from our infancie vntil this present, both we and our fathers. And this you shal say, that you may dwel in the Land of Gessen, because the Ægyptians detest al pastours of sheepe.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XLVI.

[^1]1. *Come to the wel of oath*] In this holie place (called *Bersabee*, that is, *wel of oath*) where Abraham and Isaac had confirmed by oath, their league with the Kings of the countrie, and erected Altares, Iacob also consulted God, about his going into Ægypt, and was commanded to goe with al that he had.

[^2]2. *Sixtie six. 27. seuentie*] The difficultie in these two verses, concerning the number of Israelites, that went at first into Ægypt with Iacob, is easily explicated, that iust sixtie six, of his owne issue, came in with him; and himself being counted (as he must be, for he went thither before) and his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim (borne there) they were in al seuentie. But a far greater difficultie remaineth: for besides these seuentie persons, the Septuagint Greeke Interpreters number and name fiue more: to wit, a sonne and a nephew of Manasses (the first called *Machir*, the other *Galaad*,) and two sonnes of Ephraim (called *Sutalaam*, and *Taam*,) and one nephew (named *Edom*) which number of seuentie fiue, S. Steuen also citeth, following the vulgar knowen Scripture of the Septuagint, rather then the Hebrew text. Now in what sense, these fiue could be said to haue entred into Ægypt with Iacob, being not then borne, may seme strange, some of them not borne during Iacobs life, for Iacob liued but seuentene yeares in Ægypt (chap 47. v. 28.) and Ioseph being maried but nine yeares before (for this was the second deare yeare, after the seuen plentiful yeares) his sonnes could not exceed eight or nine yeares old, at his death, could not then be grandfathers: how therfore these fiue named by the Septuagint, and some others, not then borne, of the lines
