fallen out of al Diuines handes, and growne out of credite and vse. If moreouer we consider S. Ieroms lerning, pietie, diligence, and sinceritie, together with the commodities he had of best copies, in al languages then extant, and of other lerned men, with whom he conferred: and if we so compare the same with the best meanes that hath bene since, surely no man of indifferent iudgement, wil match anie other Edition with S.
