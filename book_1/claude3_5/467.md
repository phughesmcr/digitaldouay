<sup>5</sup>When brethren shall dwell together, and one of them die without children, the wife of the deceased shall not marie to another: but his brother shall take her, and rayse vp the seede of his brother: <sup>6</sup>and the first borne sonne of her he shal cal by his name, that his name be not abolished out of Israel. <sup>7</sup>But if he wil not take his brothers wife, that by law is dew to him, the woman shal goe to the gate of the citie, and cal vpon the ancientes, and say: My husbandes brother wil not rayse vp his brothers seede in Israel: nor take me to his wife. <sup>8</sup>And forthwith they shal cause him to be sent for, and shal aske him. If he answer: I wil not take her to wife: <sup>9</sup>the woman shal come to him before the ancientes, and shal take of his shoe from his foote, and spitte in his face, and say: So shal it be done to the man, that buildeth not his brothers house. <sup>10</sup>And his name shal be called in Israel: The house of the vnshodde. <sup>11</sup>If two men fal at wordes betwixt them selues, and one beginne to brawle against the other, and the wife of the one willing to deliuer her husband out of the hand of the stronger, put forth her hand, and take his priuities: <sup>12</sup>thou shalt cutte of her hand, neither shalt thou be moued with any pitie vpon her. <sup>13</sup>Thou shalt not haue diuerse weightes in thy bagge, a greater and a lesser. <sup>14</sup>neither shal there be in thy house a greater bushel and a lesse. <sup>15</sup>Thou shalt haue a weight iust and true, and thy bushel shal be equal and true: that thou mayest liue a long time vpon the Land, which our Lord thy God shal geue thee. <sup>16</sup>For thy Lord abhorreth him, that doth these thinges, and detesteth al iniustice. <sup>17</sup>Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou camest out of Ægypt: <sup>18</sup>how he mette thee: & stroke the hindemost of thy armie, which being wearie rested them selues, when thou wast spent with famine and labour, and he feared not God. <sup>19</sup>Therfore when our Lord thy God shal geue thee rest, and subdewe al nations round about in the Land, which he hath promised thee: thou shalt destroy his name vnder heauen. Beware thou forget it not.
