And when he had heard the causes of his iourney, <sup>14</sup> he answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the dayes of one moneth were expired, <sup>15</sup> he said to him: because thou art my brother, shalt thou serue me gratis? Tel me what wages wilt thou take. <sup>16</sup> He had in dede two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia: and the younger was called Rachel. <sup>17</sup> But Lia was bleare eyed: Rachel wel fauored, and of a bewtiful countenance. <sup>18</sup> Whom Iacob louing, said: I wil serue thee for Rachel thy younger daughter, seauen yeares. <sup>19</sup> Laban answered: It is better that I geue her to thee then to an other man, tary with me. <sup>20</sup> Iacob therfore serued for Rachel seuen yeares: and they semed a few dayes because of the greatnes of his loue. <sup>21</sup> And he said to Laban: geue me my wife: because now the time is complete, that I may companie with her. <sup>22</sup> Who hauing bid a great number of his freinds to the feast, made the mariage. <sup>23</sup> And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him, <sup>24</sup> geuing his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha. With whom when Iacob had companied after the maner, when morning was come he saw Lia: <sup>25</sup> and he said to his father in lawe: What is it that thou didest meane to doe? did not I serue thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceiued me? <sup>26</sup> Laban answered: It is not the custome in this place, that we bestowe the younger in mariage first. <sup>27</sup> Make vp the weeke of dayes of this
