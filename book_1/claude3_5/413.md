The limites of Chanaan. NVMERI. 393

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXXIII.

<aside>Two handes which worke saluation.</aside>

Moyses and Aaron.] Moyses by whom the Law was geuen, and Aaron in whom Priesthood was established, signified good workes, and the right worship of God. Of which (saieth S. Hierom) each one needeth the other. For neither doth it profite thee to exercise vertues vnles thou knowest thy Creator: nor the worshiping of God auaileth thee to saluation, vnles thou fulfil the precepts of thy Maker. By these two handes, as with two Seraphims we breake out into confession of the holie Trinitie, saying: Holie, holie, holie Lord God of hoastes. Epist. ad Fabiol. de 42. Mans.

These shal be the borders <sup>10</sup> in the North part. † From thence they shal marke out the boundes toward the East side from the village Enan vnto <sup>11</sup> Sephama, † and from Sephama the boundes shal goe downe vnto Rebla against the fountaine Daphnim: from thence <sup>12</sup> they shal come eastward to the sea Cenereth, † and shal reach
