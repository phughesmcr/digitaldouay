CHAP. XXXII.

<aside>Iacobs feare was iust, and without fault.</aside>

7. *Feared excedingly*] Iustly may we meruel, why Iacob so often assured by Gods promises, confirmed by his manie blessings, protected in al former dangers, accompanied the night before with armies of Angels, indued also with al vertues, and namely with perfect charitie (which expelleth feare) was for al this so vehemently afraid! S. Augustin answereth, that he neither distrusted in God, nor did anie vnlawful thing: but did his owne endeuour wisely and confidently, lest by presuming or desparing he should rather haue tempted God, then trusted in him. The causes of his feare were in respect of him selfe and his brother. For considering Gods former promises, benefites & protections were not to be presumed as absolute signes of his perpetual loue but conditional, if him selfe perseured sincerly in Gods seruice. And seing *the iust man knoweth not whether he be worthie of loue, or of hatred*, he might doubt, lest by his twentie yeares conuersation among Infidels in Mesopotamia, he had contracted some sinnes, for which God might suffer him to fall into calamitie and affliction. And though he was in dede stil more and more vertuous, and consequently in Gods more fauour and protection: yea so much the more, by how much lesse he presumed of his owne good state and merites: yet by the vehement apprehending of his brothers inclination to re-

uenge, the greatnes of the occasion by procuring the first-birth-right, and his fathers blessing from him, the newes of his speedie coming towards him with foure hundred men, the natural situation of the place, where Esau might easely inuiron him, and (as he humbly thought) his owne vnworthines, he was possessed with natural feare (such as happeneth to constant men) and was sore afflicted for the tender care of his familie. But reflecting vpon Gods goodnes, he prudently disposed of his people and flockes, and besought God to protect him and his, by prayer qualified with requisite conditions, to wit, with humilitie, not asking for his owne but *for Abraham and Isaac* sake, and for Gods owne promise, acknowledging himselfe to *be lesse then Gods mercies* to-

wards him, with gratitude recounting great benefites receiued, saying, *With my staffe I passed ouer this Iordan, and now with two troupes I do returne*, with confidence in that God had said, he *would dilate his sede as the sand of the sea*, and with meeknes *in sending giftes and good wordes* to Esau. Thus finally he pa-cified him, and so his owne feare was turned into ioy.

<aside>Iacob wrestled with an Angel corporally, & spiritually.</aside>

24. *A man wrestled*] This wrestling with an Angel assuming a bodie in forme of a man was corporal, as the effect shewed in Iacobs sinow shrunck vp, which made him to halt. v. 25. & 31. It was also spiritual, as appeareth by his earnest prayer, vrging and at last obtayning the Angels blessing. S. Dionys. c. 4. cel. Hierar. S. Greg. prefat. in Iob. Theodorer, q. 91. in Gen.
