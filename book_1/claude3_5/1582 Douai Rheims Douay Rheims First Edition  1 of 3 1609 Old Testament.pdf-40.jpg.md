and the whole Church beleeueth) was preferued from that death, and so vndoubtedly were Seth, and Enos being most holie. and the rest here recounted, as is most probable.[^1] Neuertheles for further confutation of the contrarie opinion of Protestants, the reader may also obserue the iudgement of S. Chrisostom, who affirmeth that *Though it be not a matter of faith, whether Enoch be now in Paradise (from whence Adam and Eue were expelled) or in some other place, yet that he is translated aliue: Diuine tamen Scripture (saith he) quod nondum ipsius experimus, the holie Scripture saith that God translated him, and that he is not dead*. And S. Augustin as expressly saith: *Non mortuus, sed viuus translatus est. He (to wit Enoch) is translated, not dead but aliue*. Yea he teacheth how his life is sustained thus many thousand yeares vpon earth. And likewise more certaine that both Enoch and Elias shal dye. *For seing Enoch and Elias* (saith he) *are dead in Adam, and carying the offspring of death in their flesh, to pay that debt, are to returne to this life (by common resurrection) and so pay that debt which being so deferred, is not remitted*.

[^2] Diuers reasons are also alleaged, why God would reserue these two aliue: First to shew by example, that as their mortal bodies are long conserued from corruption or decaying, in like sort Adam and Eue and al others not sinning, should haue bene conserued, and according to Gods promise, neuer haue died, but after some good time translated to heauen, and indued with immortalitie. Secondly to giue vs an argument of immortalitie, which is promised after the general Resurrection. For seing God doth preserue some mortal, so long from al infirmitie, we may assuredly beleue that he wil geue immortal & eternal life of bodie and soule to his Sainctes, after they haue payed the debt of death, and are risen againe. Thirdly these two (one of the law of nature, the other of the law of Moyses) are preserued aliue, to come among men againe towards the end of the world, to teach, testifie, and defend the true faith and doctrine of Christ against Antichrist, when he shal most violently oppugne & persecute the Church. Of Enoch it is said in the booke of Ecclesiasticus, that he was translated, *vt det gentibus p≈ìnitentiam*, that he geue repentance to the nations, by his preaching, & reducing the deceaued from Antichrist. And of Elias Malachie prophesieth, that he *shal come before the great and terrible day of our Lord, and shal turne the hart of the fathers* (that is the people of the Iewes) *to the sonnes* (the Christians) *and of the sonnes* (the deceaued Christians) *to the fathers*, the ancient true Catholiques.
