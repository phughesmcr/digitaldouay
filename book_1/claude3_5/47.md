vpon the earth according to their kind, and al foule accor-
ding to their kind, al birds, and al that fly <sup>15</sup> went to Noe
into the arke, two and two of al flesh, wherin there was
breath of life. <sup>16</sup> And such as entred in, male and female of
al flesh did enter in, as God had commanded him: and our
Lord <sup>17</sup> shut him in on the out side. <sup>17</sup> And the floud grew
fourtie daies vpon the earth: and the waters increased, and
lifted vp the arke on high from the earth. <sup>18</sup> For they ouer-
flowed exceedingly: and filled al on the face of the earth:

<aside>God vseth both natural and superna-

pleaseth his goodnes to impert to them power and vertue.

[^2]: *but only Noe*] As there is not anie thing in al the old Testament, from

rable, or of greater importance, then this historie of the general floud; so were
