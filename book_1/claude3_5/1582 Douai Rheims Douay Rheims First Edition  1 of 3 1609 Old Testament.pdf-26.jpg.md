CHAP. II.

*The worke of six dayes being finished, God rested the seuenth day & blessed it. 8. He planteth man in paradise 9. planted with fruitful & faire trees, 17. commandeth him not to eate of the tree of knowledge of good & euil. 18. & formed a woman of a ribbe of Adam.*

THE heauens therefore & the earth were fully finished, <sup>1</sup> and al the furniture of them. † And the seuenth day <sup>2</sup> God ended his worke which he had made: & he rested the seuenth day, from al worke that he had done. † And he <sup>3</sup> blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it: because in it he had ceased from al his worke which God created to make.

† And our Lord God had planted a Paradise of pleasure <sup>8</sup> from the beginning: wherin he placed man whom he had formed. † And our Lord God brought forth of the ground <sup>9</sup> al maner of trees, fayre to behold: and pleasant to eate of: the tree of life also in the middle of Paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good & euil. † And a riuer issued out of the <sup>10</sup> place of pleasure to water Paradise, which from thence is diuided into four heades. † The name of the one is Phison: <sup>11</sup> that is it which compasseth al the land of Heuilath, where gold groweth. † And the gold of that land is very good: <sup>12</sup> there
