AND Nadab, and Abiu the sonnes of Aaron catching censors, did put in fire, and incense therupon, offering before our Lord strange fire: which was not commanded them. <sup>2</sup> And fire comming forth from our Lord, deuoured them, and they dyed before our Lord. <sup>3</sup> And Moyses said to Aaron: This is it which our Lord hath spoken: I wil be sanctified in them, that approch to me, and in the sight of al the people I wil be glorified. Which Aaron hearing held his peace. <sup>4</sup> And Moyses calling Misael, and Elisaphan the sonnes of Oziel, the vncle of Aaron, said to them: Goe and take away your bretheren from the sight of the Sanctuarie, and carie them without the campe. <sup>5</sup> And going forthwith they tooke them as they lay, reuested with linnen tunikes, & did cast them forth, as it had bene commanded them. <sup>6</sup> And Moyses spake to Aaron, & to Eleazar, and Ithamar his sonnes: Vncouer not your heades, and rent not your vestiments, lest perhaps you die, and indignation come vpon al the assemblie.
