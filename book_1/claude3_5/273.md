<sup>21</sup> The length of one borde was ten cubites: and the bredth contained one cubite and an halfe. <sup>22</sup> There were two morteses throughout euerie borde, that one might be ioyned to the other. So made he in al the bordes of the tabernacle. <sup>23</sup> Of the which twentie were at the south side against the South, <sup>24</sup> with fourtie feete of siluer. Two feete were put vnder one borde on either side of the corners, where the morteses of the sides end in the corners. <sup>25</sup> At that side also of the tabernacle, that looked toward the North, he made twentie bordes, <sup>26</sup> with fourty feete of siluer, two feete for euery borde. <sup>27</sup> But against the west, to witte, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six bordes, <sup>28</sup> and two other at ech' corner of the tabernacle behind: <sup>29</sup> which were also ioyned from beneth vnto the toppe, & they grew together into one connexion. So he made on either side at the corners <sup>30</sup> that there were in al eight bordes, and had sixteene feete of siluer, to witte, two feete vnder euerie borde. <sup>31</sup> He made also barres of the wood setim, fiue to hold together the bordes of one side of the tabernacle, <sup>32</sup> and fiue other to ioyne together the bordes of the other side: and besides these, fiue other barres at the west side of the tabernacle against the sea. <sup>33</sup> He made also an other barre, that might come by the middes of the bordes from corner vnto corner. <sup>34</sup> And the borde worke it selfe he plated with gold. And their ringes he made of gold, through which the barres might be drawen: the which also themselues he couered with plates of gold. <sup>35</sup> He made also a veile of hiacinth, and purple, scarlette, and twisted silke, with embrodered worke, varied and distinguished: <sup>36</sup> and foure pillers of the wood setim, which with their heades he plated with gold, casting their feete of siluer. <sup>37</sup> He made also a hanging in the entrie of the tabernacle of hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and twisted silke, with the worke of an embroderer: <sup>38</sup> and fiue pillers with their heades, which he couered with gold, and their feete he did cast of brasse.
