<sup>29</sup> Whither when he was come, Joseph addressing his chariot went up to meet his father, unto the same place: and seeing him fel upon his neck, and as they embraced he wept. <sup>30</sup> And his father said to Joseph: Now wil I die with joy, because I have seene thy face, and do leave thee alive. <sup>31</sup> But he spake to his brethren, and to al his fathers house: I wil goe up, and wil tel Pharao, and wil say to him: My brethren, and my fathers house, that were in the land of Chanaan, are come to me: <sup>32</sup> and the men are pastours of sheepe, and their trade is to feede flockes: their cattel, and heardes, and al that they could have, they have brought with them. <sup>33</sup> And when he shal cal you, and shal say: What is your trade? <sup>34</sup> You shal answer: We thy servantes are pastours, from our infancie until this present, both we and our fathers. And this you shal say, that you may dwel in the Land of Gessen, because the Ægyptians detest al pastours of sheepe.

ANNOTATIONS:
CHAP. XLVI.

[^1] *Came to the wel of oath.*] In this holie place (called Bersabee, that is, wel of oath, where Abraham and Isaac had confirmed by oath, their league with the Kings of the countrie, and erected Altares) Jacob also consulted God, about his going into Ægypt, and was commanded to goe with al that he had.

[^2] *Sixtie six. 27. seventie.*] The difficultie in these two verses, concerning the number of Israelites, that were at first in Ægypt with Jacob, is easily explicated, that just sixtie six, of his owne issue came in with him: and himselfe being counted maketh sixtie seven, adding also Joseph (who was there before) and his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim (borne there) they were in al seventie. But a far greater difficultie remaineth: for besides these seventie persons, the Septuagint Greeke Interpreters number and name five more; to wit, a sonne and a nephew of Manasses (the first called Machir, the other Galaad,) and two sonnes of Ephraim (called Sutalaam, and Taam,) and one nephew (named Edom) which number of seventie five. S. Steven also citeth, following the vulgar knowen Scripture of the Septuagint, rather then the Hebrew text. Now in what sense, these five could be said to have entred into Ægypt with Jacob, being not then borne; may some of them not borne during Jacobs life, for Jacob lived but seventene yeares in Ægypt. (chap 47. v. 28) and Joseph being maried but nine yeares before (for this was the second deare yeare, after the seven plentiful yeares) his sonnes could not exceede seven or eight yeares, when Jacob came to Ægypt; and so being but 14. or 15. yeares old at his death, could not then be grandfathers: how therefore these five named by the Septuagint, and some others, not then borne, of the
