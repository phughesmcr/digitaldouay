ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. VI.

<aside>My name Adonai] Here and in manie other places of holie Scripture in the Hebrew text, is that name of God of foure letters, which the Iewes say is ineffable. Yet sure it is, that Moyses heard it pronounced, and afterwards wrote it as he did the rest in Hebrew letters (which are al consonants) without vowels. But the Rabbins that long after put points or vowels to al other wordes, put none to this. For al then reade Adonai in place therof. And so the Latin, and al vulgar Catholique versions, keepe the same word vntranslated. The Septuagint in Greeke translate KYRIOS, which in Latin is Dominus, in English Lord. So also al ancient Fathers, and (which is most of al) our Sauiour, and his Apostles, alleaging sentences of the old Testament, where this name is contained, stil expresse it by wordes that signifie Lord. Only certaine late writers haue framed a new word, by putting the points of Adonai, to the proper letters of this vnknowen name, which are Iod, He, Vau, He, and so found it Iehouah: which was scarce heard of before an hundred yeares. As Bishop Genebrard, Cardinal Bellarmin, and F. Pererius proue, for that neither ancient Fathers, nor the elder Rabbins, nor later Theologians, nor the most learned Hebricians, as Rabbi Moyses, Aben Ezram, Lyra, Paulus Burgensis and others, found mention Iehouah, as the Name or title of God.</aside>
