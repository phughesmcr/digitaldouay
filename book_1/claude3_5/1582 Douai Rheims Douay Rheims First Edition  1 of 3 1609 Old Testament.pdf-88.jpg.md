Gomorre is multiplied, and their sinne is aggravated exceedingly. <sup>21</sup>I wil descend, and see whether they haue in acte accomplished the crye that is come to me: or whether it be not so, that I may know. <sup>22</sup>And they turned them selues from thence, and went their way to Sodome: but Abraham as yet stood before our Lord. <sup>23</sup>And approching he said: What if there be fiftie iust persons in the citie, shal they perish withal? <sup>24</sup>and wilt thou spare that place for fiftie iust, if they be therin?

<aside>What a zeal hath wilt thou destroy the iust with the wicked? If there are iust men to (halbe fiftie iust persons in the citie, shal they perish withal? their countrie? their faith sa- ueth vs, their iustice defen- deth vs from destruction. S. Amb. li. 1. de Abraham. c.6.</aside>

<sup>25</sup>Be it farre from thee, that thou doe this thing, and that thou kil the iust with the wicked, and that the iust be in like case as the wicked, this is not beseeming thee: which iudgest al the earth, no thou wilt not do this iudgement. <sup>26</sup>And our Lord said to him: If I shal find in Sodome fiftie iust persons within the citie, I wil spare the whole place for their sake. <sup>27</sup>And Abraham answered, and said: Because I haue once begunne, I wil speake to my Lord, wheras I am dust and ashes. <sup>28</sup>What if there shal be fiue lesse then fiftie iust persons? wilt thou for fortie fiue destroy the whole citie? And he said: I wil not destroy it, if I shal finde fiue and fourtie. <sup>29</sup>And againe he said vnto him: But if fourtie shalbe found there, what wilt thou doe? He said: I wil not strike it for fourties sake. <sup>30</sup>Lord, saith he, be not angrie I beseech thee, if I speake: what if thirtie shal be founde there? He answered: I wil not doe it, if I shal find thirtie there. <sup>31</sup>Because, saith he, I haue once begunne, I wil speake to my Lord: What if twentie shalbe founde there? He said: I wil not destroy it for twenties sake. <sup>32</sup>I beseech thee, saith he, be not angrie Lord, if I speake yet once more: what if tenne shalbe found there? And he said: I wil not destroy it for tennes sake. <sup>33</sup>And our Lord departed after that he ceased to speake vnto Abraham: and Abraham returned into his place.
