<sup>5</sup> Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquitie warring. <sup>6</sup> Into their counsel come not my soule, and in their congregation be not my glorie: because in their furie they slew a man, and in their wilfulnes they vndermined a wall. <sup>7</sup> Cursed be their furie, because it is stubborne: and their indignation, because it is hard: I wil divide them in Iacob, and wil disperse them in Israel.

<sup>8</sup> Iudas, thee thy brethren shal praise: thy hand shalbe in the neck of thyne enemies: thy fathers children shal adore thee. <sup>9</sup> A lions whelp Iudas: to the pray my sonne thou didst ascend: taking thy rest thou didst lye as a lion, and as it were a lyonesse, who shal raise him vp? <sup>10</sup> The scepter shal not BE TAKEN away from Iudas, and a duke out of his thigh, til he doe come that is to be sent, and the same shal be the expectation of the gentiles. <sup>11</sup> Tying to the vineyard his colt, and to the vine, o my sonne, his she asse. He shal wash his stole in wine, and in the bloud of the grape his cloke. <sup>12</sup> His eyes are more beautiful then wine, and his teeth whiter then milke.

<sup>13</sup> Zabulon shal dwel in the shore of the sea, and in the road of shippes reaching as farre as Sidon.

<sup>19</sup> Gad, the gyrded shal fight before him: and himself shal be gyrded backward.

<sup>20</sup> Aser, his bread is fat, and he shal geue daynties to kinges.

<sup>21</sup> Nepthali, a hart let forth, & geuing speaches of beautie.

<sup>22</sup> Ioseph a child encreasing, encreasing and comelie to behold: the daughters coursed to and fro vpon the wall. <sup>23</sup> But the dart men did exasperate him, & brawled, and enuied him. <sup>24</sup> His bowe sate vpon the strong, & the bands of his armes and his handes were dissolued, by the handes of the mightie of Iacob: thence came forth a pastour, the stone of Israel. <sup>25</sup> The God of thy father shal be thy helper, &

In some the Patriarch recounteth things past in his life, foretelling the effects therof to come. Other things he forsheweth pertayning to the duuision of the Land of Chanaan, others to the times of the Iudges, of the kings, of the Captiuitie, of Deliuerie from thence, of Christ, of Antichrist, and of the end of this world. Of al which diuers ancient fathers haue written large comentaries, & godlie treatises.</aside>
