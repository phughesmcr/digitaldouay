[^1] Not that they did eate or drinke to much, or fel into ex-cesse, but competently. As the earth is said to be inebriated with raine (Psal. 64.) being sufficiently watered, and so made fruitful, not drowned, nor ouer-flowed, for so it is vnfruitful. S. Hierom. Tradit. Heb. S. Aug. q. 144. super Gen.

CHAP. XLIIII.

*Ioseph causeth their sackes to be filled with corne, and their money to be put againe therin, and in Beniamins sack also a siluer cuppe, 4. and when they were parted, sending after them, chargeth them with theft. 12. And the cuppe being found in Beniamins sack, they al much afflicted returne to Ioseph. 17. Who threatning to kepe Beniamin, 18. Iudas intreateth, 32. and finally offereth him selfe to seruitude for him.*

AND Ioseph commanded the steward of his house, <sup>1</sup>saing: Fil their sackes with corne, as much as they can hold: and put the money of euerie one in the top of his sack. <sup>2</sup>And in the sackes mouth of the younger put my siluer cup, and the price which he gaue for the wheat. And it was so done. <sup>3</sup>And when the morning rose, they were dismist with their asses. <sup>4</sup>And they were now departed out of the citie, and had gone forward a litle way: then Ioseph sending for the steward of his house, said: Arise, quoth he, and pursew the men: and ouertaking them say to them: Why haue you rendred euil for good? <sup>5</sup>The cup which you haue stollen, is that wherin my lord doth drinke, and wherin he is wout to diuine: you haue done a verie euil thing. <sup>6</sup>He did as he had commanded. And hauing ouertaken them, he spake to them in the same order. <sup>7</sup>Who answered: Why doth our lord speake so, as though thy seruantes had committed so haynous a fact? <sup>8</sup>The money, that we found in the top of our sackes, we recaried to thee from the land of Chanaan: and how foloweth it, that we haue stollen out of thy lordes house, gold or siluer? <sup>9</sup>With whom soeuer of thy seruantes that shal be found, which thou seekest, let him die,

<aside>:: By this Ioseph tried his bretherens affection, whether they would intrete for Beniamin, or suffer him to be captiue: as they had be fore sold him selfe to captiuitie. Theod. q. 105. in Gen.</aside>
