Besides these heresies the same S. Hierom relateth two probable opinions. The Iewes Rabbins generally hold that Melchisedech was Sem the sonne of Noe, from whom Abraham and al the Hebrewes descended. VVhich they seme rather to affirme, as loath to confesse that anie man, of other nation then their owne, should haue bene greater and more excellent then Abraham in spiritual causes, then for anie reason they do, or can alleage. Yet manie others specially latter writers as Liranus, Tostatus, Genebrardus and others do embrace this opinion as most probable. Though S. Hierom semeth only to haue added the Hebrewes opinion (as he saith) because he would intimate al to his freind, when he had first cited grauer authores. S.S. Ireneus, Hypolitus, Eusebius Cesariensis, Eusebius Emissenus, Apolinarius, and Eustachius al agreably affirming that Melchisedech was a Chananite, king of Salem, which was after wards called Ierusalem. To this opinion agreeth Philo Iudæus continually speaking of him, as of a stranger to the Iewes nation. Iosephus also a Iew writeth plainly (*li. 7. de bello Iudaico. c. 18.*) that he was of Chanaan, and Prince of the Chananites. Also S. Dionysius Areopagita, (*Cælest. Hier. c. 9.*) S. Epiphanius (*her. 55. & 67.*) Theodoretus (*q. 63. in Gen.*) and Suidas, are of the same mind, and manie other christian Doctors. VVho confirme their assertion by that S. Paul saith to the Hebrewes: <sup>3</sup>*He whose generation is not numbred among them, took tithes of Abraham*. For what els can S. Paul meane, but that Melchisedecks kinred and people, was diuers from the kinred, and people of the Iewes? which he could not say of Sem, from whom Abraham & al Iewes descended: as it can not be said, that Adam and Noe are of diuers generation from anie people that now liueth, because we al come of them. Of this difficultie (not pertaining to anie controuersie of our time) the studious may see more in F. Pererius his commentaries vpon this 14. chap. of Genesis. disp. 1.

[^1] Being the Royal Prophet Dauid, and S. Paul say Christ is a Priest for euer according to the order of Melchisedech, we demand of Protestants, if Christ fulfilled not Melchisedecks figuratiue Sacrifice offered in bread and wine, by offering his owne bodie and bloud at his last supper in formes of bread & wine, and by instituting the same to be offered by his Priests til the end of the world, what other figuratiue sacrifice of Melchisedech they can find performed by Christ, by which it may appeare that he is a Priest for euer according to that order? Caluin (*li. 4. Instit. c. 18. para. 2.*) Kemnisus (*par. 2. exam. pag. 740. & 747*) Peter martyr (*in 1. Cor. 5.*) and most English Protestants grant that Melchisedech was a Priest, and that the peculiar function of a Priest is to offer Sacrifice, wherfore they hauing no Sacrifice wil haue only ministers and no Priests, but they denie that Melchisedech offered Sacrifice in bread and wine. VVherupon we ioyne issue with them to proue that he did, and that by this place amongst others of holie Scripture.

Kemnisus complayneth that the Latin text hath *obtulit* for *protulit*, *Offered*, for *brought forth*. And to disproue the same, he allegeth the Hebrew, Chaldee, Greke, and S. Cyprian. But Catholiques more iustly complaine of him, for lying. For al Latin Editions haue *Proferens*, *bringing forth*. The question therfore in controuersie is, to what end and vse Melchisedech brought forth bread and wine? Caluin and Kemnisius say it was only to refresh or feede Abraham and his men, and not for sacrifice, which their bare saying is without reason, for that there was store of victuals in the pray (*v. 11.*) and they had eaten therof. Moreouer the Hebrew word *hotsi*, *brought forth*, is a word pertayning to Sacrifice, as in the 6. chap of Iudges, (*v. 18. and 19.*) and importeth that *the bread and wine were first offered in Sacrifice, and then doubtles they did participat*:
