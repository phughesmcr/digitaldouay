## CHAP. II.

<aside>Moyses parents did prudently expose him to some danger, to auoide greater.</aside>

3. *When she could not conceal him*. ] These godlie and prudent parents, considering that when the Ægyptians should perceiue such an infant to be borne, and not drowned according to the Kings Edict, they would destroy both the child, and whole familie: to auoid the greater danger, chose the lesse. To bring him to the water side, not omitting their owne industrie, as wel by closing him in a basket, that would draw no water, as by setting his sister to watch what became of him: that if better successe happened not the first day, the mother might at euening geue him suck, and minister other necessaries: and so expect an other day, or manie dayes Gods prouidence, til his diuine pleasure should more appeare.

<aside>Reuelations and Gods determinations do not exclude mans endeuour.</aside>

[^1] Iosephus writeth that Amram Moyses father, being solicitous, when his wife was great, how to saue the infant, if it were a man child, God reueled to him, that she had conceiued a sonne, who should not only be saued from Pharaos furie, but also be the deliuerer of the whole Hebrew nation from thaldome, and seruitude of the Ægyptians. Whereupon they assuredly trusted that God would protect and prosper him, yet so, if they did their owne endeuour, which S. Augustin teacheth to be alwayes necessarie.

<aside>Though Moyses iustly killed the Ægyptian, yet others may not imitate his example.</aside>

12. *He slew the Ægyptian*. ] Moyses not of carnal loue towards his brethren, nor of priuate passion, but by diuine inspiration killed the Ægyptian, as S. Augustin proueth (li. 93. in Exod. q. 2.) by the testimonie of S. Steuen [^2] saying: *Moyses thought his brethren had vnderstood, that God by his hand, would saue them*. Whereby appeareth that Moyses himselfe knew it was Gods pleasure, he should kil that Ægyptian inuading an Hebrew. Yet others may not imitate such particular examples *Catech. Rom. p. 3. c. 6. q. 5.*

## CHAP. III.

*God appeareth to Moyses in a bush burning but not consuming. 7. designeth him the Gouernour of the children of Israel, 10. with commission to tel them, that they shal be deliuered from Ægypt: 13. and shal spoile the Ægyptians.*

1 AND Moyses fed the sheepe of Iethro his father in law the priest of Madian: and hauing driuen the flock to the inner partes of the desert, he came to the mountaine of God, Horeb. <sup>2</sup> And our Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middes of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire, and was not burnt. <sup>3</sup> Moyses therefore said: I wil goe, and see this great vision, why the bush is not burnt. <sup>4</sup> And our Lord seeing that he went forward to
