<sup>1</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, and Aaron, saying:

<sup>2</sup> Take the summe of the sonnes of Caath out of the middes of the Leuites, by their houses and families, <sup>3</sup> from the thirtith yeare & vpward, vnto the fiftith yeare, of al that goe in to stand and to minister in the tabernacle of couenant.

<sup>4</sup> This is the seruice of the sonnes of Caath: <sup>5</sup> when the campe is to remoue, Aaron and his sonnes shal enter into the tabernacle of couenant, and Sanctum sanctorum, and shal take downe the veile that hangeth before the dore, and shal wrappe in it the arke of testimonie, <sup>6</sup> and shal couer it agayne with a couer of ianthine skinnes, and shal spread ouer it a cloth al of hyacinth, and shal draw in the barres. <sup>7</sup> The tabel also of proposition they shal wrappe in a cloth of hiacinth, and shal put with it the censers and litle morters, the goblettes and cuppes to powre the libaments: the breades shal be alwayes on it: <sup>8</sup> and they shal spread ouer it a cloth of scarlet, which againe they shal couer with a veile of ianthine skinnes, and shal put in the barres. <sup>9</sup> They shal take also a cloth of hiacinth wherwith they shal couer the candlesticke with the lampes and tonges therof and snuffers and al the vessels of oyle, which are necessarie for the dressing of the lampes: <sup>10</sup> and ouer al they shal put a couer <sup>11</sup> of ianthine skinnes, and put in the barres. Moreouer the golden altar also they shal wrappe in a cloth of hyacinth, and shal spreade ouer it a couer of ianthine skinnes, and put <sup>12</sup> in the barres. Al the vessel wherwith the ministration is done in the Sanctuarie, they shal wrappe in a cloth of hiacinth and shal spread ouer it a couer of ianthine skinnes, and put in barres. <sup>13</sup> But the altar also they shal make cleane <sup>14</sup> from the ashes, and shal wrappe it in a purple cloth, and shal put with it al the vessel, that they vse in the ministerie therof, that is to say, fire pannes, fleshookes and forkes, pothookes and shouels. Al the vessel of the altar together they shal couer with a veile of ianthine skinnes, and shal <sup>15</sup> put in the barres. And when Aaron & his sonnes haue wrapped vp the Sanctuarie and the vessel therof in the remouing of the campe, then shal the sonnes of Caath enter in to carie the thinges wrapped vp: and they shal not touch the vessel of the Sanctuarie, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sonnes of Caath in the tabernacle of couenant: <sup>16</sup> ouer whom shal be Eleazar the sonne of Aaron

<aside>In this case it was necessarie for the prieste to enter in, where otherwise none entered but the high Priest, and that but once in the yeare. And al being soulded vp, others also entered to carie it away.</aside>
