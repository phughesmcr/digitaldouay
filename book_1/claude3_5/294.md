and the brest: and when he hath offered and consecrated
both to our Lord, he shal deliuer them to the priest, <sup>31</sup> who
shal burne the fatte vpon the altar, but the breast shal be Aa-
rons, and his sonnes. <sup>32</sup> The right shoulder also of the paci-
fique hostes shal fal for first fruites of the priest. <sup>33</sup> He of the
sonnes of Aaron, that offereth the bloud, and the fatte, him
selfe shal haue the right shoulder also for his portion. <sup>34</sup> For
the brest of eleuation and the shoulder of seperation I haue
taken of the children of Israel, from their pacifique hostes,
and haue geuen them to Aaron the priest, and to his sonnes,
by a lawe for euer, of al the people of Israel. <sup>35</sup> This is the
anoynting of Aaron and his sonnes, in the ceremonies of
our Lord, in the day when Moyses offered them, that they
might doe the function of priesthood, <sup>36</sup> and the thinges that
our Lord commanded to be geuen them of the children of
Israel, by a perpetual religion in their generations. <sup>37</sup> This is
the lawe of holocauste, and of the sacrifice for sinne, and for
an offence, and for consecration, and the victimes of paci-
fiques: <sup>38</sup> which our Lord apointed to Moyses in mount
Synai when he commanded the children of Israel, that they
should offer their oblations to our Lord in the desert of Synai.

ron with his sonnes, their vestimentes, and the oyle of
vnction, a calfe for sinne, two Rammes, a basket with azy-
mes, <sup>3</sup> and thou shalt gather al the assemblie to the dore of
the tabernacle. <sup>4</sup> And Moyses did as our Lord had com-
maunded. And al the multitude being gathered before the
dore of the tabernacle, <sup>5</sup> he said: This is the word, that
our Lord hath commanded to be done. <sup>6</sup> And immediatly
he offered Aaron & his sonnes: and when he had washed
them, <sup>7</sup> he reuested the high priest, with the strait linnen
garment, girding him with a bawdrike, and reuesting him
with the tunike of hyacinth, and ouer it he put the Ephod,
<sup>8</sup> which straining with the girdle, fitted it to the Ra-
tionale, wherin was Doctrine and Veritie. <sup>9</sup> with the
mitre also he couered his head: and vpon it, against the fore-
head, he put the plate of gold consecrated in sanctification,
