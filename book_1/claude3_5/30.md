Genesis.

To whom the woman answered: Of the fruite of the trees that are in paradise, we doe eate: <sup>3</sup>but of the fruite of the tree which is in the middes of paradise, God hath commanded vs that we should not eate: and that we should not touch it, lest perhapes we die. <sup>4</sup>And the serpent said to the woman: No you shal not dye the death. <sup>5</sup>For God doth know that in what day soeuer you shal eate therof, your eyes shal be opened: and you shal be as gods, knowing good & euil.
