<aside>How a man might marie his brothers wife in the law of nature.</aside>

8. *Raise seed to thy brother*? By this it appeareth, that in the law of nature, when a maried man died without issue, his brother might lawfully marie the widow: whose first sonne should be counted and called the sonne and heyre of his vncle dead before. The same was established by the law of Moyses (Deut. 25.) Which being now abrogated, it remaineth in the Churches powre to constitute a law in this behalf, and consequently to dispense in the same, so farre as is agreable with the law of nature. VVherof see more. Leuit. 18.

And Ioseph was of beautiful countenance, and comely to behold. <sup>7</sup> After manie dayes therfore his maistresse cast her eyes on Ioseph, and said: Sleepe with me. <sup>8</sup> Who in no wise assenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my maister hauing deliuered al thinges vnto me, knoweth not what he hath in his owne house: <sup>9</sup> neither is there any thing
