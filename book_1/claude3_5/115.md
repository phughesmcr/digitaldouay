GENESIS.

[^1]: Catholique Church. For so Rabanus a diligent obseruer and writer of Ecclesiastical Rites, Ceremonies, and Customes touching the vse of holie oyle witnesseth ( li. 1. c. 45. Institut. cleric. ) that the Altar being first sprinkled with water, is annointed with Chrisme, to the example of the Patriarch Iacob, who after that dreadful vision, erected a stone for a title (or monument ) powring oyle theron, and calling that place The house of God. S. Cyprian also writing of Chrisme, mentioneth the two sortes of holie oyle vsed in the Church: one of simple oyle consecrated by a Bishop, which is vsed for Catechumes before Baptisme, persons possessed, and the sick; the other is made of oyle and balme, also consecrated by a Bishop, and this is vsed in Baptisme, Confirmation, and in consecrating Altars, Kings, and Priests.

[^2]: Two sortes of holie oyle.

<aside>Vowes are properly of things which are not otherwise commanded.</aside>

20. *Vowed*] It cannot be vnderstood that Iacob here vowed, or promised only to serue God, as the Soueraigne Lord of al creatures, for to that he was bond, whether he should prosper temporally or no; but that he vowed particular godlie workes, to which he was not otherwise obliged. As here he expresseth two things. Presupposing before al, that the Lord Omnipotent shal be his God, he addeth, first *And this stone, which I haue erected for a title, shal be called the house of God.* wherby he promised the building of a Church, performed at his returne (chap. 35.) Secondly he added, *And of al things which thou shalt geue me I wil offer tithes to thee.* And this Likewise was of free deuotion. For tithes also in the law of nature were dew to Priests, and by inferior Priests to the chiefe Priest, as Abraham gaue tithes to Melchisedech. And so al his tithes were dew to his father, and after his father him selfe was chiefe: yet he promised them to God, that is, to offer them in Sacrifice, and bestow them in other vses pertaining to Gods seruice.

CHAP. XXIX.

*Iacob interteined by Laban, 15. serueth him seuen yeares for Rachel, 23. but first receiuing Lia, 27. seuen dayes after receiueth also Rachel, and serueth for her seuen yeares more. 31. She remaining barren, Lia beareth foure sonnes.*

1 IACOB therfore going on his iourney, came into the East countrie. <sup>2</sup> And he sawe a wel in the field, and three flockes of sheepe lying beside it: for of it the beasts were watered, and the mouth therof was closed with a great stone. <sup>3</sup> And the maner was when al the sheepe were geathered together they did rowle of the stone, and after the sheepe were refreshed they put it on the mouth of the wel againe. <sup>4</sup> And he said to the sheperds: Brethren, whence are you? Who answered: Of Haran. <sup>5</sup> And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban the sonne of Nachor? They said: We do knowe him. <sup>6</sup> Is he in health? quoth he. He is in health, say they: And behold Rachel his daughter cometh with
