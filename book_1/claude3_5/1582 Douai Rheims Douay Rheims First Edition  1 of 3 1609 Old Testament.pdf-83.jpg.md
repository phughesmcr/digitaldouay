appeareth sufficiently by that Sarai persuaded her owne husband, to marie an other wife, and he a true seruant of God agreed thereto, not as a new thing but what was then lawful, as a lawful practise of those times. And Moyses here and in other places stil speaketh of it, as of a custome knowne to the people for lawful. *If a man* (saith he) *haue two wiues, one beloued and the other hated, and they haue children to him, and the sonne of the hated be first borne, he can not preferre the sonne of the beloued*, wherby is clere that two wiues were then lawful, and the children of both legitimate, and that the first borne must be preferred, without respect of first or last mariage. Yet this dispensation either ceased before Christs time, the cause ceasing, when the world was replenished; or at least our Sauiour tooke it away, restoring Matrimonie to the first institution of two in one flesh. who pleaseth to see the Doctors that vnderstand, and expound the Scriptures to this effect, may read S. Augustin li. 22. c. 30. & 47. con. Faust. Manich. li. 16. c. 25, & 38. ciuit. & li. 1. de adulter. coniugijs. S. Chrisostom ho. 56. in Gen. S. Amb. li. de Abraham. c. 4. Also S. Chrisost. S.
