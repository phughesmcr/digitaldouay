Numeri, & Deuteronomie; whereunto answer in the new Testament, the foure Gospels of S. Matthew, S. Marke, S. Luke, & S. Iohn. Historical bookes of the old Testament, are the Bookes of Iosue, Iudges, Ruth, foure bookes of Kinges, two of Paralipomenon, Esdras with Nehemias, Tobias, Iudith, Hester, Iob, & two of the Machabees; vnto which, in the new Testament, answer the Actes of the Apostles. Sapiential, of the old Testament, are the Prouerbes, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Booke of wisdome, & Ecclesiasticus; and of like sorte are in the new Testament, the Epistles of S. Paul & of other Apostles. Prophetical bookes are Dauids Psalter (which is also Sapiential, yea likewise Legal and Historical) the Bookes of Isaias, Ieremias with Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, the twelue lesse Prophetes, Osea, Ioel, Amos, Abdias, Ionas, Michaeas, Nahum, Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus, Zacharias, Malachias.

<aside>Al these bookes recited are: Canonical, and of infallible truth.</aside>

Al these Bookes are vndoubtedly Canonical, as the Authores cited in the inner margent testifie. And consequently al, and al the partes therof, are of infallible truth. For otherwise as S. Augustin teacheth, if anie part were false, or doubtful, al were vncertaine. Once admitting falsehood (saith he, Epist. 8. ad Hieron) in such soueraigne authoritie, no parcel of these bookes should remaine, which anie way should seme hard to maners, or incredible to beleue, but it might by this most pernicious rule be turned to an officious fiction of the author. That is: If anie error could be committed by the authores of Scriptures, either through ignorance, obliuion, or anie other humane frailtie, whatsoeuer were produced, exception might be taken, and question made, whether the author had erred, or no? True it is, that some of these bookes (as we shal particularly discusse in their places) were sometimes doubted of by some Catholiques, and called Apochrypal, in that sense, as the word properly signifieth hidden, or not apparent. So S. Ierom (in his Prologue before the La足tin bible) calleth diuers bookes Apochryphal, being not so euident, whether they were Diuine Scripture, because they were not in the Iewes Canon, nor at first in the Churches Canon, but were neuer reiected as false or erronious. In which sense the Prayer of Manasses, the third booke of Esdras, and third of Machabees are yet called Apochryphal. As for the fourth of Esdras, and fourth of Machabees there is more doubt. But diuers others, as the booke ascribed to Enoch, the Gospels of S. Andrew, S. Thomas, S. Bartholmew, and the like recited by S. Gelasius (Decreto de libris Eccle足siasticis dist. 15. Can. Sancta Romana) S. Innocentius the first (Epist. 3.) S. Ierom, Ep. ad Laetam, S. Augustin li. 15. cap. 23. de ciuit. Dei. Origen homil. 1. in Cantica: are in a worse sense called Apochryphal, & are reiected as

<aside>Apochryphal of two sortes. 1. Not decla足red canonical. 2. Reiected as erronious.</aside>
