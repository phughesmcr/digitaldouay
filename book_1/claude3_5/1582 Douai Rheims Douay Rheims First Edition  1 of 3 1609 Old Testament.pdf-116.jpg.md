with his flocke. <sup>7</sup>And Iacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flockes into the foulds againe: first geue the sheep drinke, and so bring them backe to feede. <sup>8</sup>Who answered: We can not, til al the cattel be gethered together: and we remoue the stone from the wels mouth, that we may water the flockes. <sup>9</sup>They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her fathers sheepe: for she fed the flocke. <sup>10</sup>Whom when Iacob had seene, and knew her to be his cosen germaine, and that they were the sheepe of Laban his vncle: he remoued the stone, wherewith the wel was closed. <sup>11</sup>And hauing watered the flocke, he kissed her: and lifting vp his voice wept, <sup>12</sup>and he told her that he was her fathers brother, and the sonne of Rebecca: but she in hast went and told her father. <sup>13</sup>Who when he heard that Iacob his sisters sonne was come, he ranne forth to mete him: and embracing him, and hartely kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his iourney, <sup>14</sup>he answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the dayes of one moneth were expired, <sup>15</sup>he said to him: because thou art my brother, shalt thou serue me gratis? Tel me what wages wilt thou take. <sup>16</sup>He had in deede two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia: and the younger was called Rachel. <sup>17</sup>But Lia was bleare eyed: Rachel wel fauored, and of a bewtyful countenance. <sup>18</sup>Whom Iacob louing, said: I wil serue thee for Rachel thy younger daughter, seauen yeares. <sup>19</sup>Laban answered: It is better that I geue her to thee then to an other man, tary with me. <sup>20</sup>Iacob therefore serued for Rachel seuen yeares: and they semed a few dayes because of the greatnes of his loue. <sup>21</sup>And he said to Laban: geue me my wife: because now the time is complete, that I may companie with her. <sup>22</sup>Who hauing bid a great number of his freinds to the feast, made the mariage. <sup>23</sup>And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him, <sup>24</sup>geuing his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha. With whom when Iacob had companied after the maner, when morning was come he saw Lia: <sup>25</sup>and he said to his father in lawe: What is it that thou didest meane to doe? did not I serue thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceiued me? <sup>26</sup>Laban answered: It is not the custome in this place, that we bestowe the younger in mariage first. <sup>27</sup>Make vp the weeke of dayes of this
