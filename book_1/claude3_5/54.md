Genesis.

the bodies of the twelue sonnes of Iacob were translated from Sichem. As Io-[^1]
sephus writeth. And Sichem also was specially honored, because such per-
sons had benne buried there, as S. Hierom witnesseth, of his owne knowledge
in his time.

Againe by religious care of burying the dead in this first age, Enoch
was more certainly knowen to be Translated aliue, and not to be dead.
For the seuentie Interpreters, and S. Paul say <sup>5</sup>He was not found, which
importeth that they sought diligently for him: and that his bodie could not
be found, for God translated him.

By al which we see mutual offices, and communion of good workes a-
mongst good men aliue and dead, which is called Communion of Saincts.
And herein Angels lacked not their offices. For God (as Cherubins to keep
the gate of Paradise, that neither man should enter, being iustly expelled
for sinne, neither should the deuil, as S. Augustin noteth, lest he should take fruite of
the tree of life, and giuing it to men, allure them to more sinne. And many
Saincts being exalted to Angels glorie, haue like honorable offices towards
other men, as Angels haue. Yea the bloud of Abel vniustly shed by Cain,
and iustly to be reuenged by God, sheweth the peculiar honour, which God
bestoweth vpon his Saincts, for their vertues and merites in this life, & espe-
cially in their death. For Precious in the sight of our Lord, is the
death of his Saincts.

Hence also is proued, that seeing in this life the good are afflicted, and
the bad oftentimes prosper temporally, there must nedes be an other Court
of exact Iustice, and an other Reasening day, wherin euerie one shal
receiue, according as they haue donne good or euil. which was sufficiently
intimated by Gods discussing, and manifesting Abels and Cains deserts,
which were hidden before, and in part rewarding them accordingly, yet
reseruing the ful reward of the one, and punishment of the other to the
next world. Of the Iudge and his sentence Enoch (alleadged by S. Iude the
Apostle) prophecied clerly, saying: Behold our Lord cometh in his
holie thousands, to doe iudgement aganst al, and to reproue al
the impious, of al the workes of their impietie, wherby they
haue donne impiously, and of al the hard things which impious
sinners haue spoken against him. *This holie Enoch preached touching
the wicked, which thought there was no Iudgement to come, nor Iudge to
be feared*.

At this Iudgement al shal appeare in bodie and soule returning to life.
For that Al men shal rise from death is proued, by the immortalitie of
mans soule, which God did not make nor produce of corruptible matter, but
immediatly Breathed into his face the breath of life, and man be-
came a liuing soule. *so the soule being immortal, and hauing a natural*
