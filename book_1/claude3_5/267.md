leade forth this people: and doest not shew me whom thou wilt send with me, especially wheras thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast found grace in my sight. <sup>13</sup> If therfore I haue found grace in thy sight, shew me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before thine eyes, looke vpon thy people this nation. <sup>14</sup> And our Lord said: My face shal goe before thee, and I wil giue thee rest. <sup>15</sup> And Moyses sayd: If thy selfe doest not goe before, bring vs not out of this place. <sup>16</sup> For whereby shal we be able to know I and thy people, that we haue found grace in thy sight, vnles thou walke with vs, that we may be glorified of al peoples, that dwel vpon the earth? <sup>17</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: This word also, which thou hast spoken, wil I doe: for thou hast found grace before me, and thy selfe I haue knowen by name. <sup>18</sup> Who said: Shew me thy glorie. <sup>19</sup> He answered: I wil shew thee al good, and I wil cal in the name of the Lord before thee: and I wil haue mercie on whom I wil, and I wil be merciful to whom it shal please me. <sup>20</sup> And againe he sayd: Thou canst not see my face: for man shal not see me, and liue. <sup>21</sup> And againe: Behold, quoth he, there is a place with me, and thou shalt stand vpon the rocke. <sup>22</sup> And when my glorie shal passe, I wil sette thee in a hole of the rocke, and protect thee with my right hand, vntil I passe: <sup>23</sup> and I wil take away my hand, and thou shalt see my backe-partes: but my face thou canst not see.
