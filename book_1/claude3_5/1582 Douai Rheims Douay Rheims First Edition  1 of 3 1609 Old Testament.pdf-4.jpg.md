# To the English Reader

we shal repete the summe of al, that is there more largely
discussed. To this first question therefore we answer, that
both iust reason, & highest authoritie of the Church, iudge
it not absolutly necessarie, nor alwayes conuenient, that
holie Scriptures should be in vulgar tongues. For being as
they are, hard to be vnderstood, euen by the learned, reason
doth dictate to reasonable men, that they were not written,
nor ordayned to be read indifferently of al men. Experience
also teacheth, that through ignorance, ioyned often with
pride and presumption, manie reading Scriptures haue
erred grossly, by misunderstanding Gods word. Which
though it be most pure in it self, *yet the sense being adulterated* [^1]
(saith Tertullian) *as the wine corrupted*, S. Ambrose
obserueth: that *where the text is true, the Arrians interpreta-
tion hath errors*. S. Augustin also teacheth, that *heresies and
peruerse doctrines entangling soules, and throwing them downe
headlong into the depth, do not otherwisse spring vp, but when
good (or true) Scriptures are not wel (and truly) vnderstood, and
when that which in them is not wel vnderstood, is also rashly
& boldly auouched*. For the same cause, S. Ierom vtterly dis-
allowed, that al sortes of men & wemen, old & yong, pre-
sumed to read: & talke of the Scriptures: wheras *no artificer,
no tradsman dare presume to teach anie facultie, which he hath not
first lerned*. Seing therefore that dangers, & hurtes happen in
manie, the careful chief Pastores in Gods Church, haue al-
waies moderated the reading of holie Scriptures, accor-
ding to persons, times, and other circumstances: prohibi-
ting some, and permitting some, to haue and read them, in
their mother tongue. So S. Crysostom translated the Psalmes
& some other partes of holie Scriptures for the Arme-
nians, when he was there in banishment. The Slauonians
and Gothes say they haue the Bible in their languages. It
was translated into Italian by an Archbyshop of Genua.
Into French in the time of king Charles the fift: especially
because the waldensian heretikes had corruptly translated
it, to
