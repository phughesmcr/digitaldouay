<aside>Persecution profitable.</aside>

neither can we see during this life, how much good they do vs; nor know how manie of them shal be (as we hartely desire they al may be) saued: our Lord and Sauiour hauing paide the same price by his death, for them and for vs. Loue al therfore, pray for al. Do not lose your confidence, which hath a great remuneration. For yet a litle, and a very litle while, he that is to come, wil come, and he wil not slacke. Now the iust liueth by faith, beleeuing with hart to iustice, and confessing with mouth to saluation. But he that withdraweth himself shal not please Christs soule. Attend to your saluation, dearest countriemen. You that are farre of, draw nere, put on Christ. And you that are within Christs fold, kepe your standing, perseuere in him to the end. His grace dwel and remaine in you, that glorious crownes may be geuen you. AMEN.

<aside>Confession of faith before men necessarie to saluation.</aside>

From the English College in Doway, the Octaues of AL SAINCTES. 1609.

The God of patience and comfort geue you to be of one mind, one towards another in IESVS Christ: that of one mind, with one mouth you may glorifie God.
