See that thou doe al the wonders, which I haue put in thy hand, before Pharao: <sup>21</sup>I wil indurate his hart, and he wil not dismisse the people. <sup>22</sup>And thou shalt say to him: This sayth the Lord: My first begotten sonne is Israel. <sup>23</sup>I sayd to thee: dismisse my sonne that he may serue me, & thou wouldest not dismisse him: behold I wil kil thy first-begotten-sonne. <sup>24</sup>And when he was in his iourney, in the Inne, our Lord mette him, and would haue killed him. <sup>25</sup>Sephora by & by tooke a very sharp stone, and circumcised the prepuce of her sonne, & touched his feete, and sayd: A bloudie spouse art thou to me. <sup>26</sup>And he let him goe, after she had said, A bloudie spouse thou art to me, because of the circumcision. <sup>27</sup>And our Lord said to Aaron: Goe to Moyses into the desert. Who went forth to mete him vnto the Mountaine of God, and kissed him. <sup>28</sup>And Moyses told Aaron al the wordes of our Lord, by which he had sent him, & the signes that he had commanded. <sup>29</sup>And they came together, and gathered together al the ancientes of the children of Israel. <sup>30</sup>And Aaron spake al the wordes which our Lord had said to Moyses: and he wrought the signes before the people, <sup>31</sup>and the people beleued. And they heard that our Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked vpon their affliction: & they adored prostrate.

ANNOTATIONS  
CHAP. IIII.

1. *They wil not beleue me.*] Moyses wisely considering that the children of Israel, much lesse Pharao, would hardly beleue his bare woord, affirming that he was sent to them by God, proposed this difficultie before he tooke the Embassie vpon him. For without good proofe both the Israelites, and Egyptians might haue reiected him, as feeming to come of his owne priuate spirite, being no ordinarie superior, neither of the whole people, nor of his owne tribe, nor first of his familie: for Aaron was his elder brother. Therfore God gaue him power of working miracles, to proue his extraordinarie mission true and lawful. Which sufficed to make euen Pharao him selfe to know, that he was sent from God almightie, though it mollified not his stubborne hart, to obey Gods commandement: and it fully satisfied the children of Israel touching al things which he denounced, beleuing him that God mercifully looked vpon their affliction & would deliuer them. Wherupon they adored prostrate, as the last wordes of this chapter testifie. Where we see both the necessitie, and sufficiencie of miracles to proue the extraordinarie vocation of such as preach otherwise then was taught before. For this cause our Sauiour himselfe confir-
