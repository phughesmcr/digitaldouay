<sup>4</sup> And I wil multiplie thy seed as the starres of heauen: and I wil geue to thy posteritie al these countries: and in thy seed SHAL BE BLESSED al the nations of the earth, <sup>5</sup> because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my preceptes and commandements, and obserued my ceremonies & lawes. <sup>6</sup> Therefore Isaac abode in Gerara. <sup>7</sup> Who when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, answered: She is my sister. for he was afraid to confesse that she was married to him, thinking lest peraduenture they would kil him because of her beautie. <sup>8</sup> And when verie manie days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech the king of the Palestines looking forth through a windowe, sawe him sporting with Rebecca his wife. <sup>9</sup> And calling for him, he said: It is euident that she is thy wife: why didest thou faine her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her. <sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said: Why hast thou deceiued vs? some man of the people might haue lyen with thy wife, & thou haddest brought vpon vs a great sinne. And he commanded al the people, saying: <sup>11</sup> He that shal touch this mans wife, dying shal dye. <sup>12</sup> And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same yeare an hundred fold: and our Lord blessed him. <sup>13</sup> And the man was made rich, and he went prospering and encreasing, til he was made exceeding great: <sup>14</sup> and he had also possessions of sheep and of heards, and a verie great familie. For this the Palestines enuying him, <sup>15</sup> stopped at that time al the welles, that the seruants of his father Abraham had digged; filling them vp with water: <sup>16</sup> in so much that Abimelech himselfe said to Isaac: Depart from vs, because thou art become mightier then we a great deale. <sup>17</sup> And departing, to come to the Torrent of Gerara, and to dwel there: <sup>18</sup> againe he digged other welles, which the seruants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Philistines had stopped vp of old: and he called them by the same names, which his father before had called them. <sup>19</sup> And they digged in the Torrent, and found liuing water: <sup>20</sup> but there also the pastors of Gerara made a brawle against the pastors of Isaac, saying: It is our water. for which cause he called the name of the wel, by occasion of that which had hapned, Calumnie. <sup>21</sup> And they digged also an other: & for that they brawled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enimitie. <sup>22</sup> Going forward
