not ment of Abraham naturel children, but of the children of promise, such as the Romane Christians, and others, Iewes and Gentiles. So S. Iohn <sup>7</sup> saw in a vision as a certaine number of twelve thousand signed of euerie tribe of Israel, but after these a great multitude which no man could number of al nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues. To say therefore, as some old and new heretikes doe, that the church of Christ some times consisteth of few, or, inuisible persons, were to say God kept not promise with Abraham (Gen. 17.) and to make the bodie and thing figured, more obscure then the shadow and figures: seing in the whole time of the Law of nature, that is in these three first ages of the world, the Church being but a figure of that which is now, yet was alwayes visible and notorious, as hath benne declared. And that with perpetual succession of supreme heades, rulers and gouernors. As is before noted in the first age from Adam to Noe: in the second from Noe to Abraham: so in this third, by the right line of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Leui, Caath, and Amram, to Aaron and Moyses, (Exo. 6.) the Holie Ghost not there reciting more genealogies being come to the origine of the Priestly Tribe, that is to these two whom his diuine goodnes selected and ordained, as wel to speake to Pharao in behalf of the children of Israel, and to bring them out of the Land of Ægypt, as afterwards by one of them to giue his people a written Law, and in the other a perpetual promision of spiritual pastors. For in Aaron the elder brother God established an ordinarie succession of Priesthood, from that time to Christ, which before pertained to the firstborne in euerie familie: adioyning the rest of Leuites tribe to assist them, in administration of sacred things. But Moyses the younger brother was extraordinarily called (which God therefore shewed and confirmed by special miracles) not onlie to Priesthood, but also to be as the God of Pharao, Superior of Aaron, chiefe mediator between God and his people, as wel in deliuering them from the seruitude of Ægypt, and in receiuing the Law, and deliuering it to them, as in al other supreme gouernment spiritual and temporal during his life.
