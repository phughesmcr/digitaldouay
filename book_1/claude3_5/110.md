of his hunting, saying: Arise my father, and eate of thy
sonnes hunting: that thy soule may blesse me. <sup>32</sup> And Isaac
said to him: Why! who arth thou? Who answered: I am
thy first begotten sonne Esau. <sup>33</sup> Isaac was amazed and asto-
nied exceedingly: and marueling more then a man can
beleue, said: Who is he then that euen now brought me
venison that he had taken, and I did eate of al thinges before
thou camest? and I haue blessed him, and he shal be bles-
sed. <sup>34</sup> Esau hauing heard his fathers wordes, roared out with
a great crye: and being dismaid, said: Blesse me also, my fa-
ther. <sup>35</sup> Who said: Thy brother came deceitpfully and tooke
thy blessing. <sup>36</sup> But he said again: Rightly is his name called
Iacob: for he hath supplanted me loe the second time: my
first-birth-right he tooke before, and now the second time
he hath stollen my blessing. And againe to his father he said:
Hast thou not reserued me also a blessing? <sup>37</sup> Isaac answered:
I haue appointed him thy Lord, and al his brethren I haue
made subiect to his seruice: with corne and wine I haue esta-
blished him, and for thee, my sonne, what shal I doe more
after this? <sup>38</sup> To whom Esau said: Hast thou one only bles-
sing, father? I besech thee blesse me also. And when he wept
that he howled againe, <sup>39</sup> Isaac being moued, said to him:
In the fat of the earth, and in the deaw of heauen from
aboue <sup>40</sup> shal thy blessing be. Thou shalt liue by the sworde,
and shalt serue thy brother: and the time shal come, when
thou shalt shake of, and loose his yoake from thy necke:
<sup>41</sup> Esau therfore alwaies hated Iacob for the blessing wher-
with his father had blessed him: and he said in his hart: The
daies wil come of the mourning of my father, and I wil kil
Iacob my brother. <sup>42</sup> These things were told to Rebecca:
who sending & calling Iacob her sonne, said to him: Behold
Esau thy brother threatneth to kil thee. <sup>43</sup> Now therfore,
my sonne, heare my voice, and get thee vp and flye to Laban
my brother into Haran: <sup>44</sup> and thou shalt dwel with him a
few daies, til the furie of thy brother be asswaged, <sup>45</sup> and
his indignation cease, and he forget those things, which thou
hast done to him: afterward I wil send, and bring thee from
thence hither. Why shal I be depriued of both sonnes in one
day? <sup>46</sup> And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am wearie of my life
for the daughters of Heth: if Iacob take a wife of the stocke
of this land, I list not liue.
