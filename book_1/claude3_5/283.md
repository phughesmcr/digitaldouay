to the North, before our Lord: but the bloud therof the
sonnes of Aaron shal poure vpon the altar round about:
<sup>11</sup> and they shal diuide the ioyntes, the head, and al that
cleaue to the lyuer: and shal lay them vpon the wood, vnder
<sup>13</sup> which the fire is to be put: but the entrales and the feete
they shal wash with water. And the whole the priest shal
offer, and burne vpon the altar for an holocaust, and most
<sup>14</sup> sweete sauoure to our Lord. But if the oblation of holocaust
<sup>15</sup> to our Lord be of birdes, of turtles and young pigions, the
priest shal offer it at the altar: and wrething the head to
the necke, and breaking the place of the wound, he shal
make the bloud to runne downe vpon the brimme of the
<sup>16</sup> altar: but the croppe of the throate, and the fethers he
shal cast nigh to the altar at the east side, in the place where
<sup>17</sup> the ashes are wount to be powred out, and he shal breake
the pinnions therof, and shal not cut, nor diuide it with a
knife, and shal burne it vpon the altar, putting fire vnder
the wood. It is an holocaust and oblation of most sweete
sauoure to our Lord.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. I.

<aside>Sacrifice being the most special external seruice, whereby man acknowledgeth the supreme dominion of God, and his owne subiection and homage to his diuine Maiestie, was so wel knowen to be necessary (as being in most frequent vse in the law of nature, and in al nations) that here neded not anie new precept in general, that the people of God should offer sacrifice, though for special purposes, certaine particular sacrifices were some times appointed, but this dutie & obligation presupposed, our Lord first admonishing to offer the best, and perfectest things in euerie kind, prescribeth with what rites, and ceremonies it shal be done. As in offering an holocaust of the heard, it must be a male *without spotte*; and be offered *at the dore of the tabernacle*, the offerer *putting his handes vpon the head of the hoste*; *the priest must offer the bloud, powring it in the circuite of the altar*; *plucke of the skinne*; *cut the ioyntes in peeces*; *lay them in order*; *the entrales and feete being washed*, *burne al vpon the altar*: And the like in other sacrifices, al for iust and reasonable causes, without which the wisdome of God doth nothing. Sap. 7. & Psal. 103. v. 24.</aside>

[^1]: *The man that shal offer*] Sacrifice pre-supposed to be necessary, God prescribeth the rites to be obserued ther-in.

[^2]: *An holocaust*] In respect of diuers things offered, the diuers maner, and causes of offering, there were manie sortes of Sacrifices: but al are reduced to three kindes. The first was Holocaust, in which al was burned in the honour of God, and resolued into vapour, which ascendeth vpward: in signe that al we haue is of God. The second was Sacrifice for sinne, & that of diuers sortes, for the varietie of sinnes and persons; and part of this sacrifice was burned, the other part belonged to the Priests. The third was Pacifique sacrifice, wher-of one part was burnt, an other pertayned to the Priests, and an other to them that gaue the oblation. And of this kinde there were two sortes, one of
