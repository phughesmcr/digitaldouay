# THE SVMME AND PARTI-TION OF THE HOLIE BIBLE.

With a briefe note of the Canonical and Apochryphal Bookes.

<hr>

BY the vniforme consent of al learned Diuines, the holie Bible, or written word of God, conteyneth expressed or implied, al thinges that man is to belieue, to obserue, & to auoid, for ob-tayning of eternal saluation. That is, al matters of faith & maners, by which we may know and serue God, and so be spi-ritually ioyned with him, in this life, & in eternitie. For both the old & new Testament propose and testifie vnto vs, one and the same God, the same Christ, the same Church, and other Mysteries of our Religion, not differing in substance, but in maner of vttering: the Old more obscurely in types and pro-phecies foretelling those thinges, which the New declareth (in their time) to be done and performed. Wherupon saith S. Augustin: In the Old Testa-ment the New lieth hidden & in the New the Old lieth open. And touching their names; wherein appeareth difference, the one (saith the same Doctor) is called the old Testament, either because it pro-poseth promises of temporal thinges (Wherewith our old corruptnes is allured) Or in respect of the New, by which it is fulfilled, and in some part abolished. The other is called the New, because by it man is renewed, and hath promise of eternal life: Which shal neuer waxe old nor decay. Likewise S. Gregorie the great testifieth this con-formitie, and correspondence betwen the Old and New Testament, affirming that the same is signified by the Prophet Ezechiels vision of a wheele, which had foure faces, or apparence of foure wheeles, the shape whereof was, as it were, a wheele in the middes of a wheele. What is this (saith he) nisi quod in Testamenti veteris litera Testamentum nouum la-tuit per Allegoriam? but that in the letter of the old Testament, the New lay hidden by an Allegorie?

<aside>How the holie Scrip-tures conteino al knowlege necessarie to saluation. The old and the new Testa-ment shew the same God, Christ, Church and other My-steries of Re-ligion. The old more obscurely, with lesse helpes. The new more expresly and yeldeth more grace.</aside>

And as the same is the summe and subiect of both Testaments: so both are diuided (for the more principal partes therof) into foure sortes of Bookes: Legal, Historical, Sapiential, & Prophetical. The Legal bookes of the old Testament are the fiue Bookes of Moyses; Genesis, Exodus, Leuiticus, Numeri,
