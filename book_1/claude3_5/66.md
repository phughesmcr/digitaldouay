that they were forced to leaue of that bad worke, and withal to seeke more ample habitations, who if they had there more increased in number and strength, would without doubt (saith S. Chrisostom) haue attempted worse things. And in- <sup>10</sup>
finite manslaughter would haue benne committed, amongst so manie for pos- <sup>11</sup>
session of that one citie & towre. Finally the fathers note that as God wrought <sup>12</sup>
here much good by diuision of tongues: so he wrought much more by com-
munion of tongues, geuen to the Apostles, therby inabling them to gather one
Church of al Tongues and Nations.

<sup>11</sup> Begat Sale] Here is an intricate difficultie. For the Hebrew and Latin
text, both here and in Paralippomenon, saying Arphaxad begat Sale, the 72. <sup>1</sup>
Interpreters and S. Luke place Cainan betwen them, as sonne of Arphaxad, <sup>2</sup>
and father of Sale. Eusebius also in his Chronicle, with most Greeke Doctors, <sup>3</sup>
and S. Augustin, count Cainan in this Genealogie of Sem. Wherupon manie
do number him in this ranck, and suppose that Moyses omitted him for some
Mysterie, and yet writeth truly, that Arphaxad begat Sale, not his proper
sonne, but his sonnes sonne: as S. Mathew sayth, Ioram begat Ozias, who <sup>4</sup>
was his nephewes nephew. But against this solution it is replied, that then
Arphaxad should haue bene a grandfather at 35. yeares of age: which were
strange in those daies, how soeuer it is now. And a greatter difficultie, or
rather absurditie must also be granted, that Arphaxad begat both Cainan
at the age of 35. yeares, according to the 72. Interpreters, and that Sale was
also begotten the same yeare, according to the Hebrew: being both true.
Which inconuenience is not in the Genealogie written by S. Mathew.
Others therfore according to the Hebrew and Latin text, with most Latin
Doctors, omit Cainan in this place, and Paralipomenon, namely with S. Hie- <sup>5</sup>
rom, who diligently examining and reconciling varieties betwen the Hebrew
and the Greeke, maketh no mention at al of this difference. Which maketh
some to coniecture, that in S. Hieroms time Cainan was not in the Greeke
copies, at least not in those that he had, and held for the best. And at this day
some haue him not. Which may be admitted for a probable answere tou-
ching the Hebrew and Greeke of the old Testament. But for so much as al
copies, both Greeke & Latin, also S. Hieroms Edition of S. Lukes Gospel haue
Cainan, the difficultie stil remaineth betwen Moyses and S. Luke. How then
shal this doubt be solued? we can not solue it. And no maruel. For venerable
Bede could not. Whose wordes are these: S. Luke vseth rather the Greeke
testimonies then the Hebrew: wherof happneth that I much maruel at, and
for dulnes of wit, being striken with great admiration, I can not throughly
scan, seeing in the Hebrew veritie are found only tenne generations from the
floud vnto Abraham, by what meanes S. Luke, who (the Holie Ghost gouer-
ning his penne) could in no sorte write false, would rather set downe eleuen
generations in the Gospel, Cainan adioyned according to the seuentie Inter-
preters. Thus writeth S. Beda, reuerently admitting that he could not vnder-
stand. For being assured that the Holie Ghost gouerned the pennes both of
Moyses and S. Luke, and that he is not contrarie to him selfe, it must neides be
true which ech of them writeth, though other learned men can not reach the
profoundnes of some difficulties that occure. And therfore Beza was extreme
saucie to dash Cainan out of S. Lukes Gospel, and that wittingly and most
impudently saying, in his Annotations: *Non dubitauimus expungere: We doubted
not to put it out.* The former English Editions, otherwise corrupt in manie
places, haue Cainan in the text of S. Lukes Gospel, but their latter transla-
ters are in this point pure Bezites.
