# The signification of the markes here vsed, for direction of the reader.

The numbers in the argumentes of chapters point to the verse, where the matter mentioned beginneth.

This forme of crosse [†] in the text, sheweth the beginning of euerie verse.

The numbers in the inner margent ouer against the crosses, shew the number of verses in the same chapter.

This marke " signifieth that there foloweth an Annotation after the chapter, vpon the word, or wordes, wherto it is adioyned. The number also of the same verse is prefixed to the Annotation.

These foure prickes :: shew that there is an Annotation in the margent, vpon that place. And when manie occurre, the first answereth to the first marke, the second to the second, and so forth. In like maner the citations of places in the inner margent, are applied to the authores alleaged.

But when there be more such marginal annotations, then may easely be applied, we vse the letters of the Alphabete for direction.

This forme of a starre [*] in the text or annotations, pointeth to the explication of some word or wordes, in the margent.

Sometimes we put the Concordance of other Scriptures in the inner margent of the text.

We haue also noted in the margent, whan the Bookes of holie Scripture (or partes thereof) are read in the Churches Seruice. For their sakes, that desire to read the same, in order of the Ecclesiastical Office.
