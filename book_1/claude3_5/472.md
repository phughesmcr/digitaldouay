<aside>Thus most commonly were curses vsed in the old Testament, but such as now serue not God rightly, and yet prosper in this world, shal in a moment descend into hel. *Psal. 72.*</aside>

Blessings: <sup>15</sup> But if thou wilt not heare the voice of our Lord thy God, to keepe, and doe al his commandmentes and ceremonies, which I command thee this day, al these curses shal come vpon thee, and ouertake thee. <sup>16</sup> Cursed shalt thou be in the citie, cursed in the field. <sup>17</sup> Cursed shal thy barne be, and cursed thy remaines. <sup>18</sup> Cursed shal be the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy ground, the heardes of thy oxen, and the flockes of thy sheepe. <sup>19</sup> Cursed shalt thou be comming in, and cursed going out. <sup>20</sup> Our Lord shal send vpon thee famine & hunger, and rebuke vpon al the workes, which thou shalt doe: vntil he consume, and destroy thee quickly, for thy most wicked inuentions, wherein thou hast forsaken me. <sup>21</sup> Our Lord sette the pestilence vpon thee, vntil he consume thee out of the land, which thou shalt enter in to possesse. <sup>22</sup> Our Lord strike thee with pouertie, with the feuer and cold, with burning and heate, and with corrupt ayre and blasting, and pursew thee til thou perish. <sup>23</sup> Be the heauen, that is ouer thee, of brasse: and the ground, that thou treadest, of yron. <sup>24</sup> Our Lord geue dust for rayne vpon thy land, and ashes descend from heauen vpon thee, til thou be consumed. <sup>25</sup> Our Lord deliuer thee to fal downe before thyne enemies: one way goe thou forth against them, and flee seuen, and be thou dispersed through out al the kingdomes of the earth: <sup>26</sup> and be thy carcasse meate to al the fowles of the ayre, and beastes of the earth, and be there none to driue them away. <sup>27</sup> Our Lord strike thee with the boile of Ã†gypt, and the part of thy bodie, by the which dung is cast out, with scabbe also and itche: so that thou canst not be cured. <sup>28</sup> Our Lord strike thee with madnes & blindnes and furie of minde, <sup>29</sup> and grope thou at midday, as the blinde is wont to grope in the darke, and direct not thy wayes. And at al times susteyne thou wrong, and be thou oppressed with violence, neither haue thou any to deliuer thee. <sup>30</sup> Take thou a wife, and an other sleepe with her. Build thou a house, and dwel not therin. Plant thou a vineyard, and take not the vintage thereof. <sup>31</sup> Be thy oxe immolated before thee, and thou not eate therof. Be thy asse taken away in thy sight, and not restored to thee. Be thy sheepe geuen to thyne enemies, and be there none to helpe thee. <sup>32</sup> Be thy sonnes and thy daughters deliuered to an other people, thyne eies seing, and dascling at the sight of them al the day, and be there no strength in thy
