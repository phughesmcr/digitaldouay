Mariage with the brothers wife, he dying without issue.

<aside>448 when the first brother dying left issue. For dying without issue, his brother was bound by this law to marie the widow. In default of the brother, the next of kinne was to marie her: and for default of neerer, the more remote. So Booz maried Ruth. Neither was it contrarie, but agreable to the law of nature, to marie the brothers wife when he was dead without issue, as is before noted. *Ruth. 1. & 4.*</aside>
