forth out of the affliction of Ægypt, into the land of the
Chananeite, and Hetheite, and Amorrheite, and Pherezeite,
and Heueite, and Iebuseite, to a Land that floweth with
milke & honie. <sup>18</sup> And they shal heare thy voice: and thou
shalt enter in, thou and the ancientes of Israel to the king
of Ægypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the
Hebrewes hath called vs: We wil goe three dayes iourney
into the wildernes, to sacrifice vnto the Lord our God.
<sup>19</sup> But I know that the king of Ægypt wil not dismisse you
<sup>20</sup> to goe but by mightie hand. <sup>21</sup> For I wil stretch forth my
hand, and wil strike Ægypt in al my maruels, which I wil
doe in the middes of them: after these he wil dismisse you.
<sup>22</sup> And I wil geue grace to this people, in the sight of the
Ægyptians: and when you shal goe forth, you shal not
depart emptie: <sup>23</sup> but ech woman shal aske of her neigh-
bour and of her that is in house with her, vessels of siluer
and of gold, and rayment: and you shal lay it vpon your
sonnes and daughters, and shal spoyle Ægypt.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. III.

[^1] *Our Lord appeared.* ] S. Steuen reciting this vision saith, an Angel ap-
peared to Moyses: and so it is in the Hebrew text, in the Chaldee Paraphrasis,
and in the Septuagint Interpreters. Neither is the latin Edition (reading *Lord*)
contrarie to the other which reade *Angel*, no more then one place of holie
Scripture, is contrarie to an other in the same language, but very consonant in
sense, sometimes attributing the same apparitions and other workes to God,
as the author and principal Agent, and sometimes to Angels, the next and im-
mediate ministers of God. For so not only S. Steuen in the place alleaged, but
also S. Paul saith plainly (Gal. 3.) that the *Law was deliuered by Angels*. And in
his Epistle to the Hebrewes, proueth the excellencie of Christs Law aboue
the old law, by the difference of the persons, by whom both were geuen: affir-
ming that the former *was spoken by Angels*, the other declared *by our Lord Iesus*
Christ. Wherof S. Cyril of Alexandria discourseth largely (li. 8. c. 2. Thesau.)
shewing that in deede Angels deliuered the law, yet not by their owne autho-
ritie, but as seruants and legates of God. And before him S. Dionyse of Ario-
pagus (li. cœlest. Hierar. c. 4.) taught the very same, the *law* (sayeth he) *as
holie veritie testifieth, was geuen vnto vs by Angels*: yea al apparitions, made to the an-
cient fathers before the law, and after, were made by Angels. A litle after ob-
iecting to himselfe, that diuine Scriptures also testifie, that the Law was geuen
and granted to Moyses by God, to teach vs that in deede it hath the forme of
sacred and diuine law, answereth, *cum Angelorum ad nos opera peruenisse, that it
came to vs* [ from God ] *by the meanes of Angels*. In like maner S. Iustinus
Martyr

[^2] Al that anie
man possesseth
in this world,

God. And ther

taketh away,
and lendeth to
others; dispo-

pleaseth him.
