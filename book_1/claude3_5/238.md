and Rebecca of great sinnes (<sup>4</sup>) reprehendeth Iudas Machabeus for superstitious, and preposterous zeale, in causing Sacrifice to be offered for the dead. In his commentarie (in 32. Exodi) he accuseth most holie and meke Moyses of arrogancie and pride. And (li. 3 fastit. c. 10. pa. 27) he scuruely senteth at al Sainctes in general, saying, If they heare mortal mens prayers, they must haue eares so long, as from heauen to earth. And calleth them not only *hemi-thei mortales, deid men*, (which S. Hierom reproued in Vigilantius) but also *nubivagi, lunares, caelicolas: shadowers, night goblins, starlinge filth* yea more, (li. de vera relig. tected. rai) he calleth them *Monsters, carnifices, belluas, nounters, hangmen, beasts*. These and like blasphemies modest men can not but abhore and detest. Their lies also are conuinced by S. Hierom, handling this matter of purpose against Vigilantius, by S. Augustin touching it by occasion (li. 20. c. 21.) against Faustus the Manichey, Thomas Waldensis (To. 3. tit. 13 de sacramentalibus) against wiclife by al Catechismes and Christian Instructions, teaching nothing like, but quite contrarie to these mens reportes. In summe they al teach, that Sainctes are to be honored with religious honour, which is greater then ciuil, but infinitly inferiour to diuine, as the excellencie of God surmounteth al excellencie created.

For better declaration wherof, it is to be considered, that being by the law of God and nature, honour is due to excellencie, there must be so manie distinct kindes of honour as there be general kindes of excellencie, which are three. The first of God, infinite, and incomparably aboue al: the second is supernatural but created, as of grace and glorie: the third is humane or natural, consisting in natural giftes, or worldlie powre and dignitie, al three as distinct as God, heauen, and earth. To these three general kindes of excellencie perteine therfore other three as distinct kindes of honour: to wit, Diuine due to God only, called by vse and appropriation of a greeke word *latria*: the second *dulia*, belonging to Sainctes, and other holie things, eleuated by God aboue the course of nature, in diuers degrees, but within the ranck of creatures: the third is ciuil honour, due to humane and worldlie excellencie, according to diuers states and qualities of men. The first of these which is diuine, may in no case be geuen to anie creature, how excellent soeuer. The third which is ciuil, as both Catholiques and Protestants hold for certaine, is not competent nor agreable to Sainctes, but to mortal worldlie men in respect of temporal excellencie. Al the controuersie therfore is about the second. Which Caluin (li. 1. instit. c. 11. & 12.) and al protestant writers denie & reiect, and so would haue no honour at al geuen to Sainctes. Obiecting as old heretikes did, that Catholiques do al the same external actes, as standing bare head, bowing, kneeling, praying, and the like to Sainctes, as to God himself. We answer, that the distinction of honour consisteth not alwayes in the external action, but in the intention of the mind. For when we do such external actes of honour to God, we intend therby to honour the Creator and Lord of al, and so it is diuine honour, but doing the same external actes to a Saint, we conceiue of him, as a glorious seruant of God, and for honour him as a sanctified and glorified creature, Gods subiect and seruant. Without this diuersitie of intentions in your mind, you can not shew difference, betwene the honour you do to God, and that you do to the King, by bowing, kneeling, and the like. For it is the same external action: yet no Christian doubteth but he honoreth God with diuine honour, & the King with ciuil. Againe we answer, that we do not al the external actions of honour to Sainctes, which we doe to God. For Sacrifice is donne only to God, and to no Saint; and because Altares perteine to Sacrifice, they
