<aside>Rite and extraordinarie calling: Aaron was high priest for his Pontifical inuesture, and ordinarie vocation, which should conti-new in his successors. 4. 23. in Leuit.</aside>

LEVITICVS.

Consecration of azymes, which was before our Lord, a loafe without leauen, and a manchet tempered with oile, and a wafer he put them vpon the fatte, and the right shoulder, <sup>27</sup> deliuering also to Aaron, and to his sonnes. Who hauing lifted them vp before our Lord, <sup>28</sup> he tooke them againe of their handes, and burnt them vpon the altar of holocaust, because it was the oblation of consecration, for a swete odoure, of the sacrifice to our Lord. <sup>29</sup> And he tooke of the ramme of consecration, the brest for his portion, eleuating it before our Lord, as our Lord had commanded him. <sup>30</sup> And taking the oyntment, and the bloud that was vpon the altar, he sprinckled it vpon Aaron, and his vestiments, & vpon his sonnes and their vestiments. <sup>31</sup> And when he had sanctified them in their vestiments, he commanded them, saying: Boile the flesh before the dore of the tabernacle, and there eate it. Eate ye also the loaues of consecration, that are laid in the basket, as our Lord commanded me, saying: Aaron and his sonnes shal eate them: <sup>32</sup> and whatsoeuer shal be left of the flesh, and the loaues, fire shal consume. <sup>33</sup> Out of the dore also of the tabernacle you shal not goe forth seuen daies, vntil the day wherin the time of your consecration shal be expired. for in seuen dayes the consecration is finished: <sup>34</sup> as at this present it hath bene done, that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished. <sup>35</sup> Day & night shal you tarie in the tabernacle obseruing the watches of our Lord, lest you die: for so it hath bene commanded me. <sup>36</sup> And Aaron, and his sonnes did al thinges which our Lord spake by the hand of Moyses.

<aside>Particular calling and consecration necessarie to priestlie offices, & authoritie in spiritual causes.</aside>

[^1] *Offered Aaron*] By this maner of taking, offering, and consecrating Aaron High Priest, S. Paul sheweth that none may aspire to them selues, nor presume to exercise priestlie offices, or anie authoritie in spiritual causes, but such as be orderly called therto. Yea that Christ him self would not haue exercised this function, but that he was also called of God vnto it, saying: E-uerie High Priest taken from among men, is appointed for men, in these thinges that pertaine to God. Neither doth anie man take the honour to himself, but he that is called of God, as Aaron. So Christ also did not glorifie himself, that he might be made a High Priest: but he that spake to him: *Thou art a Priest for euer, according to the order of Melchisedech*. Aarons sonnes were also called, but to lower offices, dignities, and authoritie. And both he and they were ordained and consecrated by a peculiar Sacrament, to wit, by certaine determinate ex-
