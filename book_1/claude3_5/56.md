## Chapter VIII.

<aside>The second age of the world.</aside>

<aside>The third part of this booke. Of the newin crease & multiplication of the world.</aside>

AND God remembred Noe, and al the beasts, and al the cattle, which were with him in the arke, and brought a winde vpon the earth, and the waters decreased. <sup>2</sup> And the fountaines of the depth, and the floud gates of heauen, were shut vp: and the rayne from heauen was stayd. <sup>3</sup> And the waters returned from the earth going & comming: and they begane to decrease after a hundred fiftie dayes. <sup>4</sup> And the arke rested the seuenth moneth, the seuen & twentith day of the moneth vpon the mountaines of Armenia. <sup>5</sup> But the waters for al that were going and decreasing vntil the tenth moneth: for in the tenth moneth, the first day of the moneth, the topps of the mountaines appeared. <sup>6</sup> And after that fourtie dayes were passed, Noe opening the windowe of the arke, which he had made, let forth a crowe: <sup>7</sup> which went forth, and did not returne, til the waters were dried vpon the earth. <sup>8</sup> He sent forth also a doue after him, to see if the waters were ceased yet vpon the face of the earth. <sup>9</sup> Which finding not where her foote might rest, returned to him into the arke: for the waters were vpon the whole earth: and he stretched forth his hand, and caught her and brought her into the arke. <sup>10</sup> And hauing expected yet seuen moe dayes, againe he let forth a doue out of the arke. <sup>11</sup> But she came to him at euentide, carrying a bough of an oliue tree, that had greene leaues in her mouth. Noe therfore vnderstood that the waters were ceased vpon the earth. <sup>12</sup> And he expected yet neuertheles other seauen dayes: and he sent forth a doue, which returned not any more vnto him. <sup>13</sup> Therfore in the sixt hundred and one yeare, the first moneth, the first day of the moneth the waters were cleane diminished vpon the earth: and Noe opening the roofe of the arke, looked, and sawe that the face of the earth was dried. <sup>14</sup> In the second moneth, the seuen & twentyth day of the moneth the earth was dried. <sup>15</sup> And God spake to Noe, saying:

<aside>The crowe returned not into the arke, but (as appeareth by the He brew text) going and returning rested vpon the arke.</aside>

<aside>They entred into the arke the 17. day, the second moneth of the other yeare: so they remained there 12. monethes and tenne dayes.</aside>

[^1]: The waters diminishing by litle and litle, 6. Noe sendeth forth a crowe, 8. after him a doue, thrise: 18. lastly goeth forth with al that were with him in the arke. 20. erecteth an Altar, and offereth Sacrifice.
