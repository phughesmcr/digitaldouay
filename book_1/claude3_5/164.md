# Genesis

[^1]: Special place of burial law­fully desired, and spiritually profitable.

<aside>30. I wil sleepe with my fathers] Albeit neither the lack of burial, nor care­lesse not consummate with dead bodies, can annoy the iust, for they shal rise againe: yet it is both a lawful natural desire, and a spiritual comfort and profit, to be buried in special places, where their owne frends, or holie persons are buried, or where God is more specialy serued, Sacrifice, and other praiers offered. And so both Iacob and Ioseph desired to rest in the land of Chanaan, where their parents were buried, and where Christ should be borne and redeeme mankind.</aside>

<aside>But pompe auaileth not the dead.</aside>

But worldie pompe and honour of funerals, are rather the comfort of the liuing, then the reliefe of the departed, as S. Augustin teacheth, in Psal 115. For in the sight of men, the troupe of seruants (saith the same S. Augustin lib. 1. c. 13. de ciuit.) made so­lemne and glorious exequies to the rich glutton, that was clothed in silk, and fared delicately in his life, but in the sight of God, the Angels ministered made far more excellent to poore Lazarus, though they caried not his bodie into a marble tombe, but his soule into Abrahams bosome.

[^2]: The Septua­gint are not contrarie to the Hebrew and Latin text, but sup­plie that was omitted.

<aside>31. To the bed head.] S. Paul alleaging this place saith: Iacob adored the top of (Ioseph) his rod, folowing the Septuagint, who for the same Hebrew word (being without points, that is, without vowels) in this place say, rod, and in the next chapter (v. 2.) interpret bed. For Matteh signifieth a rod, and Mittah, a bed. The Latin therfore translating bed, as the Hebrew is pointed, and the Septuagint, and S. Paule reading rod, both are true, and both together ex­presse the whole action, that Iacob taking Iosephs rod into his hand, and tur­ning to the bed head, leaned on the top of the rod, and adored not only God, the Lord and geuer of al good, but also his sonne Ioseph now the chiefe ruler and Prince of Ægypt: as S. Augustin expoundeth. q. 162. in Gen. And herein saith S. Chrisostom (ho. 66. in Gen.) Iosephs dreame was fulfilled, that the sunne and moone should adore him. The like saith Theoderet (q. 108 in Gen) And Pro­copius addeth that Iacob adoring Iosephs rod, adored also Christs kingdome, prefigured by the same rod. But how Adoration of creatures redoundeth to the honour of God, more is noted vpon the said place of S. Paul. Heb. 11.</aside>

<aside>Adoration of God and crea­tures is not repugnant.</aside>

## Chap. XLVIII.

*Ioseph visiteth his father being sick. 5. Who adopteth his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim, 14. and blesseth them, preferring the younger before the elder, contrarie to Iosephs mind. 22. And geueth a portion of land to Io­seph, aboue his brethren.*

THESE things being so done, it was told Ioseph that his <sup>1</sup>father was sicke: who, taking his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim, went forward. † And it was told the old man: <sup>2</sup>Behold thy sonne Ioseph cometh to thee, Who being strengthned sate on his bed. † And Ioseph being entred in <sup>3</sup>to him, he said: God almightie appeared to me in Luza, which is in the Land of Chanaan: and He blessed me, † and sayd: <sup>4</sup>I wil increase, and multiplie thee, and make thee into mul­titudes
