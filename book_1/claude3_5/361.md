the Leuites in the sight of Aaron and of his sonnes, and being
<sup>14</sup> offered shal consecrate them to the Lord, and shal separate
them from the middes of the children of Israel, to be mine.
<sup>15</sup> And afterward they shal enter into the tabernacle of coue-
nant, to serue me. And thou shelt so purifie and consecrate
them for an oblation of the Lord: because they were geuen
<sup>16</sup> me for a gift of the children of Israel. <sup>17</sup> For the first borne
that open euerie matrice in Israel, I haue taken them. For
mine are al the first borne of the children of Israel, as wel of
men as of beastes. From the day that I smote euerie first
borne in the Land of Ægypt, haue I sanctified them to me:
<sup>18</sup> and I haue taken the Leuites for al the first borne of the
<sup>19</sup> children of Israel: <sup>20</sup> and haue deliuered them for a gift to
Aaron and his sonnes out of the middes of the people, to
serue me for Israel in the tabernacle of couenant, and to
pray for them that there be no plague among the people, if
they should presume to approch vnto my Sanctuarie. <sup>21</sup> And
Moyses and Aaron and al the multitude of the children of
Israel did concerning the Leuites the thinges that our Lord
<sup>22</sup> had commanded Moyses: <sup>23</sup> and they were purified, and
washed their garmentes. And Aaron :: eleuated them in the
sight of our Lord, and prayed for them, that being purified
they might enter to their offices into the tabernacle of co-
uenant before Aaron & his sonnes. Euen as our Lord had cõ-
<sup>24</sup> manded Moyses touching the Leuites, so was it done. <sup>25</sup> And
our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>26</sup> This is the law of the
Leuites, From twentie fiue yeares and vpward, they shal en-
<sup>27</sup> ter in to minister in the tabernacle of couenant. <sup>28</sup> And when
they shal haue accomplisheth the fiftith yeare of their age,
they shal cease to serue: <sup>29</sup> and shal be the ministers of their
brethren in the tabernacle of couenant, to keepe the thinges
that are cõmended to them, but not to do the verie workes.
Thus shalt thou dispose to the Leuites in their custodies.
