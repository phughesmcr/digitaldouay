destroyed. As S. Hilarie (*li.7. de Trinitate*) & S. Gregorie (*ho. 8. in Ezech.*) note upon this place. Likewise Priests are called goddes [Exod 22. v. 28.] for their sacred function, pertaining to Religion and Service of God. Prophetes also are called *principes, Seer* [1. Reg. 9.] because by participation of divine knowledge, they see sometimes the secretes of other mens hartes, things supernatural, and future contingent, though properly and naturally onlie God almightie is *scrutator corda, the searcher of the hart*, and knoweth al things [*Sap. 1.*] Againe S. Peter saith [2. *Epist. c. 1.*] that *we are made partakers of divine nature*. Which is rather more then to participate in name. Al which titles rightly pertened to Moyses, being in like Holie, in knowledge a Prophete, in function a Priest, and in power a Prince. In the same sense of participation, Sainctes are called our Mediatours, Aduocates, Redeemers, Deliuerers, and the like.

<sup>3</sup> *I wil indurate*] According to our purpose mentioned in the Annotations upon the 9. chap. to the Romanes, we shal here recite the summe of S. Augustins doctrine [*Ser. 88. de tempore*] touching the hard question: How God did indurate Pharaoes hart. And withal we shal briefly explicate, according to the doctrine of the same, & other most learned Fathers of the Church, the true sense of this and like places, by which Zuinglius, Caluin, Beza, and other Sectaries, would proue that God not only permitteth, but also commandeth, inciteth, inforceth, and compelleth men to do that which is sinne: yea that God is the author, internal mouer, & inforcer, that man transgresseth; though they denie that God sinneth or is cause of the malice of sinne. For example, Zuinglius [*Ser. de prouidentia Dei, ca. 5.*] saith: *Cum igitur Angelum transgressorem facit, & hominem, ipse tamen transgressor non est, author est eius, quod nobis est iniustitia, illi vero nullatenus est*. The diuine power itself is author of that thing, which to vs is iniustice, but to him in no wise is. And a litle after, *Cum igitur Angelum transgressorem facit, & hominem, ipse tamen non transgreditur, qui non est sub lege, VVhen therfore God maketh Angel, and man transgressors, yet himself is not made a transgressor*. Cha. 6. *Vnum atque idem facinus, puta adulterium aut homicidium, quantum Dei est authoris, motoris, impulsoris, opus est, crimen non est: quantum hominis est, crimen ac scelus est*. Therfore the selfsame act, as adulterie or manslaughter, as it is of God the author, mouer, inforcer, is a worke, is not a crime: but as it is of man, it is a crime & a wicked act. Caluin [*l. 8. Instit. c. 17. para. 1.*] affirmeth that the diuel, & the whole band of the wicked can not conceiue, nor endeuoure, nor do anie mischief, *nisi quantum Deus permiserit, imo nisi quantum ille mandauit*: but so farre as God permitteth [which al Catholiques firmly beleeue] *nay but so far as he commandeth*: which al Catholiques abhorre and detest. Likewise [*li. 1. c. 4. para. 4*] alleging Gods wordes, *I wil be aggrauated, and harden Pharaoes hart*, affirmeth, that which God did more, besides not mollifying his hart, was, *quod obstinatione pectus eius obfirmandum Satanae mandauit*, that he committed his hart to Satan to be hardened with obstination: making God the author, and Satan only the minister of hardning Pharaos hart. Beza folowing this sense [*in Respon. ad Castellionem, Apolog. 2.*] saith, God [so wretchedly and miserably] *not only suffereth them to worke, nor only moderateth the euent, sed etiam excitat, impellit, mouet, regit, atque adeo [quod omnium est maximum] etiam creat, vt per illa agat quod constituit*: but also stirreth them vp, driueth them forward, moueth them, ruleth them, and [which is most of al] euen createth them, that by them he may worke that which he appointed. Al which [saith he] *God doth iustly, and without anie iniquistie*. So in dede these men say, when they are pressed with the blasphemous absurditie, that they make God author and cause of sinne, which necessarily and euidently foloweth of their doctrin. For by the very light of nature, it is clere, that the commander or inforcer is author
