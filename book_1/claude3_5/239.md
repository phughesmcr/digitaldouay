they are erected to God only, though oftentimes in memorie of Saints.

Both which answer S. Augustin gaue long since, to Faustus the Manachie, S. Augustin declareth this doctrine: and proueth both the former answers.

arguing that Catholiques by doing the same external actes, worshipped Martyrs with diuine honour, and so turned them into Idols, as that heretike inferreth. Wherupon S. Augustin declareth, that Christian people celebrate<sup>10</sup> together the memories of Martyrs with *Religious solemnities*, to styr vp imitation,<sup>11</sup> to be partakers of their merites, and to be holpen by their prayers. Yet so that<sup>12</sup> we erect not Altares (because they are not Sacrifice) to anie Martyrs, but to God of Martyrs. For who euer standing at the<sup>13</sup> Altar, in places of Sainctes bodies, saide: VVe offer to thee Peter, or Paul, or<sup>14</sup> Cyprian, but that which is offered, is offered to God, who crowned the Mar-<sup>15</sup> tyrs, at their memories, whom he crowned, that by commonition of the very<sup>16</sup> places, greater affection may arise, to inkindle charitie, both towards them,<sup>17</sup> whom we may imitate, and towards him, by whose helpe we may. VVe ho-<sup>18</sup> nour Martyrs with that worship of loue and societie, wherewith holie men are<sup>19</sup> worshipped in this life, VVhose hart we perceiue is prepared to like sufferance<sup>20</sup> for the Euangelical veritie: but Martyrs more deuoutly, by how much more<sup>21</sup> securely, after al vncertainties are ouercome, and with how much more confi-<sup>22</sup> dent praise, we preach them now victours in a more happie life, then others<sup>23</sup> yet fighting in this. But with that worshippe, which in greke is called *Latria*,<sup>24</sup> & *more properly due to God*, which in Latin can not be expressed by one word,<sup>25</sup> we neither worship, nor teach to be worshipped but one God. And for so<sup>26</sup> much as offering of Sacrifice pertaineth to this worshippe ( wherof they<sup>27</sup> are called Idolaters, that offer sacrifice to anie Idols ) we by no meanes<sup>28</sup> offer anie such thing, nor teach to be offered, either to anie Martyr, or<sup>29</sup> blessed soule, or holie Angel. Thus saith S. Augustin. The same teacheth Theo-<sup>30</sup> doret (*li. 8. ad Graecos*.) Our Lord hath depriued false goddes of the honour,<sup>31</sup> they had in Temples, and in place of them caused his Martyrs to be honored:<sup>32</sup> yet not in the same maner, for we neither bring hostes, nor libaments to<sup>33</sup> Martyrs, but honour them, as holie men, and most deare freinds of God. It<sup>34</sup> would be to long to cite manie ancient Fathers, testifying and teaching that<sup>35</sup> Saincts are to be honored.

More compendiously we wil take our aduersaries confession, the Mag-
deburgian Centuriators. VVho (*Praef. Cent. 6.*) holding that the Church was
only pure from idolatrie the first hundred yeares of Christ, and that it begane
to faile in the second and third age, more in the fourth and fifth, and was
vtterly perished in the sixth, impute the cause of her ruine, that the very chiefe
men taught and practised the honour of Saints. First of al (say they) these hor-
rible and pernicious darknes, as certaine black cloudes couering the whole
firmament, rose vp in the verie assemblie of teachers. For that partly the very
Doctors of the Church, partly other superstitious men, augmented ceremo-
nies and humane worshippes in the Temples. For sacred houses began to be
built in al places, with great coste, altogether in heathnish maner: not prin-
cipally to the end, Gods word might there be taught, but that some honour
might be exhibited to the Reliques of Saints, and that foolish people might
there worship dead men. And how pleasant eloquence that Gregorie, called
the great, how feruent, when, as from his three footed stoole, he preached the
maner of consecrating these houses? And a litle after. By this occasion dead
creatures, and bloodles half wormeten bones began to be honored, inuo-
cated, and worshipped with diuine honour. Al which *The Doctors of the Chu ch*
not only winked at, but also *so forward*. Thus the reader seeth, notwith-
