He was also depriued of his prerogatiue in Priesthood, which was after annexed to the Tribe of Leui, wherupon the Chaldee paraphrasis speaketh thus to Ruben: It belonged to thee to haue receiued three better lettes then thy brethren, Priesthood, Best portion, and the Kingdome: But because thou hast sinned, the duble portion is geuen to Ioseph, the Kingdome to Iudas, and Priesthood to Leui.
