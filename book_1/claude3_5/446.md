<sup>4</sup>the wordes of that prophete or dreamer: for the Lord your
God tempteth you, that it may appeare whether you loue him
or no, with al your hart, and with al your soule. <sup>5</sup>Folow the
Lord your God, and feare him, and keepe his commande-
mentes, and heare his voice: him you shal serue, and to him
you shal cleaue. <sup>6</sup>And that prophete or forger of dreames
shal be slaine: because he spake that he might auert you from
the Lord your God, which brought you out of the Land of
Aegypt, and redemed you from the house of seruitude: that
he might make thee to erre from the way, that the Lord thy
God commanded thee: and thou shalt take away the euil
out of the middes of thee. <sup>7</sup>If thy brother the sonne of thy
mother, or thy sonne or daughter, or thy wife that is in thy
bosome, or thy freind, whom thou louest as thy soule, wil
perswade thee secretly, saying: Let vs goe, and serue strange
goddes, which thou knowest not, nor thy fathers, <sup>8</sup>of al
nations round about, that be nigh or farre, from the be-
ginning vnto the end of the earth, <sup>9</sup>consent not to him,
nor heare him, neither let thyne eie spare him to pitie and
hide him, <sup>10</sup>but forthwith thou shalt kil him. let thy
hand be first vpon him, and after thee al the people lay hand
on him. <sup>11</sup>With stones shal he be stoned to death: because
he would haue withdrawen thee from the Lord thy God,
which brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, from the
house of seruitude: <sup>12</sup>that al Israel hearing may feare, and
may doe no more any thing like to this. <sup>13</sup>If in one of thy
cities, which the Lord thy God shal geue thee to inhabite,
thou heare some say: <sup>14</sup>There are gone forth children of
Belial out of the middes of thee, and haue auerted the inha-
bitants of their citie, and haue said: Let vs goe, and serue
strange goddes which you know not: <sup>15</sup>inquire carefully,
and diligently, the truth of the thing being looked into, if
thou finde it certaine that is said, and that this abomination
is in act committed, <sup>16</sup>thou shalt forthwith strike the inha-
bitantes of that citie in the edge of the sworde, and shalt
destroy it and al thinges that are in it, vnto the very beastes.
<sup>17</sup>What stuffe also soeuer there is, thou shalt gather together
in the middes of the streates therof, and shalt burne it with
the citie it selfe, so that thou consume al thinges to the Lord
thy God, and it be a heape for euer: it shal be built no more,
<sup>18</sup>and there shal nothing sticke in thy hand of that anathema:

uat man is not

by this to kil:

is bound to in-

gistrate, and so
by order of
iustice to pro-
cede against
the wicked.
