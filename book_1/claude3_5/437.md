thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of seruitude: <sup>15</sup> and was thy conductor in the huge and terrible wildernesse, wherein was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and :: dipsas, and no waters at al: who brought forth riuers out of the hardest rocke, <sup>16</sup> and fed thee with Manna in the wildernesse, which thy fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proued thee, <sup>17</sup> at the last he had mercie vpon thee, † lest thou shouldest say in thy hart: Myne owne force, and the strength of myne owne hand, haue atchieued al these thinges for me. <sup>18</sup> But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath geuen thee strength, that he might fulfil his couenant, concerning which he sware to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth. <sup>19</sup> But if forgetting the Lord thy God, thou shalt folow strange goddes, and shalt serue and adore them: behold now I foretel thee that thou shalt perish vtterly. <sup>20</sup> As the Nations, which our Lord destroyed at thyne entrie, so shal you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God.
