GENESIS.

<aside>Luthers, of nature, or now written in the law of grace (as Protestantes say there is not) there were no law at al. See more of this point in the Annotations, chap. 7. ad Hebr. Here we only observe that Abel, Seth, Enos, and other Patriarches were Priests, and exercised priestly functions: yea Cain also was a Priest (though a bad one) and offered Sacrifice.</aside>

But external offices or ministerie, without a wel disposed mind, and sincere vertues producing Good workes, did never iustifie anie man. And therfore Cains Sacrifice, offered with a perverse mind, was not respected by God, as Abels was: Wherupon he became worse, and more malicious. God sharply reproved his anger and enuie, conceived without iust cause, saying: If thou doest wel, shalt thou not receiue againe: but if thou doest il, shal not thy sinne forthwith be present at the dore: derly shewing that euerie one shal receiue according to his workes.

This place also evidently sheweth Freewil, yea in a wicked man. For this expostulation had neuer benne vttered, by our most reasonable Lord, and Master, if Cain had benne depriued of freewil. For he might haue excused himselfe, and must nedes haue benne holden excused, if he had benne forced to do evil. But God charged him as inexcusable, and as one that knew, or ought to know, that he had freewil. And doth further inculcate, that he had, and should haue powre, and freewil ouer his concupiscences, to correct the same, if he would, saying: The lust therof shal be vnder thee, and thou shalt haue dominion ouer it. So that no sinner, be he neuer so wicked, much lesse a iust man, lacketh freewil. yet Luther abhorreth the very word, and Calvin wil heith it out of the world.[^1]

Temporal punishment is proued to be due for sinne remitted, by that both death, and other penalties are inflicted, by Gods iustice vpon men, after iustification: as particular punishments laid vpon Adam and Eve, after confessing their faultes.[^2]

Purgatorie is also proued by the same iustice of God. For when anie death penitent, and yet haue not made ful satisfaction, they must suffer for that remaineth after death, and be purged, before they can enter into rest. which remaines of debt our B. Sauiour calleth The last farthing, and saith, it must be payed. The Iewes also at this day hold the doctrine of Purgatorie by tradition. And consequently they Pray for soules departed, not only to God, but also to the ancient Patriarches (which likewise sheweth Inuocation of Saincts) in these wordes: Yee fathers which sleepe in Hebron, open to him the gates of Eden, that is of Paradise, which was planted in Eden. And Hebron is the place where Adam was buried, and his sepulchre religiously conserued in the time of Iosue, aboue 1500 yeares after his death. The same is the place which Abraham bought, and there buried Sara: where also himselfe, and Isaac, and Iacob were buried: and in which finally
