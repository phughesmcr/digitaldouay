the same tribes.

touching the daughters of Salphaad: Let them marrie to
whom they wil, onlie that it be to the men of their owne
tribe: <sup>7</sup> lest the possession of the children of Israel be min-
gled from tribe into tribe. For[^1] al men shal marrie wiues of
their owne tribe and kinred: <sup>8</sup> and al women shal take hus-
bandes of the same tribe: that the inheritance may remaine
in the families, <sup>9</sup> and that the tribes be not mingled among
themselues, but remaine so <sup>10</sup> as they were separated by our
Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad did as it had beene
commanded: <sup>11</sup> and Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and
Melcha, and Noa were married to the sonnes of their vncle
by their father <sup>12</sup> of the familie of Manasses, who was the
sonne of Ioseph: and the possession, that had beene allotted
to them, remained in the tribe and familie of their father.
<sup>13</sup> These are the commandementes and iudgementes, which
our Lord commanded by the hand of Moyses to the children
of Israel, in the champion countries of Moab vpon Iordan
against Iericho.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXXVI.

[^1]: *Distribution of landes*] By reason of two former lawes, the one (*Leuit. 25.*) prouiding that inheritance of landes should not be sold, nor otherwise alie-
nated, but vntil the Iubilee yeare, and then returne to him, or his heyres, to
whom it pertained before; the other (*Num. 27.*) ordaining that for lack of a
sonne, daughters should enherite; this difficultie did rise: in case an enhere-
trix did marrie a man of an other tribe, her landes by that meanes should passe
from tribe to tribe, and not be restored in the Iubilee yeare. For auoiding of
which inconuenience a further law is made, that none shal marrie out of their
owne tribe.

<aside>Al were not bound by this law to marrie, but al that would marrie must contract within their owne tribe.</aside>

Neuerthelesse the tribe of Leui made mariages with the tribe of Iuda: as
appeareth by that Zacharie the priest married Elizabeth cosin to our B. Ladie
of the tribe of Iuda; though in the old Testament there is no such expresse di-
spensation, nor explication of the law, but by tradition was holden for lawful
and practised by so holie a man as Zacharie. And not without mysterie (as S.
Augustin noteth *li. 2. c. 2 de consen. Euang.*) for that Christ the Annointed of God,
was prefigured by the annointing of Kings, and Priestes, and borne of the royal
and priestlie tribes, being both a King and a Priest.

[^2]: Restraint in Mariages also for a temporal cause.

[^3]: Tradition

[^4]: Christ a King and a Priest.
