<sup>1</sup>And our Lord spake unto Moyses, saying: <sup>2</sup>Speake to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Man, or woman, when they shal make a vow to be sanctified, and wil consecrate them selues to the Lord: <sup>3</sup>they shal absteine from wine, & euerie thing, that can make one drunke, vineger of wine, and of any other potion, and whatsoeuer is pressed out of the grape, they shal not drinke: new grapes and drie they shal not eate <sup>4</sup>al the daies wherin they are by vow consecrated to the Lord: whatsoeuer may be of the vineyard, from the reisen to the kernel they shal not eate. <sup>5</sup>Al the time of his separation a rasour shal not passe ouer his head vntil the day be expired, that he is consecrated to the Lord.
