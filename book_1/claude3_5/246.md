<sup>21</sup> my name is in him. But if thou wilt heare his voice, and doe al that I speake, I wil be enemie to thyne enemies, & wil afflict them that afflict thee. <sup>23</sup> And myne Angel shal goe before thee, and shal bring thee in vnto the Amorrheite, and Hetheite, and Pherezeite, and Chananeite, and Heueite, and Iebuzeite, whom I wil destroy. <sup>24</sup> Thou shalt not adore their goddes, nor serue them. Thou shalt not doe their workes, but shalt destroy them, and breake their statues. <sup>25</sup> And you shal serue the Lord your God, that I may blesse your bread & waters, and may take away infirmitie from the middes of thee. <sup>26</sup> There shal not be a fruitlessene nor barren bodie in thy land: I wil fil the number of thy dayes. <sup>27</sup> I wil send my terrour to runne before thee, and wil kil al people, to whom thou shalt enter: and wil turne the backes of al thyne enemies before thee: <sup>28</sup> sending forth hornets before, that shal chase away the Heueite, and Chananeite, and Hetheite, before thou enter. <sup>29</sup> I wil not cast them out from thy face in one yeare: lest the land be brought into a wildernesse, and beastes encrease against thee. <sup>30</sup> By litle and litle I wil expel them from thy sight, til thou be increased, and dost possesse the Land. <sup>31</sup> And I wil sette thy boundes from the Redde sea vnto the sea of the Palestines, and from the desert vnto the riuer: I wil deliuer the inhabitantes of the Land in your handes, and wil cast them out from your sight. <sup>32</sup> Thou shalt not enter league with them, nor with their goddes. <sup>33</sup> Let them not dwel in thy land, lest perhapes they make thee to sinne against me, if thou serue their goddes: which vndoubtedly wil be a scandal to thee.
