cent bloud be not shed in the middes of the Land, which
our Lord thy God wil geue thee to possesse, lest thou be guiltie
<sup>11</sup> of bloud. But if any man hating his neighbour, lie in wayte
for his life, and rise and strike him, and he die, and he flee to
<sup>12</sup> one of the cities aforesaid, the ancientes of his citie shal
send, and take him out of the place of refuge, and shal deliuer
him into the hand of the kinseman of him, whose bloud was
<sup>13</sup> shed, and he shal die. Thou shalt not pitie him, and thou
shalt take away the guiltie bloud out of Israel, that it may be
<sup>14</sup> wel with thee. Thou shalt not take, and transferre thy
neighbours boundes, which thy predecessours did sette in
thy possession, which our Lord thy God wil geue thee in the
<sup>15</sup> Land, that thou shalt receiue to possesse. One witnesse
shal not stand against any man, whatsoeuer sinne, or wickedness it be: but in the mouth of two or three witnesses shal
<sup>16</sup> euerie word stand. If a lying witnesse stand against a man,
<sup>17</sup> accusing him of preuarication, both of them, whose the
<sup>18</sup> cause is, shal stand before our Lord in the sight of the priestes
and the iudges that shal be in those daies. And when searching most diligently, they shal finde that the false witnes
<sup>19</sup> hath said a lie against his brother: they shal render to him
as he meant to doe to his brother, and thou shalt take away
<sup>20</sup> the euil out of the middes of thee: that others hearing
may haue feare, and may not be bold to doe such things.
<sup>21</sup> Thou shalt not pitie him, but life for life, eie for eie,
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foote for foote shalt thou
exacte.
