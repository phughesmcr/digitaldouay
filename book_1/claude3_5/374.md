<sup>15</sup> There shal be al one precept and iudgement as wel to your selues as to the strangers of the land. <sup>16</sup> Our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>17</sup> Speake to the children of Israel: and thou shalt say to them: <sup>18</sup> When you are come into the land, which I wil geue you, <sup>19</sup> and shal eate of the breades of that countrie, you shal separate first fruites to the Lord <sup>20</sup> of your meates. As of your barne floores you separate first-fruites, <sup>21</sup> so of your pastes shal you geue first fruites to the Lord. <sup>22</sup> And if through ignorance you omitte any of these thinges, which the Lord hath spoken to Moyses, <sup>23</sup> and by him hath commanded you, from the day that he beganne to command and so forward, <sup>24</sup> and the multitude haue forgotten to do it: they shal offer a calfe out of the heard, an holocauste for a most sweete sauour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libamentes therof, as the ceremonies require, and a buckegoate for sinne: <sup>25</sup> and the priest shal pray for al the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shal be forgeuen them, because they sinned not wittingly, offering notwithstanding burnt sacrifice to the Lord for them selues and for their sinne and errour: <sup>26</sup> and it shal be forgeuen al the people of the children of Israel, and the strangers, that seiourne among them: because it is the fault of al the people through ignorance. <sup>27</sup> But if one soule shal sinne vnwitting, he shal offer a she goate of a yeare old for his sinne: <sup>28</sup> and the priest shal pray for him, because he sinned vnwitting before the Lord: and he shal obteine him pardon, and it shal be forgeuen him. <sup>29</sup> As wel to them that are borne in the countrie as to the strangers one law shal be for al, that sinne by ignorance. <sup>30</sup> But the soule, that through pride committeth any thing, whether he be borne in the countrie, or a stranger, (because he hath bene rebellious against the Lord) shal perish out of his people: <sup>31</sup> for he hath contemned the word of the Lord, and made his precept of no effect: therfore shal he be destroyed, and shal beare his iniquitie. <sup>32</sup> And it came to passe, when the children of Israel were in the wildernesse, and had found a man gathering stickes on the Sabbath day, <sup>33</sup> they presented him to Moyses and Aaron and the whole multitude. <sup>34</sup> Who shut him into prison, not knowing what they should doe with him. <sup>35</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Dying let this man die, let al the multitude stone him without the campe. <sup>36</sup> And when they had brought him out, they stoned him,

<aside>Though sinnes wittingly committed, proceede of pride and contempt of Gods commandment, could not be pardoned by the law: yet such may also be remitted through true repentance. S. Aug. q. 25. in Num.</aside>
