<sup>15</sup> eate of the corne, vntil the day that you offer therof to your God. It is a precept for euer in your generations, and al your habitations. <sup>16</sup> You shal number therfore from the morow after the Sabbath, wherin you did offer the sheafe of the first fruites, seuen ful weekes, <sup>17</sup> vnto the morow after the seuenth weeke be expired, that is to say fiftie daies, and so you shal offer a new sacrifice to the Lord. <sup>18</sup> out of al your habitations, two loaues of first fruites, of two tenthes of floure leauened, the which you shal bake for the first fruites of the Lord. <sup>19</sup> And you shal offer with the breades seuen lambes without spotte of a yeare old, and one calfe from the heard, and two rammes, and they shal be for an holocaust with their libamentes, for a most sweete odour to the Lord. <sup>20</sup> You shal make a bucke goate also for sinne, and two lambes of a yeare old for hostes of pacifiques. <sup>21</sup> And when the priest hath eleuated them with the breades of the first fruites before the Lord, they shal turne to his vse. <sup>22</sup> And you shal cal this day most solemne, and most holie: no seruile worke shal you doe in it. It shal be an euerlasting ordinance in al your habitations, and generations. <sup>23</sup> And after you reape the corne of your land, you shal not cut it to the verie ground: neither shal you gather the eares that remaine, but you shal let them alone for the poore and for strangers. I am the Lord your God. <sup>24</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>25</sup> Speake to the children of Israel: The seuenth moneth, on the first day of the moneth, shal be a Sabbath, a memorial, by sounding of trumpetes, and shal be called holie: <sup>26</sup> no seruile worke shal you doe in it, and you shal offer holocaust to the Lord. <sup>27</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>28</sup> vpon the tenth day of this seuenth moneth shal be the day of expiations most solemne, and it shal be called holie: and you shal afflict your soules in it, and shal offer holocaust to the Lord. <sup>29</sup> No seruile worke shal you doe the time of this day: because it is a day of propitiation, that the Lord your God may become propitious vnto you. <sup>30</sup> Euerie soule, that is not afflicted this day, shal perish out of his people: <sup>31</sup> and which shal doe anie worke, the same wil I destroy out of his people. <sup>32</sup> No worke therfore shal you doe in it: it shal be an euerlasting odinance vnto you in al your generations, and habitations. It is a Sabbath of resting, and you shal afflict your soules the ninth day of the moneth:
