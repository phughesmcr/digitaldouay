GENESIS.

Seuen eares of corne grew forth vpon one stalke ful and but Ioseph?

<sup>6</sup> faire: there sprang also other eares as many, thinne and [^1]

<sup>7</sup> blasted with adustion, deuouring al the beautie of the

<sup>8</sup> former. Pharao awaking, yet after his rest, and when

morning was come, being frighted with feare, he sent to al

the interpreters of Ægypt, and to al the wise men: and they

being called for, told them his dreames, neither was there anie

<sup>9</sup> that could interprete it. Then at length the maister of the

<sup>10</sup> cupbearers remembring himselfe, said: I confesse my sinne:

The king being angrie with his seruantes, commanded

me and the chiefe of the bakers to be cast into the prison

<sup>11</sup> of the captaine of the souldiers: where in one night both

<sup>12</sup> of vs saw a dreame portending things to come. There

<sup>13</sup> was there a young man an hebrew, seruant to the same captaine of the souldiers: to whom telling our dreames, we

heard whatsoeuer afterward the euent of the thing proued

to be so. for I was restored to my office: and he was hanged

<sup>14</sup> vpon a gibbet. Forthwith at the kinges commandment,

Ioseph being brought out of the prison they polled him:

<sup>15</sup> and changing his apparel, brought him vnto him. To

whom he said: I haue seene dreames, and there is not anie

that can expound them: which I haue heard, thou doest

<sup>16</sup> most wisely interprete. Ioseph answered: Without me,

<sup>17</sup> God wil answere prosperous thinges to Pharao. Pharao

therfore told that he had seene: Me thought I stoode vpon

<sup>18</sup> the banke of the riuer, and seuen kine came vp out of

the banke of the riuer, exceeding faire, and ful of flesh:

<sup>19</sup> which grazed on greene places in a marish pasture. And

behold, there folowed these, other seuen kine, so passing

il sauored and leane, that I neuer saw the like in the land

<sup>20</sup> of Ægypt, which hauing deuoured and consumed the

<sup>21</sup> former, gaue no token of their fulnes: but with the like

leannesse and filthines, looked heauilie. Awaking, and

<sup>22</sup> fallen againe into a deepe sleepe, I sawe a dreame: Seuen eares of corne grew forth vpon one stalke, ful and verie

<sup>23</sup> faire. Other seuen also thinne and blasted, with adu-

<sup>24</sup> stion, sprang of the stalke: which deuoured the beautie

<sup>25</sup> of the former: I told the dreame to the coniecturers, and

there is no man that can declare it. Ioseph answered: [^2]

The kinges dreame is one: God hath shewed to Pharao

<sup>26</sup> the thinges that he wil doe. The seuen faire kine, and

[^1]: who had ther wit to interpret them. S. Aug. li. 12. c. 9. de Gen. ad lit. S. Greg. li. 21. Moral in c. 28. Iob.
