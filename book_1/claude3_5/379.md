CHAP. XVII.

*Moyses taking of the princes of twelue tribes twelue roddes, and one of Aaron for the tribe of Leui, layeth them al in the tabernacle at night, 8. Where Aarons rodde (and none of the rest) buddeth, bloometh, and bringeth forth fruite, 9. And al being shewed to the people, Aarons is caried back, and kept for a monument in the tabernacle.*

<sup>1</sup> AND our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>2</sup> Speake to the children of Israel, and take a rodde of euerie one of their kinredes, of al the princes of their tribes, twelue roddes, and the name of euerie one thou shalt write vpon his rodde. <sup>3</sup> and the name of Aaron shal be in the tribe of Leui, <sup>4</sup> and one rodde shal conteine al their families: and thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of couenant before the testimonie, where I wil speake to thee. <sup>5</sup> Whomsoever of these I shal choose, his rodde shal blossome: and I shal stay from me the grudginges of the children of Israel, wherwith they murmur against you. <sup>6</sup> And Moyses spake to the children of Israel: and al the princes gaue him roddes by euerie tribe: and they were twelue roddes besides Aarons rodde. <sup>7</sup> Which when Moyses had laid before our Lord in the tabernacle of testimonie: <sup>8</sup> returning the day folowing he found that Aarons rodde in the house of Leui was budded: and the buddes therof swelling, the blossomes were shotte forth, which spredding the leaues, were fashioned into almondes. <sup>9</sup> Moyses therfore brought forth al the roddes from the sight of our Lord to al the children of Israel: and they saw and euerie one receiued their roddes. <sup>10</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: Carie backe Aarons rodde into the tabernacle of testimonie, that it may be kept there for a signe of the rebellious children of Israel, and let their complaintes cease from me, lest they die. <sup>11</sup> And Moyses did as our Lord had commanded. <sup>12</sup> And the children of Israel said to Moyses: Behold we are consumed, we are al perished. <sup>13</sup> Whosoeuer approcheth to the tabernacle of our Lord, he dieth. Are we al to be destroyed vnto vtter consumption?

[^1]: For more satisfaction to the whole people God confirmeth Aarons authoritie by a new miracle. v. 10.

[^2]: The rodde signified the B. Virgin mother: and the almondes Christ, to wit, the vtter pill his humanitie, the shel his crosse, the kernel his diuinitie: Who pacified by the blood of his crosse, al thinges in earth and in heauen. Coloss. 1. S. Aug. ser. 3. de temp.
