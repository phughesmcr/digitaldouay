<aside>Special place of burial lawfully desired, and spiritually profitable.</aside>

30. *I wil sleepe with my fathers*] Albeit neither the lack of burial, nor anie crueltie nor contumelie vsed against dead bodies, can annoy the soul, for *those that men killed, can after no more harme*: yet it is both a lawful natural desire, and a spiritual comfort and profit, to be buried in special places, where their owne frends, or holie persons are buried, or where God is more specially served, Sacrifices, and other prayers offered. And so both Iacob and Ioseph desired to rest in the land of Chanaan, where their parents were buried and where Christ should be borne and redeeme mankind. But worldlie pompe and honour of funerals, are rather the comfort of the liuing, then the reliefe of the departed, as S. Augustin teacheth, in Psal. 115. For in the sight of men, the poore Lazarus (faith the same S. Augustin lib. 1. c. 13. de ciuit.) made solemne and glorious exequies to the rich glutton, that was cloathed in silk, and fared delicately in his life, but in the sight of God, the Angels ministerie made far more excellent to poore Lazarus, though they caried not his bodie into a marble tombe, but his soule into Abrahams bosome.

<aside>But pompe auaileth not the dead.</aside>

31. *To the bed's head.*] S. Paul alleaging this place saith: *Iacob adored the top of Ioseph's rod*,[^1] following the Septuagint, who for the same Hebrew word (being without points, that is, without vowels) in this place say, *rod*, and in the next chapter (v. 2.) interprete *bed*. For *Mateh* signifieth a *rod*, and *Mittah*, *a bed*. The Latin text therefore is pointed, and the Septuagint, and S. Paules reading *rod*, both are true, and both together expresse the whole action, that Iacob taking Iosephs rod into his hand, and leaning on the top of it, adored not only God, the Lord and geuer of al good, but also his sonne Ioseph now the chiefe ruler and Prince of Egypt, as S. Augustin expoundeth. li. 16. c. 37. in Gen. And herein saith S. Chrisostom (ho. 66) Iosephs dreame was fulfilled: that the sunne and moone should adore him. The like saith Theodoret (q. 108. in Gen.) And Procopius addeth that Iacob adoring Iosephs rod, adored also Christs kingdome, prefigured by the same rod. But how adoration of creatures redoundeth to the honour of God, more is noted vpon the said place of S. Paul. Heb. 11.

<aside>The Septuagint contrarie to the Hebrew and Latin text, but supplie that was omitted.</aside>

<aside>Adoration of God and creatures is not repugnant.</aside>

[^1]: Heb. 11.

CHAP. XLVIII.

*Ioseph visiteth his father being sick. 5. Who adopteth his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim, 13. and blesseth them, preferring the younger before the elder, contrarie to Iosephs mind. 22. And geueth a portion of land to Ioseph, aboue his brethren.*

THESE things being so done, it was told Ioseph that his father was sicke: who, taking his two sonnes Manasses and Ephraim, went forward. <sup>2</sup>And it was told the old man: Behold thy sonne Ioseph cometh to thee. Who being strengthned sate on his bed. <sup>3</sup>And Ioseph being entred in to him, he said: God almightie appeared to me in Luza, which is in the Land of Chanaan: and he blessed me, <sup>4</sup>and sayd: I wil increase, and multiplie thee, and make thee into multitudes
