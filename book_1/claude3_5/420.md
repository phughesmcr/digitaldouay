your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, that he would geue
it to them, and to their seede after them. <sup>9</sup>And I said to
you at that time: I alone can not susteyne you: because <sup>10</sup>
the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day
as the starres of heauen, verie manie. <sup>11</sup>(The Lord God of
your fathers adde to this number manie thousandes, and
blesse you as he hath spoken.) <sup>12</sup>I alone am not able to su-
steyne your businesses, and the charge of you and your qua-
rels. <sup>13</sup>Geue from among you wise and skilful men, and
such whose conuersation is approued in your tribes, that I
may appoint them your princes. <sup>14</sup>Then you answered
me: The thing is good which thou meanest to do. <sup>15</sup>And
I tooke of your tribes men wise and noble, and appointed
them princes, tribunes, and centurions, and quinquagena-
rians, and deanes, that might teach you al thinges. <sup>16</sup>And
I commanded them, saying: Heare them, and iudge that
which is iust: whether he be the same countrie man, or a
stranger. <sup>17</sup>There shal be no difference of persons, so shal you
heare the litle as the great: neither shal you accept any mans
person, because it is the iudgement of God. And if any thing
seme hard to you, referre it to me, and I wil heare it. <sup>18</sup>And
I commanded al thinges that you ought to do. <sup>19</sup>And depar-
ting from Horeb, we passed through the terrible and huge
wildernesse, which you saw, by the way of the mountaine of
the Amorrheite, as the Lord our God had commanded vs.
And when we were come into Cadesbarne, <sup>20</sup>I said to you:
You are come to the mountaine of the Amorrheite, which
the Lord our God wil geue to vs. <sup>21</sup>See the Land which the
Lord thy God geueth thee: goe vp and possesse it, as the Lord
our God hath spoken to thy fathers: feare not, neither dread
you any thing. <sup>22</sup>And you came al vnto me, and said: Let vs
send men that may view the Land: and may bring vs word
what way we shal ascend, and to what cities to goe. <sup>23</sup>And
because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelue men, one
of euerie tribe. <sup>24</sup>Who when they had gone, and were as-
cended into the mountaines, they came as farre as the Valley
of cluster: and the Land being viewed, <sup>25</sup>taking of the frui-
tes therof, to shew the fruitfulnesse, they brought vnto vs,
and said: The Land is good, which the Lord our God wil
geue vs. <sup>26</sup>And you would not goe vp, but being incredulous
at the word of the Lord our God, <sup>27</sup>you murmured in your
tabernacles,
