Sabbath, that is, the rest of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not doe any worke therin, thou, and thy sonne and daughter, man seruant and woman seruant, and oxe, and asse, and al thy cattel, and the stranger that is within thy gates: that thy man seruant may rest, and thy woman seruant, euen as thy selfe. <sup>15</sup> Remember that thou also didest serue in Ã†gypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence in a strong hand, and stretched out arme. Therfore hath he com<sup>16</sup>manded thee that thou shouldest obserue the Sabbath. <sup>Ho</sup>nour thy father and mother, as our Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that thou mayst liue a long time, and it may be wel with thee in the Land, which the Lord thy God wil geue <sup>17</sup>thee. <sup>18</sup>Thou shalt not murder. <sup>Neither shalt thou</sup> <sup>19</sup>committe aduoutrie. <sup>And thou shal not steale. <sup>Neither</sup> shalt thou speake against thy neighbour false testimonie. <sup>20</sup>Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife: :: Nor house, nor field, nor man seruant, nor woman seruant, nor oxe, <sup>21</sup>nor asse, and al thinges that are his. <sup>These wordes spake our Lord to al your multitude in the mount, out of the middes of the fire and the cloude, and the darkenes, with a loude voice, adding nothing more: and he wrote them in the two <sup>23</sup>tables of stone, which he deliuered vnto me. <sup>And you,</sup> after you heard the voice out of the middes of the darkenes, and saw the mount burne, came to me al the princes of the <sup>24</sup>tribes and the elders, and you said: <sup>Behold the Lord our God hath shewed vs his maiestie and greatnes, for we haue heard his voice out of the middes of the fire, and haue proued <sup>25</sup>this day that God speaking with man, man hath liued. <sup>Why</sup> shal we die therfore, and this exceding great fire deuoure vs? For if we heare the voice of the Lord our God any <sup>26</sup>more, we shal die. <sup>What is al flesh, that it should heare the voice of the liuing God, who speaketh out of the middes <sup>27</sup>of the fire as we haue heard, and may liue? <sup>Approche</sup> thou rather: and heare al thinges that the Lord our God shal say to thee: and thou shalt speake to vs, and we hearing wil <sup>28</sup>doe them. <sup>Which when our Lord had heard, he said to me:</sup> I haue heard the voice of the wordes of this people, which <sup>29</sup>they spake to thee: they haue spoken al thinges wel. <sup>Who</sup> shal geue them to haue such a minde, that they would feare me, and keepe al my commandementes at al time, that it may be wel with them and with their children for euer?

<aside>Coueting an other mans wife, and coueting his goodes, differ as much, as the exterior actes of adultery and of theft. And so these two commandmentes are distinct as the former two.</aside>
