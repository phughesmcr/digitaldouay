standing their lies, scoffes, and blasphemies, Protestants do confesse, that the Church and her chiefe pillers, straight after the first hundred yeares of Christ, fiue hundred next folowing, honored Saincts and their Reliques. Neither want there authentical examples of holie Scriptures, wherby the same is proued. <sup>31</sup>*Gen. 32. 48. Exodi. 3. 32. Num. 22. Iosue 5. 3. Reg. 18. 4. Reg. 2. Psalm. 98. and els where.*

<aside>Protestants haue corrupted the text in al their English Bibles.</aside>

<sup>â€ </sup> A grauen thing ] Here the same falsifiers of Christian doctrin, do not only peruert the sense of holie Scripture, wrestling that against Images, which is spoken against Idols, but also shamefully corrupt the text, by translating *grauen image*, neither folowing the Hebrew, Greke, nor Latin. For the Hebrew word, *pesel*, is the verie same that *sculptile* in Latin, that is *a grauen or carued thing*. The Greke hath *eidolon*, *an idol*. So al Protestants English Bibles are false. In the meane time til they correct their bookes, they may please to remember, that God shortly after this (Exod. 25.) commanded to make Images of Angels, to wit Cherubins. Likewise a brasen serpent (Num. 21.) Also oxen and Lions (3. Reg. 6. & 7.) Neither are Puritanes so precise, but that they engraue, carue, print, paint, cast, sow, embrother, and otherwise make; and kepe Images, pourtraitures, and pictures of men, and other thinges. As for worshipping of sacred Images the second concel of Nice (Act. 4.) The concel of Trent (sess. 25.) S. Gregorie the great (li. 7. ep. 5. & 53) S. Damascen in diuers whole bookes, and manie others, and al Catholique Catechismes and Christian Instructions teach, that the honour is not done to the Image for it self, but at the presence of the Image, to Christ, or Saincts, whose Image it is.

<aside>God commanded to make Images.</aside>

<aside>Christ, and Saincts are honored in their Images.</aside>

An other controuersie Caluinists here maketh, that from these wordes, *Thou shalt not make*, beginneth the second precept, so counting foure precepts in the first table, and six in the second. But being no matter of faith, how they are diuided, so al the wordes, and the number of tenne commandements be acknowledged (for holie Scripture calleth them tenne, Exo 34. v. 28. Deute. 4. v. 13. & 10. v. 4.) we wil not contend: but only as more reasonable we folow the common maner of diuiding the first table into three precepts, directing vs to God, the second into seuen, belonging to our neighbour, approued for the better by S. Augustin (q. 71 in Exodum) and generally receiued of al Catholiques; grounded vpon this reason, among others, because to make or haue a picture, or similitude of anie creature, to the end to adore it as God, were in deede to haue a strange God; which is forbid in the first wordes: and so al that foloweth to the comination and promise, forbiddeth false goddes, and appeareth to be but one precept in substance. But the desire and internal consent to adultrie, and to theft, differ altogether as much, as the external actes of the same sinnes; and therfore seing adultrie and theft are forbidden to be comitted, by two distinct precepts, the prohibition of the internal desire, with mental consent to the same, doth also require two precepts.

<aside>The first table containeth three precepts the second seuen.</aside>

<aside>The first can not wel be diuided.</aside>

<aside>The ninth and tenth are as distinct, as the sixth and seuenth.</aside>
