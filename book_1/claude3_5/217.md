whereof there is no number, (c. 9.) *And that with termes appropriated to the three diuine Persons* (c. 26.) In his strength sodainly the seas are gathered togeather, and with his wisedom he stroke the proud man. His Spirite hath adorned the heauens. *The same Mysterie of pluralitie of Persons in one God is more clere by the Hebrew text chap. 30. v. 11. and 35. v. 10. Where the same actions are ascribed to God, as to one, and as to manie.*

But most euident are the promises, figures, and prophecies of Christ our Redemer. For besides present abundance of riches, promise of great progenie, and that the same should possesse the fruitful Land of Chanaan (three special blessings of the old Testament) God promised Abraham a farre greater thing (Gen. 11.) that in his seede al nations and kindreds of the earth should be blessed. *In confirmation whereof, God also changed his name* Abram (high or noble father) into Abraham (Father of manie nations, Gen. 17. *And so he was natural father of foure great Kingdomes, Ismaelites, Madianites, Idumeans, and Israelites: but spiritual father of manie more, to wit, of al that beleue in Christ, Iewes and Gentiles, from that time to the worlds end.* The same promises of possessing Chanaan and of Christ were renewed and confirmed to Isaac (Gen.26.) in like sorte to Iacob (28.) *for they pertained not to Ismael, nor to the other sonnes of Abraham, nor to Esau.* Moreouer Christ, our Redemer and deliuerer from sinne, and captiuitie of the diuel, was prefigured by Abraham, at last deliuering those from captiuitie, who otherwise endeuering to shake of the yoke of Cordorlaomor, fel further into subiection and bondage (Gen. 14.) *Also Melchisedech, King and Priest, of vnknowen generation, extraordinarie vocation, without predecessor, or successor, prefigured Christ King and Priest for euer, who not by successors, but by Priests his vicars, perpetually exerciseth al Priestlie functions.* Likewise Isaac borne aboue the common course of nature (Gen. 21) singularly beloued of his father, carying wood on his back for the sacrificing of himselfe (22.) Iacob flying his brother Esau (27.) hardly treated by Laban, (31.) yet alwayes inuincible against his aduersaries, (32.) Ioseph hated of his brethren, sold and deliuered to Gentiles, (37.) by them also persecuted, (39.) but afterwardes aduanced, and called the Sauiour of the world, (41.) Iust Iob vehemently afflicted; Moyses hidden for a while, then exposed to danger, and thence deliuered: afterwards manifesting him selfe to his brethren, by them reiected, betrayed, and flying from Pharao (Exo. 2.) returning againe (Exod. 3. 4. &c.) and at last deliuering the Israelites from bondage of Egypt (Exo 14.) And manie other things, as the ramme sacrificed in place of Isaac (Gen. 22.) the ladder of Iacob (Gen 28.) Iosephs scepter (47.) Aarons rodde (Exo. 7.) Paschal lambe (12.) prefigured Christ, borne of a Virgin; the onlie Sonne of God; sometimes hidden, other
