dust upon al the Land of Egypt: for there shal be in men,
and beastes :: boyles, and swelling bladders in the whole land
of Egypt. <sup>10</sup> And they tooke ashes out of the chimney, and
stoode before Pharao, and Moyses sprinkled it into the ayre:
and there were made boyles of swelling bladders in men and
beastes. <sup>11</sup> :: neither could the enchanters stand before
Moyses for boyles that were upon them, and in al the Land
of Egypt. <sup>12</sup> And our Lord did indurate Pharaoes hart, &
he heard them not, as our Lord spake to Moyses. <sup>13</sup> And our
Lord said to Moyses: In the morning arise, and stand before
Pharao, & thou shalt say to him : This saith the Lord, the
God of the Hebrewes: Dismisse my people to sacrifice unto
me. <sup>14</sup> Because this time I wil send al my plagues upon thy
hart, and upon thy servantes, and upon thy people: that
thou mayest know there is not the like to me in al the earth.
<sup>15</sup> For now stretching forth my hand I wil strike thee, and
thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt perish from the
earth. <sup>16</sup> And therfore :: have I set thee, that in thee I may

beastes, and al thinges that shal be found abroad, and not ga-

them, shal die. <sup>20</sup> He that feared the word of our Lord of
Pharaoes servantes, made his servantes to flie, and his beastes
into houses: <sup>21</sup> but he that neglected the word of our Lord,
let alone his servantes, and his beastes in the fieldes. <sup>22</sup> And
our Lord said to Moyses: Stretch forth thy hand towards
heaven, that there may be haile in the whole Land of Egypt
upon men, and upon beastes, & upon everie herbe of the
field in the Land of Egypt. <sup>23</sup> And Moyses stretched forth his
rodde toward heaven, and our Lord gaue thunders, and haile
and running lightenings on the land: and our Lord rained
haile upon the Land of Egypt. <sup>24</sup> And the haile and fire mixt
together did driue: and it was of so great bignes, as neuer be-
