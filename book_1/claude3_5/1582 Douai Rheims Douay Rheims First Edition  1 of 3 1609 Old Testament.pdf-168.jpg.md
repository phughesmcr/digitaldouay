<sup>5</sup>Simeon and Levi brethren: "vessels of iniquitie warring. <sup>6</sup>Into their counsel come not my soule, and in their congregation be not my glorie: because in their furie they slew a man, and in their wilfulnes they vndermined a wall. <sup>7</sup>Cursed be their furie, because it is stubborne: and their indignation, because it is hard: I wil divide them in Iacob, and wil disperse them in Israel.

<sup>8</sup>Iudas, thee thy brethren shal praise: thy hand shalbe in the neck of thyne enemies: thy fathers children shal adore thee. <sup>9</sup>A lions whelp Iudas: to the pray my sonne thou didst ascend: resting thou didst lye as a lion, and as it were a lyonesse, who shal raise him vp? <sup>10</sup>"The scepter shal not BE TAKEN away from Iudas, and a duke out of his thigh, til he doe come that is to be sent, and the same shal be the expectation of the gentiles <sup>11</sup>Tying to the vineyard his colt, and to the vine, o my sonne, his she asse." He shal wash his stole in wine, and in the bloud of the grape his cloke. <sup>12</sup>His eyes are more beautiful then wine, and his teeth whiter then milke.

Other things he foresheweth pertayning to the diuision of the Land of Chanaan, others to the times of the Iudges, of the Kings, of the Captiuitie, of Deliuerie from thence, of Christ, of Antichrist, and of the end of this world. Of al which diuers anciet fathers haue written large c≈çmentaries, & godlie treatises.</aside>
