<sup>6</sup> Speake to the children of Israel: man, or woman, when they shal do any of al the sinnes, that are wont to chance to men, and by negligence haue transgressed the commandement of the Lord, and haue offended, <sup>7</sup> they shal confesse their sinne, and restore the principal it self, and the fifth part ouer to him, against whom they sinned. <sup>8</sup> But if there be none to receiue it, they shal geue it to the Lord, and it shal be the priestes, the ramme excepted, that is offered for expiation, to be a placable hoste. <sup>9</sup> Al the first fruites also, which the children of Israel doe offer, pertaine to the priest: <sup>10</sup> and whatsoeuer is offered into the Sanctuarie of euerie one, and is deliuered to the handes of the priest, it shal be his. <sup>11</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>12</sup> Speake to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man, whose wife erreth, and contemning her husband <sup>13</sup> hath slept with an other man, and her husband could not find it, but the adulterie is secrete, and can not be proued by witnesses, because she was not found in the adulterous fact: <sup>14</sup> if the spirit of ielosie stirre vp the husband against his wife, which either is polluted, or is charged with false suspition, <sup>15</sup> he shal bring her to the priest, and shal offer an oblation for her the tenth part of a satum of barley meale: he shal not powre oile theron, nor put frankincense vpon it: because it is a sacrifice of ielosie, and an oblation searching out adulterie. <sup>16</sup> The priest therefore shal offer it, and set it before the Lord. <sup>17</sup> And he shal take holie water in an earthen vessel, and he shal cast a litle grauel of the pauement of the tabernacle into it. <sup>18</sup> And when the woman shal stand in the sight of the Lord, he shal vncouer her head, and shal put vpon her handes the sacrifice of recordation, and the oblation of ielosie: and him selfe shal hold the most bitter waters, wheron he heaped curses with execration. <sup>19</sup> and he shal adiure her, and shal say: If an other man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not polluted by forsaking thy husbandes bedde, these most bitter waters shal not hurt thee, wherupon I haue heaped curses. <sup>20</sup> But if thou hast declined from thy husband, & art polluted, and hast lien with an other man: <sup>21</sup> thou shalt be subiect to these maledictions: Our Lord geue thee for a malediction,
