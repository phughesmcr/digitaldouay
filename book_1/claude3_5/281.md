# THE ARGVMENT OF LEVITICVS.

<hr>

WHEN the Tabernacle was erected, nere to Mount Sinai, the first day of the second yeare, after the children of Israel parted from Ã†gypt, and was so replenished with Gods Maiestie, that not Moyses himself could enter in, our Lord speaking from thence, called Moyses, and declared to him the offices of the Leuites: whom only, and no others, he deputed for the administration, and charge of sacred things: wherof this booke (wherin they are written) is called Leuiticus. In which saith S. Hierom, al and euerie Sacrifice, yea almost euerie sillable, and Aarons vestments, and the whole Leuitical order breath forth heauenlie sacraments, or mysteries. For first God here prescribeth what sacrifices he wil haue, in what manner, and to what purposes. Then what partes and qualities he requireth in Priests; how they shal be vested and consecrated, seuerely punishing some that transgressed: with commandment neither to offer in sacrifice, nor to eat: things reputed vncleane, and the maner of purifying such things, and persons, as by diuers occasions were polluted: Interposing also some moral, and iudicial precepts; appointeth certaine solemne feastes, times of rest, and iubilie yeares. Finally promiseth rewardes, and threatneth punishments to those that keepe or breake his commandments: with particular admonition touching vowes and tithes. So this booke may be diuided into fiue special partes. The first, of diuers sortes of Sacrifices: in the seuen first chapters. The second, of consecrating Priests, and their vestments, with punishment for offering strange fire, in the three next chapters. The third, of distinction betwen cleane and vncleane, with the maner of purifying certaine legal vncleanes, and other precepts moral and iudicial, from the 11. chap. to the 23. The fourth, of feasts, times of rest, and iubilie with priuiledges, rewardes, and punishments. from the 23. chap. to the 27. The fifth, of vowes, and tithes, in the last chapter.
