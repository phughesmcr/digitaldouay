<aside>External Sacrifice due to God in euerie Law.</aside>

iection to his diuine Maiestie. And that not only in internal affection; which (as S. Augustin, and al Catholique Doctors teach) is principally required, but also in external things, because we consist of bodie, and not only of soule, and haue, by Gods goodnes, the vse of corporal things. As here we see example in the law of nature: and the same was ordained by written precept in the law of Moyses: the Patriarches also foretold, that external Sacrifice should be offered in the law of grace, and new Testament, to wit, the same which Christ instituted, and left in his Church, to continew to the end of the world. Moreouer this homage of offering Sacrifice is so peculiar to God only, that al-

<aside>Sacrifice due to God onlie, and to no creature.</aside>

beit manie other exterior rites and seruices are vsed both to God & men, as to bow, to kneele, & the like before them, *either of ciuil humilitie* (saith S. Augustin) *or of flattering adulation, to such as are homines colendi, vene-randi, si multum ei antecellunt, adorandi: men to be worshipped, reuerenced and if much be geuen them, adored* (for this terme of *adoring* is also applied to men in holie Scriptures Gen. 27. v. 29. 1. Reg. 25.) yet Sacrifice is due to God only, and to no creature how excellent soeuer. In so much (saith the same Doctor) that as al nations founde it necessarie to offer Sacrifice, so none durst sacrifice *to anie nisi, quem Deum aut sciuit, aut putauit, aut finxit:* but to him whom they either knew, or thought, or fained to be God.

4. *Iisdem rebus* [^1] Both Cain and Abel did wel in offering external Sacrifice, but they differed much in sinceritie and maner of choosing or diuiding their oblations, touching Gods part and their owne, as S. Iustinus Martyr, S. Hierom, S. Augustin and others teach. For Abel offered of the best things,

<aside>Abels Sacrifice acceptable, & not Cains, by some external signe.</aside>

*of the first begotten of his flock, and of their fatte*. And therfore God respected and accepted his oblation. But to Cain and to his giftes he had not respect, because he wan-ted sincere deuotion. VVhich difference of Gods acceptance appeared doubtles, as S. Hierom and S. Augustin supposed, by some external signe, otherwise Cain had not vnderstood it. Most likely it was by fire sent from God, which inflamed and consumed Abels Sacrifice, & not Cains. As we read of diuers other Sacri-fices in holie Scripture.

<aside>Reward and punishment according to our workes.</aside>

5. *Shalt thou not receiue?*] Reward of good workes, and punishment of euil are clerly proued by this place. God saying to Cain: *If thou doest wel, shalt thou not receiue?* what els but wel for wel doing? as Abel receiued consolation of his Sacrifice wel offered. *But if thou doest il, shal not thy sinne be present forthwith at the dore?* sticking thy conscience, and not suffering thy mind to be in quiet, for remorse of thy wicked fact, and feare of iust iudgement. For hence it came that Cains countenance fel, and his stomack boyled with angre: punish-ment so beginning euen in this life, & much more in the next world our Saui-our witnessing (as him selfe saith) to euery man according to his workes: which the Apostle expresseth more distinctly, *eternal life, to them that by patience in good workes, seeke glorie and honour, and incorruption*.

<aside>Free-wil in man also after his falle.</aside>

5. *Vnder thee* [This Text so plainly sheweth free-wil in man, also after his falle, that the English Protestants to auoid so clere a truth, for these wordes, *the lust thereof (to wit of sinne) shal be vnder thee, and thou shalt haue dominion ouer it*, corruptly translate in some of their Bibles thus: *Vnto thee his desire shalbe subiect, and thou shalt rule ouer him*. As if God had said, that Abel should be vnder Cain. As the phantastical Manichees peruerted the sense, whose absurdi-tie S. Augustin confuteth maintaining the true construction of the wordes, *Tu dominaberis illius; nunquid fratris? absit. Cuius igitur nisi peccati?* Thou shalt rule ouer it; what? ouer thy brother? No. Ouer what then but sinne?] In other English Editions, namely in the last, which we suppose they wil stand to, it is better, but yet obscure thus, *Vnto thee shal be the desire thereof, and thou shalt rule ouer it*.
