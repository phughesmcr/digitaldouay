## Chap. XXXV.

*The precept of the Sabbath is yet renewed. 4. First fruites, and other giftes are required, and duly offered, for the making of the tabernacle and other thinges thereto belonging, which are here recited. 30. Beseleel and Ooliab are appointed workmen for this purpose.*

<aside>After the fall of the people to Idolatrie, their punishment, and repentance, their reconciliation to God and new tables of the commandments made and written, Moyses repeateth the former precept, of keeping the Sabbath, and prouideth al necessaries to the making of the Tabernacle, whereto the Princes and people most promptly and liberally contribute.</aside>
