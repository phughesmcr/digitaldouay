thou shalt redeeme with a sheepe: but if thou wilt not giue
a price for it, it shal be slaine. The firstborne of thy sonnes
thou shalt redeeme: neither shalt thou appeare emptie in
<sup>21</sup> my sight. Six dayes shalt thou worke, the seuenth day thou
<sup>22</sup> shalt cease to eare, and reape. The solemnitie of weekes
thou shalt make to thee, in the first fruites of corne of thy
wheate haruest, and the solemnitie, when the time of the
<sup>23</sup> yeare returneth that al thinges are laid vp. Three tymes
of the yeare al thy male shal appeare in the sight of the
<sup>24</sup> omnipotent Lord God of Israel. For when I shal haue
taken away the nations from thy face, and shal haue dilated
thy borders, no man shal lie in wayte against thy land, when
thou doest goe vp, and appeare in the sight of the Lord thy
<sup>25</sup> God thrise in a yeare. Thou shalt not immolate the bloud
of my hoste vpon leauen: neither shal there remaine in the
morning of the victime of the solemnitie of the Phase.
<sup>26</sup> The first of the fruites of thy ground thou shalt offer in
the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boile a kidde
<sup>27</sup> in the milke of his damme. And our Lord said to Moyses:
Write thee these wordes, in which I haue made a couenant
<sup>28</sup> both with thee and with Israel. Therfore he was there with
our Lord fourtie dayes and fourtie nightes: he did not eate
bread, and he dronke no water, and he wrote in the tables
<sup>29</sup> the wordes of the couenant, tenne. And when Moyses
came downe from the mount Sinai, he held the two tables
of testimonie, and he knew not that his face was horned
<sup>30</sup> by the conuersation of the talke of our Lord. And Aaron
and the children of Israel seing the face of Moyses horned,
<sup>31</sup> they were afraid to come neere. And being called of him,
they returned as wel Aaron as the princes of the synagogue.
<sup>32</sup> And after that he spake to them, al the children of Israel
also came to him: whom he commanded al thinges that he
<sup>33</sup> had heard of our Lord in mount Sinai. And hauing ended
<sup>34</sup> his talke, he put a veile vpon his face. Which going in
to our Lord, and speaking with him, he toke away vntil he
went forth, and then he spake to the children of Israel al
<sup>35</sup> thinges that had bene commanded him. Who saw that the
face of Moyses coming forth was horned, but he couered
his face againe, if at anie time he spake to them.

[^1]: God by an Angel not Moyses. *Iosue* 1. & *Deut.* 10. v. 2. & 4.

[^2]: How soeuer the commandments are diuided in both tables, here it is certaine, that there be no more nor fewer then tenne in al.

[^3]: So his face appeared to the beholders, by reason of the glistering beames of his countenance shining gloriously, after his conuersation with God fourtie dayes: which signifieth that much more that which S. Paul (2 *Cor.* 3.) termaineth vpon the hart of the seruants of Christ, til by his special grace they shal be illuminated: 2 *Cor.* 3. The like is vpon the hart of Heretikes that can not see the Church. *S. Aug.* in *Psal.* 30. *con.* 2.
