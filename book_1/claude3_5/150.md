# Genesis

<sup>30</sup> And being astonyed, and trubled amongst them-selues, they said: What is this, that God hath done vnto vs?

<sup>31</sup> And they came to Iacob their father into the land of Chanaan, and they told him al thinges that had chanced vnto them, saying:

<sup>32</sup> The lord of the land spake to vs roughly, and thought vs to be spies of the prouince, to whom we answered: We are men of peace, neither do we attempt any treachery.

<sup>33</sup> We are twelue brethren borne of one father: one is not liuing, the youngest is with our father in the Land of Chanaan.

<sup>34</sup> Who said to vs: Thus shal I trie that you be men of peace: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take ye prouision necessarie for your houses, and goe your wayes, and bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receiue this felowe againe, that is kept in prison: and afterwardes may haue licence to bye what thinges you wil.

<sup>35</sup> This being said, when they powred out their corne, euerie man found his money tied in the mouth of the sackes: and al being astonyed together,

<sup>36</sup> their father Iacob said: You haue made me to be without children, Ioseph is not liuing, Simeon is kept in bondes, and Beniamin you wil take away: al these euils are fallen vpon me.

<sup>37</sup> To whom Ruben an-swered: Kil my two sonnes, if I bring him not againe to thee: deliuer him into my hand, and I wil restore him vnto thee.

<sup>38</sup> But he said: My sonne shal not go downe with you: his brother is dead; and he alone is remayning: if any ad-uersitie shal chance to him in the land to the which you goe, you shal bring downe my hoare heares with sorowe vnto hel.

[^1]: 7. *Spake roughly*] Ioseph afflicted his bretheren to bring them into consideration of their former faultes, and to true contrition. VVithout which, though iniuries be remitted by men, yet the offenders are not absolued before God. Therfore he louing them, and hating their sinne, by affliction brought them to vnderstanding. VVho being at last truly penitent, he acknowledged and most louingly embraced them, and prouided for them in their necessitie.
