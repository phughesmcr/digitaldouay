# GENESIS

[^1] Let vs therefore examine the sense, and if S. Hierome, the great scripture Doctor did rightly vnderstand it, God did speake to this effect to Cain: *Because thou hast freewil, I warne thee before, that sinne may not dominate ouer thee, but thou ouer sinne, in Gen.*

[^2] The Hebrew thus: *et te appetitus eius, et tu dominaberis in eum, or, et tu dominare ei.*

[^3] Thargum Hierosolimitanum concludeth Gods speach to Cain thus: *In thy hand I haue geuen power of thy concupiscence, and haue thou dominion therof: whether thou wilt to good or to euil.* The Greke hath thus: *To thee is the conuersion therof, and thou shalt beare rule ouer it:* to wit, appetite, lust, concupiscence is vnder thy wil. Finally, al antiquitie vniuersallie, and vniforme consent of Christian Doctors, and other learned Philosophers, and reasonable men hold it for certaine and an euident truth, that man hath freewil. Yet Luther, the father of Protestants, so abhorred this very truth, that he could not abide the very word, nor yoursafe (*when he writ against it*) to vse his accustomed booke, *Contra liberum arbitrium*, *Against freewil*, but, *De seruo arbitrio*, *Of seruil arbitrament*. And denieth that man is in aniwise free to choose, to resolue, or determine, but in al things seruil, tyed, constrained, and compelled to whatsoever he doth, saith, or thinketh. Further, that man in al his actions is like to a hackeney, that is, forced to goe whither the rider wil haue him. And knowing the whole world against him, shameth not to confesse, that he feteth them al as naught in respect of him selfe, concluding thus: *I haue not (saith he) conferred with anie in this booke, but I haue affirmed, and I do affirme Neither wil I that anie man iudge hereof, but I counsel al to obey*. *Sic volo, sic iubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas*. Calvin also for his part, confesseth in his heresie with Luther, but more faintly rather wisheth, then imagineth that men be so madde, as to flee from the name of freewil. *I* (saith Calvin) *neither my selfe would vse this word, and I would wish others were from it*. But we wil be bold to oppose S. Hieromes reason against Luther, Calvin, al Manichees, and others that denie freewil. *God made vs* (saith he) *with freewil, neither are we drawen by necessitie to vertues nor to vices, otherwise where is no voluntarie, there is neither damnation nor crowne*.

<sup>16</sup> Cain went forth. It is a marke of Heretikes to make breach, and goe forth of the Church. And commonly it cometh of enuie. *Some moue seditions and schismes* (saith S. Cyprian) *when they enuie Bishops, which enuie either complaineth that him selfe was not rather ordained, or disdaineth to suffer an other aboue him. Herevpon he kicketh, herevpon he rebelleth, emulation causeth him to be malicious, because his pride maketh him mad and reiected*: and his brother iust, and elected. So going forth obstinate, obdurate, and desperate in his sinne, and being reprobate of God, began a wicked Citie, opposite to the Citie of God. Wherefore Moyses, as S. Augustin noteth, intending to describe, and shew the perpetual continuance of Gods Citie, the true Church, from Adam, which he doth by the line of Seth to Noe, and so forward to his owne time, would not omit to tel also the progenie of Cain, euen to the floode, wherin al his ofspring was finally drowned and destroyed, that the true Citie of God might appeare more distinct, more conspicuous, & more renowned. And therin deede the same only (and none other broken and interrupted companies or conuenticles) might be knowen to be the true Church of God.

[^4] So hard and obscure is this place, that S. Hierom required by S. Damasus Pope to expound it, dareth not affirme anie one sense for certaine, but proposing diuers, which the text may seeme to beare, wisheth the Pope (who was also very learned) to examine al more at large: putting him in mind that Origen writ his twelfth and thirteenth bookes vpon this onlie place.
