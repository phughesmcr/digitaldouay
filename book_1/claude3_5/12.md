great sadnes, and sorow of hart; not so much for our owne
affliction, for that is comfortable, but for you our brethren, and kinsmen in flesh and bloud. Wishing with our
owne temporal damage whatsoeuer, your saluation. Now
is the acceptable time, now are the dayes of saluation, the
time of Grace by Christ, whose dayes manie Kinges & Prophetes desired to see: they saw them (in *spirit*) and reioyccd.
But we are made partakers of Christ, and his Mysteries; so
that our selues neglect not his heauenly riches: if we receiue
& kepe the beginning of his substance, firme vnto the end;
that is, the true Catholique faith; building theron good
workes by his grace; without which we cannot thinke a
good thought, by which we can do al thinges necessarie
to saluation. But if we hold not fast this ground, al the building fayleth. Or if confessing to know God in wordes, we
denie him in deedes, committing workes of darknes;
or omitting workes of mercie, when we may doe them to
our distressed neighbours; brifly if we haue not charitie, the
forme and perfection of al vertues, al is lost, and nothing
worth. But if we builde vpon firme grounde, gold, siluer,
and precious stones, such building shal abide, and make
our vocation sure by good workes, as S. Peter speaketh.
These (saith S. Paul) are the heyres of God, coheyres of
Christ. Neither is the number of Christs blessed children
counted, as of the Iewes, an hundred fourtie foure thousand;
of euerie tribe of Israel twelue thousand signed; but a most
great multitude of Catholique Christians, which no man
can number, of al nations, and tribes, and peoples, and
tongues, standing before the throne of the lambe, clothed
in white robes, and palmes (*of triumph*) in their handes:
hauing ouercome tentations in the vertuous race of good
life. Much more those which also indure persecution for
the truthes sake, shal receiue most copious great rewardes
in heauen. For albeit the passions of this time (*in themselues*)
are not condigne, to the glorie to come, that shal be reue-
