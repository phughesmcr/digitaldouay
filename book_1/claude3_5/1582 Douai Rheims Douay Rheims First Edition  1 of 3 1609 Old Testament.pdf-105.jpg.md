GENESIS.

<aside>Isaac. see that Gods forseeing, predestinating, and promising exclude not, but in & not exclude dede include secondarie causes, and ordinarie meanes, by which his eternal the meanes by wil and pleasure is fulfilled. For as God did forsee that Rebecca should haue which his wil children, so he did forsee, that Isaac should get them, and obteyne it; and the is done. one was as sure to come to passe as the other. And the same consequence is true concerning eternal life as S. Gregorie teacheth. li. 1. c. 8. Dialog.</aside>

<aside>The couenant made to Abraham pertained only to Isaac, and Iacob, not to the rest of his issue.</aside>

[^1] The elder shal serue the younger. As before (c. 17. v. 21. &. c. 21. v. 12.) The couenant and great promises made to Abrahams sede, are declared to pertaine only to Isaac, and not to Ismael, nor to other brothers: so the same belong not to Esau, the elder, but only to Iacob the younger sonne of Isaac, as the Holie Ghost saying, *The elder shal serue the younger*. And withal signifieth, (saith S. Augustin) that the elder people of the Iewes shal serue the younger Christian people. For although it may be vnderstood literally to be fulfilled, in that the Idumeans coming of Esau, were subdued by King Dauid coming of Iacob; yet it is more conueniently beleeued, that this prophecie tended to a greater thing. And what is this, but that which is euidently fulfilled in the Iewes and Christians?

[^2] An other great document of grace S. Paul geathereth vpon this Mysterie: Gods mere mercie in electing ane, his iustice to the reprobate.

[^3] Gods mere mercie in electing ane, his iustice to the reprobate.

[^4] Jacob lawfully bought but Esau sinned in selling the first-birthright.

CHAP. XXVI.

*Isaac by reason of famine goeth into Gerara, 3. where God reneweth to him the promises made to Abraham. 9. King Abimelech blameth him for calling his wife his sister. 15. the people enuying his wealth, quareleth for his welles. 26. At last Abimelech maketh league with Isaac.*

<aside>God by Abrahams examplar life inuited the Egyptians to true religion: now commandeth Isaac to stay in Gerara to the like end. S. Theod. q. 76. in Gen.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> AND when a famine was risen in the land, after that sterilitie, that had chanced in the dayes of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech King of the Palestines into Gerara. <sup>2</sup> And our Lord appeared to him, and said: Goe not downe into Egypt, but rest in the land which I shal tel thee. <sup>3</sup> And seiourne in it, and I wil be with thee, and wil blesse thee: for to thee and to thy seed, I wil geue al these countries, accomplishing the oath which I sware to Abraham thy father. <sup>4</sup> And
