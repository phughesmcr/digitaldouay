wrath against them (for the one was chiefe of the cupbea-
rers, the other chiefe baker) <sup>3</sup> he sent them into the prison
of the captaine of the souldiers, in the which Ioseph also
was prisoner. <sup>4</sup> But the keeper of the prison deliuered them
to Ioseph, who also ministred to them: some litle time was
passed, and they were kept in custodie. <sup>5</sup> And they sawe
ech of them both a dreame in one night, according to an
interpretation agreing to them selues: <sup>6</sup> to whom when
Ioseph was entred in the morning, and saw them sad, <sup>7</sup> he
asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder to day
then it was woont? <sup>8</sup> Who answered: We haue seene a
dreame, & there is no bodie to interprete it to vs. And Ioseph
said to them: Why "doth not interpretation belong to God?
Tel me what you haue seene. <sup>9</sup> The chiefe of the cup-
bearers first told his dreame: I saw before me a vine,
<sup>10</sup> wherin were three branches, growing by litle and litle
into buddes, and after the blossomes the grapes waxed ripe:
<sup>11</sup> and the cup of Pharao in my hand: and I tooke the gra-
pes, and wrong them into the cup which I held, and I gaue
the cup to Pharao. <sup>12</sup> Ioseph answered: This is the inter-
pretation of the dreame: The three branches, are yet three
dayes: <sup>13</sup> after the which Pharao wil remember thy seruice,
and wil restore thee to thy old degree: and thou shalt geue

haddest wont to doe. <sup>14</sup> Only remember me, when it shal be
wel with thee, and doe me this mercie: to put Pharao in
mind that he take me out of this prison: <sup>15</sup> because I was
taken away by stealth, out of the land of the hebrewes, and
here an innocent was I cast into the lake. <sup>16</sup> The maister of
the bakers seing that he had wisely resolued the dreame, he
said: And I also saw a dreame, That I had three baskettes of
meale vpon my head: <sup>17</sup> and that in one basket that was the
higher, I caried al meates that are made by the art of baking,
and that the birds did eate out of it. <sup>18</sup> Ioseph answered:
This is the interpretation of the dreame: The three baskettes,
<sup>19</sup> are yet three dayes: after the which Pharao wil take thy
head from thee, and hange thee on the crosse, and the foules
shal teare thy flesh. <sup>20</sup> The third day after this was the birth
day of Pharao: who making a great feast to his seruantes,
at the banket he remembred the maister of the cupbearers,
and the chiefe of the bakers. <sup>21</sup> And he restored the one into
