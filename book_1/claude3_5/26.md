Genesis.

Which can be no other but changing bread and wine into his bodie & bloud, seing him selfe expressly sayeth: *This is my bodie, this is my bloud.*

And though Gods blessing in this place, be also a precept, yet it is not to al men for euer: but for the propagation of mankind, which being long since abundantly propagated, the obligation of the precept ceaseth the cause ceasing. So S. Cyprian, S. Ierome, S. Augustin, and other Fathers expound this place. And confirme the same by the text, for immediatly God signifying to what end he spoke, saith: *and replenish the earth*. Which being replenished, Gods wil is therin fulfilled.

CHAP. II.

*The worke of six dayes being finished, God rested the seuenth day & blessed it. 8. Then placing man in paradise (planted with beautiful & swete trees, & watered with foure riuers) 16. comanded him not to eate of the tree of knowledge of good & euil. 18. & formed a woman of a ribbe of Adam.*

<sup>1</sup>THE heauens therfore & the earth were fully finished, and al the furniture of them. <sup>2</sup>And the seuenth day God ended his worke which he had made: & rested the seuenth day, from al worke that he had done. <sup>3</sup>And he blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it: because in it he had ceased from al his worke which God created to make. <sup>4</sup>These are the generations of heauen & earth, when they were created in the day, when our Lord God made the heauen, and the earth. <sup>5</sup>And euery plant of the fielde, before it shotvp in the earth. And euerie herbe of the ground before it sprang: for our Lord God had not rayned vpon the earth: and man was not to til the earth: <sup>6</sup>But a spring rose out of the earth, watering al the outermost part of the earth. <sup>7</sup>Our Lord God therfore formed man of the slyme of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, & man became a liuing soule.

<sup>8</sup>And our Lord God had planted a Paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherin he placed man whom he had formed. <sup>9</sup>And our Lord God brought forth of the ground al maner of trees, fayre to behold: and pleasant to eate of: the tree of life also in the middle of Paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good & euil. <sup>10</sup>And a riuer issued out of the place of pleasure to water Paradise, which from thence is diuided into four heades. <sup>11</sup>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth al the land of Heuilath, where gold groweth. <sup>12</sup>And the gold of that land is very good:

[^1]: Not al men & women commanded to marie.

[^2]: God createth not new kindes of creatures, yet stil worketh. Io. 5, 17. conseruing & gouerning al things and createth soules, grace, and glorie of the same kind S. Aug. li. 4 de Gen. ad lit. c.12.,

[^3]: Mans soule is immediatly created by god not produced of other substance as the soules of beastes and plants are.

[^4]: Whether this paradise be now extant is vncertayne, though it be certaine that Enoch and Elias are yet liuing in earth. S. Aug. li. 2. cont. Pelagi. c. 23. See Pererius. li. 3. q. 5. & li. 7. q. vltima.
