Genesis.

<sup>25</sup> God be with you. ] For the same reasons Ioseph would be finally buried in Chanaan, for which Iacob desired to be there buried (chap. 47.) Ioseph, for his brethren's sake, deferred his desired burial in Chanaan.

but Ioseph would not presently be caried thither, lest it might haue geuen of-
fence to the Ægyptians, or at least haue diminished their fauoure towardes his
brethren: and withal he would confirme his brethren in their hope of retur-
ning; seing he was content, that his bodie should expect in Ægypt, til the
whole Nation should returne into Chanaan.
