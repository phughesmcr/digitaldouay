ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXIIII.

<aside>14. The maide to whom I shal say] Obseruation of speaches called ominous, which are interpreted to signifie good or euil luck, are sometimes superstitious, & suggested by euil spirites, who now & then telling, or insinuating some truth, gette credite, and so allure men to attend to such vaine, vncertaine, and vnlawful signes. as S. Augustin telleth li. 2. de Gen. ad lit. c. 17. & li. 12. c. 22.) Neuertheles such signes are sometimes lawfully obserued, & desired from God, as the same Doctor sheweth (li. qu√¶st. super Gen q. 55. and S. Chrysostome teacheth more clerely (ho. 48. in Gen.) likewise S. Theodore (q. 73. in Gen.) But whosoever wil not erre in particular cases, must folow either expresse Scripture, or the iudgement of the Church, which is alwayes directed by the spirite of truth. And touching this prayer of Abrahams seruant, and his desire of this determinate signe, to know the maide, whom God had prouided to be Isaachs wife, the fathers generally hold that it was religious, deuout, and discrete. For he being careful of his masters busines, and not trusting his owne iudgement, but relying vpon that Abraham had said, Our Lord shal send his Angel before thee, commended the weightie cause to God by prayer, the Angel suggesting both to him to desire, and to the maide to performe; as the euent sheweth (such qualities and vertues in her, as were most agreable to the great charitie and hospitalitie dayly practised in Abrahams house, most conuenient and necessarie (as he discretely considered) for that familie, and good of manie. The like obseruations were approued in Gedeon, and Ionathas. And to pray for such signes in some cases, or for manifest miracles is also approued by the Apostles example praying God To shew by lote which of the two he had chosen to the Apostleship, in place of Iudas. And that he would extend his hand to cures, & signes, & wonders, to be done by the name of his holie sonne IESVS.</aside>
