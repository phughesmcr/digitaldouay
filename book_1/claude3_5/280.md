mentes, that they may minister to me, and the vnction of them may prosper to an euerlasting priesthood. <sup>14</sup> And Moyses did al thinges which our Lord had commanded. <sup>15</sup> Therfore the first moneth of the second yeare, the first day of the moneth, the tabernacle was placed. <sup>16</sup> And Moyses erected it, and put the bordes and feete and barres, and reared the pillers, <sup>17</sup> and spred the roofe ouer the tabernacle, putting ouer it a couer, as our Lord had commanded. <sup>18</sup> He put also the testimonie in the arke, thrusting barres vnderneth, and the oracle aboue. <sup>19</sup> And when he had brought the arke into the tabernacle, he drew before it the veile to fulfil the commandement of our Lord. <sup>20</sup> He sette the table also in the tabernacle of testimonie at the north side without the veile, <sup>21</sup> ordering the bread of proposition before it, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. <sup>22</sup> He sette the candlesticke also in the tabernacle of testimonie ouer against the table on the south side, <sup>23</sup> placing the lampes in order, according to the precept of our Lord. <sup>24</sup> He set also the altar of gold vnder the roofe of testimonie against the veile, <sup>25</sup> and burned vpon it the incense of spices, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. <sup>26</sup> He put also the hanging in the entrie of the tabernacle of testimonie, <sup>27</sup> and the altar of holocauste in the entrie of the testimonie, offering on it the holocauste, and the sacrifices, as our Lord had commanded. <sup>28</sup> The lauer also he set betwen the tabernacle of testimonie and the altar, filling it with water. <sup>29</sup> And Moyses and Aaron, and his sonnes washed their handes and feete, <sup>30</sup> when they entred the roofe of couenant, and went to the altar, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. <sup>31</sup> He erected also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entrie therof. Afteral thinges were perfited, <sup>32</sup> the cloude couered the tabernacle of testimonie, and the glorie of our Lord filled it. <sup>33</sup> Neither could Moyses enter the roofe of couenant, the cloude couering al thinges, and the maiestie of our Lord shining, because the cloude had couered al thinges. <sup>34</sup> If at anie time the cloud did leaue the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troupes: <sup>35</sup> If it hong ouer, they remained in the same place. <sup>36</sup> For the cloude of our Lord honge ouer the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of al the children of Israel throughout al their mansions.
