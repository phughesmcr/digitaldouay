Paul, *The father of al that beleue* (Ro. 4. v. 11) where the Apostle teacheth that Abraham had no iustice, nor estimation of iustice before God, vntil he beleued in Christ (v. 18, 19, 20) because al workes before that faith are insufficient. Neyther was this a sole faith but had other necessarie vertues of hope, and charitie, humilitie, reuerence, obedience, & the like ioyned with it. Wherfore S. Iames testifieth that Abraham was iustified by workes (that is by workes folowing faith not going before faith. For faith (saith he) *it is but not vvorketh, is dead in it self* (c. 2. v. 17) *And by vvorkes Abrahams faith vvas consummat*. v. 22. And concludeth thus; Do yee see, that by workes a man is iustified and not by faith only. v. 24.
