Who said: Do as thou hast spoken. <sup>6</sup> Abraham made hast into the tent to Sara, and said to her: Make hast, temper togeather three measures of floure, and make harth cakes. <sup>7</sup> But him selfe ranne to the heard, and tooke from thence a calfe verie tender and verie good, and <sup>8</sup> gaue it to a young man: who made hast and boiled it. <sup>8</sup> He tooke also butter and mylke, and the calfe which he had boyled, and set before them: but him selfe did stand beside them vnder the tree. <sup>9</sup> And when they had eaten, they said to him: Where is Sara thy wife?
