ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXVII.

<sup>19</sup> *I am thy first begotten Esau.*] Jacob was not by nature the first begotten; but by Gods ordinance, & by couenant made with Esau, had right to the preeminence, and priuileges belonging to the first borne. So he did not lie, but spake a truth, meaning that he was that sonne, to whom by diuine election the first-birth-right was dew, which his father supposed to pertaine to Esau. But because some (scorners of Christian doctrin like to the old Manichees) vie to say, that Catholique Doctors, and Schoolmen excuse, and condemne whom they list by such glosses, let such reprouers vnderstand, that both moderne and ancient Catholique writers auow this defence of the holie Patriarch Jacob, not by priuate spirit, but by the most true and proper sense of holie Scripture it selfe. Where it may appeare, if they wil examine the text, that Jacob in al this procurement of his fathers blessing, neither did aniething vniustly, nor said anie thing falsly. First it was reuealed to his mother (chap. 25. v. 23.) *That the elder* (of her twinnes) *should serue the younger*. Secondly, holie Scripture testifieth in the former chapter (v. 27.) *that Iacob was a plaine* (or sincere) *man, void of vniust dealing*. Thirdly, for more quiet enioying that right, which God had ordained for him, he procured his brothers consent and confirmation (v. 31.) Fourthly though he was secure in conscience that the blessing was dew to him, yet he feared (v. 12.) lest he might geue occasion of offence to his father, to whom this mysterie was not yet reuealed. Fiftly Isaac perceiuing at last Gods wil, that Iacob should be preferred, was neither offended with him, nor reuoked his blessing, as vnlawfully surprised, but condescending therto, ratified that he had done, saying (v. 33.) *I haue blessed him, and he shal be blessed*. Sixtly, God himselfe from this time forwards often appeared to Iacob, and with great promises, and manie temporal and spiritual benefites, declared his singular loue to him. Seuenthly, these three Patriarches Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob are special renowned Sainctes of the old Testament: yea the Lord and Creator of al would peculiarly be called (*Exodi. 3.*) the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Moyses praying instantly for Gods mercie and clemencie towards his people (*Exodi. 32.*) besought him to remember Abraham Isaac, and Iacob his seruants: and so in both old and new Testament these three are often mentioned as chief Princes in the Kingdom of Heauen. Al which shew the great vertues and holines of them al.

And touching this fact of Iacob, where (if euer aniewhere) might seme to be some great sinne, S. Augustin at large proueth that he did not herein sinne at al: *That which Iacob did* (saith he, li. cont. mendacium c. 10.) *by his mothers instruction to deceiue his father, if it be diligently considered, was no lie, but a mysterie, and therfore he is excused from sinne*. The same he confirmeth. q. 74. in Gen. li. 16. c. 37. de ciuit. & li. 22. c. 34 cont. Faust. The same also teach S. Chrisostom ho. 53 in Gen. S. Hierom. Epist. 125. S. Theodoretus. q. 79. & 80. in Gen. S. Gregorie, ho. 6. in Ezechielem. S. Bede, Isidorus, Innocentius 3. Rupertus and others vpon this place, al agreing absolutely that euerie lie is a sinne, and that Iacob lied not, but stil spake the truth. confirming their exposition by other like
