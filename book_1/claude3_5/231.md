<sup>1</sup>according to the word of our Lord, camped in Raphidim, where there was no water for the people to drinke. <sup>2</sup>Who chiding against Moyses, said: Geue vs water, that we may drinke. To whom Moyses answered: Why chide you against me: wherefore doe you tempt our Lord? <sup>3</sup>The people therfore was thirstie there for lacke of water, and murmured against Moyses, saying: Why didst thou make vs goe forth out of Ã†gypt, to kil vs, and our children, and our beastes with thirst? <sup>4</sup>And Moyses cried to our Lord, saying: What shal I doe to this people? Yet a litle while, and they wil stone me. <sup>5</sup>And our Lord said to Moyses: Goe before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and the rodde wherwith thou didst strike the riuer, take in thy hand, and goe. <sup>6</sup>Behold I wil stand there before thee, vpon the rocke Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rocke, and water shal goe out therof, that the people may drinke. Moyses did so before the ancientes of Israel: <sup>7</sup>and he called the name of that place, Temptation, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted our Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst vs or not? <sup>8</sup>And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in Raphidim. <sup>9</sup>And Moyses sayd to Iosue: Choose out men: and goe forth and fight against Amalec: to morow I wil stand in the toppe of the hil, hauing the rodde of God in my hand. <sup>10</sup>Iosue did as Moyses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec: but Moyses and Aaron and Hur went vp vpon the toppe of the hil. <sup>11</sup>And when Moyses lifted vp his handes, Israel ouercame: but if he did lette them downe a litle, Amalec ouercame. <sup>12</sup>And the handes of Moyses were heauie: therfore they tooke a stone, and putte vnder him, wherupon he sate: and Aaron and Hur staied vp his handes on both sides. And it came to passe that his handes were not wearie vntil sunne sette. <sup>13</sup>And Iosue put Amalec to flight, & his people by the edge of the sword. <sup>14</sup>And our Lord said to Moyses: Write this for a monument in a booke, & deliuer it to the eares of Iosue: for I wil destroy the memorie of Amalec from vnder heauen. <sup>15</sup>And Moyses builded an Altar: and called the name therof, Our Lord my exaltation, saying: <sup>16</sup>Because the hand of our Lords throne, and the warre of our Lord shal be against Amalec, from generation vnto generation.

<aside>If this ceremonie of holding vp his handes was of such importance in the law of nature, why do Heretikes deride the same, and the like in the Catholique Church?</aside>

<aside>Wheras also our Sauiour lifting vp his handes blessed his disciples. Luc. 24. S. Damascen also teacheth li. 4. c. 12. orthod.</aside>

<aside>that this extension of his handes prefigured the Crosse of Christ. And how it representeth the same.</aside>
