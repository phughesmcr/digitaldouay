13 dwelled in Sodom. <sup>13</sup>And behold one, that had escaped, told Abram the Hebrew, that dwelt in the vale of Mambre, the Amorrean brother of Eschol, and the brother of Aner: 14 for these had made a league with Abram. <sup>14</sup>Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the servants borne in his house, wel appointed three hundred and eighteen: and pursued them unto 15 Dan. <sup>15</sup>And dividing his companie, he ranne vpon them in the night: and stroke them, and pursued them vnto Hoba, 16 which is on the left hand of Damascus. <sup>16</sup>And he brought backe al the substance, and Lot his brother with his substance, the women also and the people. <sup>17</sup>And the king of Sodom went forth to meete them, after he returned from the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kinges that were with him in the vale Sauee, which is the kings vale. 18 <sup>18</sup>But Melchisedech the king of Salem, " bringing forth bread and wine, for he was the Priest of God most highe, 19 " blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram to God the high20 est, which created heaven and earth: <sup>20</sup>and blessed be God the highest, by whose protection, the enemyes are in thy hands.

18. *Melchisedech*] S. Hierom being earnestly requested by Euagrius, to geue his iudgement touching Melchisedech, whom a nameles author had endeuored to proue to be the Holie Ghost, plainly confuteth that error: as also an other error of Origen and Didymus saying, he was an Angel. Likewise S. Epiphanius (*heref. 55. & 76*) relateth and condemneth a third error, of some that thought him to be the Sonne of God. Their reasons S. Augustin (*li. de heresibus her. 34.*) and diuers others, whom S. Hierom alleageth proue euidently, that he was a very man, a Priest and a king, yea the hiegh Priest (at least of that countrie) Superior to Abraham, and a figure of Christ.
