GENESIS. 43

<aside>Sem.</aside>

*The Nations*] How manie Nations and tongues were in the world immediatly after the towre of Babylon, is more cõmonly supposed, then clerly The common shewed by old or late writers. Only it semeth certaine and euident, that opinion of 72. there were iust as manie tongues as Nations. But one finde precisely (as the com- tongues is not mon opinion holdeth) 72, is hard. For in this chapter (where they would clere in Scrip-count this number) are not mentioned so manie. Neuertheles if we adde cer- ture.taine that begane distinct Nations afterwards, til Iacob with his children Yet this num-went into Ægypt (in whom only the Hebrew Nation and Tongue continued ber of nations to Christs time, the number wil come right. Of Iapheth were begotten 7. (as and tongues chiefe of Nations. Againe of Gomer (besides his supposed successor, who can may be proba-not be counted beginner of an other distinct nation) came 4. other heades. bly geathered Likewise of Iauan (besides his first sonne) of 6. more nations. Of Cham by in these and o-his first sonne Chus were 6. nephewes princes of nations. Againe of Regma ther places of (besides his successor) came one more. And Nemrod besides his kingdom of Genesis. Babylon, raysed vp other 6. By his second sonne Mesraim came 8. nations, Chams third sonne Phut made only one nation. And Chanaan his sonnes made 11. more. Of Sem (last mentioned for better connecting the maine Historie, and for erection of the Church) came the chiefe and principal Nation The Hebrews the Hebrewes, descending from him by Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, and so directly chiefe of these to Iacob. Of Sem also were borne 4. other sonnes beginners of nations. Againe out of Aram (besides his first sonne) were 5. fathers of nations. Likwise of Heber (besides the Hebrewes descending by Phaleg) were borne to his other sonne Iectan 13. heades of nations. These are al that are named in this place : to wit, of Iapheth, 14. of Cham 31. and of Sem 27. which make in al 66. wherunto if we adioyne Nachor (Abrahams brother) Moab, and Ammon (Lots sonnes) also Ismael (Abrahams elder sonne) and his issue by Cetura, and finally Esau (Iacobs brother) who made 6. more distinct nations, the whole number is 74. This probable collection, with the rest, we submit to better iudgement.
