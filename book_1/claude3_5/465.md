God did to Marie, in the way when you came out of Ægypt.

<sup>10</sup> When thou shalt require of thy neighbour any thing, that he oweth thee, thou shalt not enter into his house to take away a pledge; <sup>11</sup> but thou shalt stand without, and he shal bring forth to thee that which he hath. <sup>12</sup> but if he be poore, the pledge shal not lodge with thee that night, <sup>13</sup> but forthwith thou shalt restore it to him before the going downe of the sunne: that sleeping in his rayment, he may blesse thee, & thou mayest haue iustice before our Lord thy God. <sup>14</sup> Thou shalt not denie the hyre of the needie, and poore man thy brother, or the stranger, that dwelleth with thee in the land, and is within thy gates: <sup>15</sup> but the same day thou shalt pay him the price of his labour, before the going downe of the sunne, because he is poore, and therewith susteyneth his life: lest he crie against thee to our Lord, and it be reputed to thee for a sinne. <sup>16</sup> The fathers shal not be slaine for the children, nor the children for the fathers, but euerie one shal die for his owne sinne. <sup>17</sup> Thou shalt not peruert the iudgement of the stranger and the pupil, neither shalt thou take away the widowes rayment for a pledge. <sup>18</sup> Remember that thou didst serue in Ægypt, and our Lord thy God deliuered thee from thence. Therefore I command thee that thou doe this thing. <sup>19</sup> When thou hast reaped the corne in thy field, and forgetting hast left a sheafe, thou shalt not returne to take it away: but thou shalt suffer the stranger, and the pupil, and the widow to take it away; that our Lord thy God may blesse thee in al the worke of thy handes. <sup>20</sup> If thou haue gathered the fruites of thy oliue trees, whatsoeuer remaineth on the trees, thou shalt not returne to gather it: but shalt leaue it to the stranger, the pupil, and the widow. <sup>21</sup> If thou make vintage of thy vineyard, thou shalt not gather the clusters that remaine, but they shal goe to the vses of the stranger, the pupil, and the widow. <sup>22</sup> Remember that thou also didst serue in Ægypt, and therefore I command thee that thou doe this thing.

[^1]: Whether this diuorce was tollerated as a lesse sinne, to auoide a greater, as S. Hierom. (*li. 1. in Mat. c. 5. & li. 1. in c. 19.*) S. Chrysostom (*ho. 12. in Mat. 5.*) and others teach; or dispensed withal, and so made lawful
