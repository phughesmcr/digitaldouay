[^1] partarchs are greene herbe, such as seedeth according to his kinde, & tree that beareth fruite, hauing seede eche one according to his kinde. And God saw that it was good. <sup>13</sup> And there was euening & morning that made the third day. <sup>14</sup> Againe God said: Be there lightes made in the firmament of heauen, to diuide the day & the night, and let them be :: for signes & seasons, and dayes and yeares: <sup>15</sup> to shine in the firmament of heauen, & to giue light vpon the earth. And it was so done. <sup>16</sup> And God made "two" :: great lights: a greater light, to gouerne the day: and a lesser light to gouerne the night: and starres. <sup>17</sup> And he set them in the firmament of heauen, to shine vpon the earth. <sup>18</sup> and to gouerne the day & the night, and to diuide the light & the darkenes. And God sawe that it was good. <sup>19</sup> And there was euening and morning that made the fourth day. <sup>20</sup> God also said: Let the waters bring forth creeping creature hauing life, and flying foule, ouer the earth vnder the firmament of heauen. <sup>21</sup> And God created huge Whales, and al liuing & mouing creature, that the waters brought forth, according to eche sorte, & al foule according to their kinde.

And God saw that it was good, <sup>26</sup> and he said: "Let vs make Man to our image, & likenes: and let him haue dominion ouer the fishes of the sea, and the foules of the ayre, and the beastes, and the whole earth, and al creeping creature, that moueth vpon the earth. <sup>27</sup> And God created man, to his owne image: to the image of God he created him, male & female he created them. <sup>28</sup> And God blessed them, and saith: "Increase and multiplie, & replenish the earth, and subdew it, and rule ouer the fishes of the sea, and foules of the ayre, & al liuing creatures, that moue vpon the earth. <sup>29</sup> And God said: Behold I haue giuen you al maner of hearbe that seedeth vpon the earth, and al trees that haue in them selues seede
