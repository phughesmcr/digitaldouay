containing manifest errors, or forged by Heretikes. Neither can a Christian
Catholique be otherwise assured, which Bookes are Diuine and Canonical
Scriptures, but by declaration of the Catholique Church, which without inter-
ruption succeedeth the Apostles, to whom our Sauiour promised<sup>16</sup>, and sent
the Holie Ghost, to teach al truth. For if in anie thing more then others,
assuredly one chief and most necessarie point is, to know and declare, which
Bookes are Gods holie word: being of most singular importance.

# THE SVMME OF THE OLD TESTA-
ment, as it is distinguished from the new.

Notwithstanding the subiect, & general argument of both Testaments
is one & the same in substance, as is already said, yet they differ in
time, in maner of vttering of Mysteries, in varietie of precepts, & promises,
also in meanes to obserue the thinges exacted, & to attayne to the end pro-
posed. In regard wherof S. Ierome saith: Lex Moysi & omne vetus
instrumentum elementa mundi intelliguntur, quibus quasi ele-
mentis, & Religionis exordijs Deum discimus. The law of Moy-
ses and al the old Testament are vnderstood the elements of the
world, by which, as by first rudiments & beginnings, we lerne
to know God. For that in it we haue first the Law of nature: and after-
wards a law written, with promise of temporal rewardes; as long life,
land flowing with milke & honie, & the like; but it brought nothing
to perfection, as S. Paul saith, when giftes & hostes were offered,
which could not according to conscience, make the obseruer
perfect. For the helpes of that time, were but infirma & egena elemeta:
Weake & poore elements. Likewise in general, touching the punish-
ments that sometimes happened to the people of the old Testament, as when they
transgressed, the same Apostle affirmeth, that al the same chanced to
them in figure, & are written for our correction, vpon whom
the ends of the world are come. So that the old Testament, or Law was
but our pedagogue in Christ. Yet it setteth forth to vs the whole course
of Gods Church, for the space of foure thousand yeares, that is, from the begin-
ning of the world vntil Christ our Redemer. which Diuines diuide into six
ages, wherin was varietie & change of her state, three vnder the Law of
nature, and three others vnder the written Law. The seuenth & last age
being the time of grace (wherin we now are) from Christ, to the day of ge-
neral Iudgement: as the world was made in six dayes, and in the seuenth
God is said to haue rested, and therfore sanctified it, in other sort, then the
former six. The eight wil be after the Resurrection, during for al eternitie.
Which six ages of the ancient Church, & old Testament, are thus distri-
buted. The first from the Creation to Noes floud, conteyning the space of 1656.
