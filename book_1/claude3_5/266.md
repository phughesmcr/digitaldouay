## Chapter XXXIII.

God wrath being mitigated by Moyses, the people mourne for their sinnes. Moyses pitcheth the tabernacle without the campe, and therin conuerseth familiarly with God. 18. desiring to see his glorie.

<sup>1</sup>And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: Goe, get thee vp from this place, thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the Land of Ægypt, into the land wherof I sware to Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, saying: To thy seede I wil giue it: <sup>2</sup>and I wil send an Angel thy precursor, that I may cast out the Chananeite, and Amorrheite, and Hetheite, and Pherezeite, and Heueite, and Iebuseite, <sup>3</sup>and thou maiest enter into the land that floweth with milke and honey: for I wil not goe vp with thee, because thou art a stiffenecked people: lest perhappes I destroie thee in the way. <sup>4</sup>And the people hearing this verie il saying, mourned: and no man put on his ornamentes after the custome. <sup>5</sup>And our Lord sayd to Moyses: Speake to the children of Israel: Thou art a stiffenecked people, once I shal goe vp in the middes of thee, and shal destroy thee.
