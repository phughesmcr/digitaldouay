And so the Arke was at least in length 450. foote, in breadth 75. in height 45. or at most in length 525. foote, in breadth 87. and a halfe: in height 52. and a halfe. And either of these capacities was sufficient to receiue al the thinges here mentioned, considering the loftes & partions, that were in the whole arke.
