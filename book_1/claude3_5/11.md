God. This groundworke therefore of our creation in Christ by true faith, S. Paul labored most seriously by word and writing, to establish in the hartes of al men. In this he confirmed the Romanes by his Epistle, commending their faith, as already receiued, and renowmed in the whole world. He preached the same faith to manie Nations. Amongst others to the lerned Athenians. Where it semed to some, as absurde, as strange; in so much that they scornfully called him *a word-sower*, and Preacher of new gods. But S. Augustine alloweth the terme for good, which was reprochfully spoken of the ignorant. And so distinguishing betwen *Reapers*, and *Sowers* in Gods Church, he teacheth, that wheras the other Apostles reaped in the Iewes, that which their Patriarches and Prophetes had sowne; S. Paul sowed the seede of Christian Religion in the Gentiles. And so in respect of the Israelites, to whom they were first sent, calleth the other Apostles *Messores*, *Reapers*, and S. Paul, being specially sent to the Gentiles, *Seminatorem a Sower*, or *Seminarie Apostle*. Which two sortes of Gods workmen are stil in the Church, with distinct offices of Pastoral cures, and Apostolical missions; the one for perpetual gouernment of Catholique countries: the other for conuersion of such, as either haue not receiued Christian Religion, or are relapsed. As at this time in our country, for the diuers sortes of pretended religions, these diuers spiritual workes are necessary, to teach and feede al Britan people. Because some in error of opinions preach an other Gospel, wheras in veritie there is no other Gospel. They preach in dede new doctrines, which can not saue. Others folow them beleuing falshood. But *when the blinde lead the blinde* (not the one only, but) *both fal into the ditch*. Others conforme themselues, in external shew, fearing them that can punish, and kil the bodie. But *our Lord wil bring such as decline into* (vniust) *obligations, with them that worke iniquitie*. The Reliques and final flock of Catholiques in our country, haue
