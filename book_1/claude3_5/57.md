<sup>16</sup> Goe forth of the arke, thou & thy wife, thy sonnes and the wiues of thy sonnes with thee. <sup>17</sup> Al cattle, that are with thee of al flesh, as wel in foules, as in beastes, & al creepers: that crepe vpon the earth, bring out with thee, & goe yee vpon the earth: increase and multiplie vpon it. <sup>18</sup> Noe therefore went forth, and his sonnes: his wife, and the wiues of his sonnes with him. <sup>19</sup> Yea and al cattle, beastes, and creepers that crepe vpon the earth, according to their kinde, went forth out of the arke. <sup>20</sup> And Noe built an Altar to our Lord: and taking of al cattle and foules that were cleane, offered Holocaustes vpon the Altar. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord smelled a sweete sauour: and said: I wil no more curse the earth for men: for the sense and cogitation of mans hart are prone to euil from their youth: I wil no more therefore strike euerie liuing soule as I haue done. <sup>22</sup> Al the dayes of the earth, seed-time and haruest, cold and heate, sommer and winter, night and day shal not rest.

ANNOTATIONS.

CHAP. VIII.

[^1] Noe without expresse commandment, and without delay, offereth Sacrifice to God, for the benefite receiued, in his, and his families conseruation, with the other liuing creatures, in that general deluge of the world. *Lyra* learning (saith S. Ambrose) *that to be true thankesgiuing, which is practised, not commanded: a sacrifice he made not by precept, but by inspiration, and the other, especially in the old Testament, being commanded.*

<aside>Noes sacrifice manie wayes commendable.</aside>

[^2] For more solemnitie, he dedicated an apt and permanent place, for this peculiar diuine seruice, *building an Altar to our Lord*. The Hebrew word *mizbeach* (of the verbe *zabach*, to kil, or make sacrifice) and the Greeke *thysiastÄ“rion*, signifie an Altar to sacrifice on, not a common table for meate. He offered *of the cleane* and best fitting beastes pure and deuout Sacrifice is due to God. Moreouer it was large and bountiful, for he offered of al the kindes of cleane beastes and foules. Finally he offered them in *holocauste*, whereat was burned and consumed in the honour of God. How grateful al this was to God, Moyses signifieth saying: *our Lord smelled a sweete sauour*. not that either anie sweete corporal sauour could of it selfe delight God, who is the most spiritual substance, or that the burning of flesh, bones, and bowels of beastes could yeld sweete sauour; but the deuout mind declared by such external duties greatly pleased God. For God requireth both, but specially a sincere hart. As not only diuine Scriptures, and holie Fathers, but also moral Philosophers teach vs. *If there a vertuous thing* (saith Plato writing of sacrifices) *if God had respect rather to the gifte, and sacrifice of men, then to their mind.* lib. *peri tou proseuches*.
