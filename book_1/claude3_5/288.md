afterward vnderstand their sinne, they shal offer for their sinne
a calfe, and shal bring it to the dore of the tabernacle. <sup>15</sup> And
the ancientes of the people shal put their handes vpon the
head therof before our Lord. And the calfe being immolated
in the sight of our Lord, <sup>16</sup> the priest that is annoynted, shal
carie of the bloud into the tabernacle of testimonie, <sup>17</sup> dipping
his finger, and sprinkling seuen times against the veile. <sup>18</sup> And
he shal put of the same bloud on the hornes of the altar, that
is before our Lord, in the tabernacle of testimonie: and the
rest of the bloud, he shal poure at the foote of the altar of
holocauste, which is at the dore of the tabernacle of testi-
monie. <sup>19</sup> And al the fatte therof he shal take vp, & shal
burne it vpon the altar: <sup>20</sup> doing so with this calfe, as he did
also before: and the priest praying for them, our Lord wil be
propitious vnto them. <sup>21</sup> But the calfe it selfe he shal carie
forth without the campe, and shal burne it like as the former
calfe: because it is for the sinne of the multitude. <sup>22</sup> If a
Prince sinne, and by ignorance do of manie thinges one, that
by the law of our Lord is forbidden: <sup>23</sup> and afterward vnder-
standeth his sinne, he shal offer an hoste to our Lord, a bucke
of the goates without spotte. <sup>24</sup> And he shal put his hand
vpon the head therof: and when he hath immolated it in the
place where holocaust is wont to be slaine before our Lord,
because it is for sinne, <sup>25</sup> the priest shal dippe his finger in the
bloud of the hoste for sinne, touching the hornes of the altar
of holocauste, and the rest powring at the foote therof.
<sup>26</sup> But the fatt he shal burne vpon it, as is wont to be done in
the victimes of pacifiques: and the priest shal pray for him,
and for his sinne, and it shal be forgiuen him. <sup>27</sup> And if a
soule of the people of the land shal sinne through ignorance,
doing anie of those thinges, that by the law of our Lord are
forbidden, and offending, <sup>28</sup> and knoweth his sinne, he shal
offer a she goate without spotte. <sup>29</sup> And he shal put his hand
vpon the head of the host that is for sinne, and shal immolate
it in the place of holocaust. <sup>30</sup> And the priest shal take vp of
the bloud with his finger: and touching the hornes of the al-
tar of holocaust, the rest he shal powre out at the foote therof.
<sup>31</sup> But taking away al the fatt, as is wont to be taken away
of the victimes of pacifiques, he shal burne it vpon the altar,
for a sweete sauour to our Lord: and he shal pray for him,
and it shal be forgeuen him. <sup>32</sup> But if he offer of the flocke
a victime,
