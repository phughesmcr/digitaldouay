that by right succeedeth his father, shal offer it here, for a most swete odour to the Lord, and it shal wholy be burnt on the altar. <sup>23</sup> For euerie sacrifice of the priest shal be consumed with fire, neither shal anie man eate therof. <sup>24</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>25</sup> Speake to Aaron and his sonnes: This is the law of the hoste for sinne. In the place where the holocaust is offered, shal it be immolated before our Lord. It is Holie of holies. <sup>26</sup> The priest that doth offer it, shal eate it in a holie place, in the courte of the tabernacle. <sup>27</sup> Whatsoeuer shal touch the flesh therof, shal be sanctified. If of the bloud therof a garment be sprinkled, it shal be washed in a holie place. <sup>28</sup> And the earthen vessel, wherin it was sodden, shal be broken but if the vessel be of brasse, it shal be scoured, and washed with water. <sup>29</sup> Euerie male of the priestlie race shal eate of the flesh therof, because it is Holie of holies. <sup>30</sup> For the hoste that is slaine for sinne, whose bloud is caried into the tabernacle of testimonie to make expiation in the Sanctuarie, shal not be eaten, but shal be burnt with fire.

CHAP. VII.

*The maner of offering hostes for offences. 11. and of pacifique victimes for thankesgeuing. 22. No fatte, 26. nor bloud is to be eaten.*

THIS also is the lawe of an hoste for an offence, the most Holie: <sup>2</sup> therefore where the holocaust is immolated, the victime also for an offence shal be slaine: the bloud therof shal be poured round about the altar. <sup>3</sup> They shal offer therof the rumpe and the fatte that couereth the entrailes: <sup>4</sup> the two litle kidneys, and the fatte that is beside the guttes, and the caule of the lyuer with the two litle kidneys. <sup>5</sup> And the priest shal burne them vpon the altar: it is the burnt sacrifice of our Lord for an offence. <sup>6</sup> Euerie male of the priests stocke, in a holie place shal eate this flesh, because it is most Holie. <sup>7</sup> As the hoste for sinne is offered, so also that for an offence: the lawe of both hostes shal be one: to the priest that offereth it, it shal pertaine. <sup>8</sup> The priest that offereth the victime of holocaust, shal haue the skinne therof. <sup>9</sup> And euerie sacrifice of flowre, that is baked in the ouen, and whatsoeuer is prepared vpon the grediron, or in the frying panne, it shal be that priestes by whom

<aside>By flesh of penance is vnder stood, fasting, watching, haire cloth, teares, praiers, almes which whoso euer duly tou cheth, shal be sanctified. In Schola Histori. li. 2. in Leuit. c. 6.</aside>

[^1]: This text sheweth there is difference in the nature of a fault com mitted, com monly called sinne, & of du tie omitted here called offence. in latin peccatÅ« and delictum. Yet both are alike offensiue to God, in mat ter of equal importance. As appeareth, for that the same sacrifice was offered for both. v. Aug. q. 20. in Leuit.
