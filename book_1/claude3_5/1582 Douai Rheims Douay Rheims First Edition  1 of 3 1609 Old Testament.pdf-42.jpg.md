ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. VI.

[^1] *Sonnes of God.*] The progenie of Seth, professing true faith & Religion,
were called the sonnes of God: and those of Cains issue and congregation,
following erronious and wicked opinions, were called the sonnes of men.
Which were then the distinctiue termes of true and false Religion, as afterwards were the termes of Iewes and Gentiles: after Christ, Christians and
Paganes: and lastly true and false Christians are distinguished, by the names
of Catholiques and Heretikes. As S. Augustin teacheth, in his questions vpon
Genesis, & other places. Which is confirmed by the like iugement of S. Cyril
Alexandrinus li. 9. aduer. Iulianum. S. Ambrose li. de Noe & arca. c. 4. S. Pacianus epist. ad Sympronianum. Theodorer. & manie others vpon this place.

[^2] *An hundred and twentie yeares.*] Mans life was not here shortened to an
hundred and twentie yeares, as some haue misunderstood this place. For after
this diuers liued much longer, as appeareth in the genealogie of Sem to Abram
(c. 11.) chapter of Genesis. And Abraham liued 175. yeares (c. 25.) Isaac 180.
(c. 35.) Iacob 147. (c. 47.) and Iob did borne 1500. yeares after, liued 210.
yeares (1. Par. 14.) But 120. yeares were granted before the floud for that generation to repent in, as the Chaldee Edition expresseth more plainly:
*Terminus dabitur eis centum viginti annorum si forte conuertantur*. The tearme of an
hundred and twentie yeares shal be geuen them, if perhaps they may conuert.
And so S. Chrisostom. S. Hierom. and S. Augustin expound this Scripture.
Yet whether God cut of 10. of these yeares, and brought the floud after a
100 (for Noe had his sonnes when he was 500. yeares old, & the floud came in
the 600. yeare of his age) or that the warning was geuen twentie yeares before anie of his sonnes were borne, is not so easely decided by the holie Doctors.
How easie soeuer some danie it. A Scripture are. Though vnder correction
of better iudgement, it semeth more probable, that Moyses by anticipation
ioyneth the birth of Noes sonnes (when he was 500. yeares old) to the rest of
the genealogie of the first Patriarches, in the former chapter, and then telleth
of this admonition, geuen 120. yeares before their birth. And so God expected
the peoples repentance the whole time of 120. yeares prescribed.

[^3] *Giants were vpon the earth.*] Some haue thought that these giantes were
not men, nor begotten by men, but that either diuels, which fel at first
from heauen, or other Angels allured with concupiscence, begate them of the
daughters of Cain. Philo Iudeus in his booke de Gigantibus, writeth that
those whom Moyses here called *Angels*, the Philosophers called *Genii*. *Qui
sunt animalia aerea, volant per aerem, apparent visibiles*. Iosephus (li. 1.
Antiq.) saith that Angels begate these giants. Tertullian also li. de habitu
muliebri) holdeth the same error, and diuers more otherwise good authors.
