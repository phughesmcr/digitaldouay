<sup>2</sup> out of his land. And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying:
<sup>3</sup> I am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to
Iacob, as God almightie: and "*my name*" ADONAI I did

bring you forth out of the worke-prison of the Ægyptians,

<sup>13</sup> I am of vncircumcised lippes? And our Lord spake to
Moyses and Aaron, and he gaue them commandement vnto
the children of Israel, & vnto Pharao the king of Ægypt, that
they should bring forth the children of Israel out of the land
<sup>14</sup> of Ægypt. These are Princes of their houses by their families. The sonnes of Ruben the first begotten of Israel:
