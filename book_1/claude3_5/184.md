See that thou doeal the wonders, which I haue put in thy hand, before Pharao: I wil indurate his hart, and he wil not dismisse the people. <sup>22</sup> And thou shalt say to him: This sayth the Lord: My first begotten sonne is Israel. <sup>23</sup> I sayd to thee: dismisse my sonne that he may serue me, & thou wouldest not dismisse him: behold I wil kil thy first-begotten-sonne. <sup>24</sup> And when he was in his iourney, in the inne, our Lord mette him, and would haue killed him. <sup>25</sup> Sephora by & by tooke a very sharp stone, and circumcided the prepuce of her sonne, & touched his feete, and sayd: A bloudie spouse thou art to me. <sup>26</sup> And he let him goe after she had said, A bloudie spouse thou art to me, because of the circumcision. <sup>27</sup> And our Lord said to Aaron: Goe into the desert to meete Moyses. Who went forth to meete him vnto the Mountaine of God, and kissed him. <sup>28</sup> And Moyses told Aaron al the wordes of our Lord, by which he had sent him, & the signes that he had commanded. <sup>29</sup> And they came together, and gathered together al the ancientes of the children of Israel. <sup>30</sup> And Aaron spake al the wordes which our Lord had said to Moyses: and he wrought the signes before the people, <sup>31</sup> and the people beleued. And they heard that our Lord had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked vpon their affliction: & they adored prostrate.

For without good proofe both the Israelites, and Ã†gyptians might haue reiected him, as seming to come of his owne priuate spirit, being no ordinarie superior, neither of the whole people, nor of his owne tribe, nor first of his familie; for Aaron was his elder brother.
