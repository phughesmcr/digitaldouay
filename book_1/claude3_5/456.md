And so this promise was first performed in Iosue, succeeding next after Moyses in gouernment. And as neede required God ceased not to send more prophetes besides their ordinarie Priestes. Againe this place is also vnderstood of Christ our Sauiour, chief Prophete, and master of al prophetes; S. Peter so expounding it; *Act. 3. v. 22. & 23.*

## Chap. XIX.

*Certaine cities of refuge must be assigned for casual manslaughter. 11. Wilful morther punished by death without remission, 15. so it be conuinced by two or three witnesses. 16. False witnesses punished with the paine, which the crime obiected deserueth.*
