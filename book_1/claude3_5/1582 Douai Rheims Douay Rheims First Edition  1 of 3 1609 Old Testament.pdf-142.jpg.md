which is not in my power, or that he hath not delivered to
me, beside thee, that art his wife: <sup>9</sup>how therefore can I do
this wicked thing, and sinne against my God? <sup>10</sup>With these
kinde of wordes day by day both the woman was importunate vpon the young man: and he refused the advowtrie.
<sup>11</sup>And it chanced on a certaine day, that Ioseph went into
the house, and did some businesse without anie man with
him: <sup>12</sup>and she catching the skirte of his garment, said:
Sleepe with me. who leaving the cloke in her hand, fled,
and went forth abroad. <sup>13</sup>And when the woman sawe the
garment in her handes, and her selfe to be contemned, <sup>14</sup>she
called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See he
hath brought in an Hebrew, to delude vs: he came vpon me,
for to lie with me: and when I had cried out, <sup>15</sup>and he heard
my voice, he left the cloake that I held, and fled forth. <sup>16</sup>For
an argument therfore of her credite, she reserved the cloake,
and shewed it to her husband returning home, <sup>17</sup>and said:
There came vnto me the Hebrew seruant, whom thou didest
bring hither, for to delude me: <sup>18</sup>and when he heard me
crie, he left the cloke which I held, and fled forth. <sup>19</sup>His
maister hearing these thinges, and geuing ouer light credite
to his wiues wordes, was very wrath: <sup>20</sup>and delivered Ioseph
into prison, where the kinges prisoners were kept, and he
was there shut vp. <sup>21</sup>And our Lord was with Ioseph, and
hauing mercie vpon him gaue him grace in the sight of the
chiefe of the prison. <sup>22</sup>Who delivered in his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custodie: and whatsoever was done,
was vnder him. <sup>23</sup>Neyther did himselfe knowe any thing,
hauing committed al things to him: for our Lord was with
him, and directed al his workes.
