# Genesis

<aside>Let vs therefore examine the sense, and if S. Hierome, the great scripture Doctor did rightly vnderstand it, God did speake to this effect to Cain:</aside>

<aside>The Hebrew also & Greeke text proue freewil in Cain.</aside>

<sup>16</sup> But thou shalt haue dominion ouer it, but thou ouer it. The Hebrew hath thus: ad te appetitus eius, et tu dominaberis in eum, or, ei. Vnto thee the appetite therof, and thou shalt rule ouer it. Thargum Hierosolimitanum concludeth Gods speach to Cain thus: Into thy hand I haue geuen power of thy concupiscence, and haue thou dominion therof: whether thou wilt possesse or rule it. The Greke hath thus: To thee the conuersion therof, and thou shalt rule ouer it: to wit, appetite, lust, concupiscence is vnder thy wil. Finally, al antiquitie vniuersally, and vniforme consent of Christian Doctors, and other lerned Philosophers, and reasonable men hold it for certaine and an euident truth, that man yea a sinner hath freewil. Yet Luther, the father of Protestants, so abhorred this truth, that he could not abide the very word, nor would vse it when he writ against it in his booke, Contra liberum arbitrium, Against freewil: but, De seruo arbitrio. Of seruil arbitriment. And denieth that man is in aniwise free to choose, to resolue, or determine, but in al things seruil, tyed, constrained, and compelled to whatsoeuer he doth, saith, or thinketh. Further, that man in al his actions is like to a hackney, that is, forced to goe whether the rider wil haue him. And knowing the whole world against him, shameth not to confesse, that he setteth them al at naught in respect of him selfe, concluding thus: I haue not (saith he) conferred with anie in this booke, but I haue affirmed, and I do affirme: Neither wil I that anie man iudge hereof, but I counsel al to yelde obedience. Calvin also for his part, conspireth in this' heresie with Luther, but more faintly rather wishing, then imagining that men be so madde as to flee from the name of freewil. I (saith Calvin) neither myselfe would vse this word, and would wish others, if they aske me counsel, to abstaine from it. But we wil be bold to oppose S. Hieromes reason against Luther, Calvin, al Manichees, and others that denie freewil. God made vs (saith he) with freewil, neither are we drawen by necessitie to vertues, otherwise where is necessitie, there is neither damnation nor crowne.

<aside>Freewil testified by antiquitie, vniforme consent of lerned & reasonable persons. Luther abhorred the name of freewil.</aside>

<aside>Calvin also misliketh the word freewil.</aside>

<aside>Where is necessitie there is nether reward nor punishment due.</aside>

<aside>Going forth of the Church a marke of Heretikes.</aside>

<sup>16</sup> Cain went forth It is a marke of Heretikes to make breach, and goe forth of the Church, and commonly it cometh of enuie. Some went into heresie and schisme (saith S. Cyprian) whiles they enuie Bishops, whilest one complaineth that him selfe was not rather ordained, or disdaineth to suffer an other aboue him. Herevpon heresies, herevpon schismes. Enuie moued Cain to kil his brother, because his owne workes were wicked and reiected: and his brothers iust, and esteemed. So going forth became obstinate, obdurate, and desperate in his sinne, and being reprobate of God, began a wicked Citie, opposite to the Citie of God. Wherefore Moyses, as S. Augustine noteth, intending to describe, and shew the perpetual continuance of Gods Citie, the true Church, from Adam, which he doth by the line of Seth to Noe, and so forward to his owne time, would not omit to tel also the progenie of Cain, euen to the floode, wherin al his ofspring was finally drowned and destroyed, that the true Citie of God might appeare more distinct, more conspicuous, & more renowned. And that in deede the same only (and not anie broken and interrupted companies or conuenticles) might be knowen to be the true Church of God.

<aside>Scripture hard to vnderstand.</aside>

21. I haue slaine So hard and obscure is this place, that S. Hierom required by S. Damasus Pope to expound it, dereth not affirme anie one sense for certaine, but proposing diuers, which the text may seme to beare, willeth the Pope (who was also very lerned) to examine al more at large: pursing him in mind that Origen writ his twelfth and thirteenth bookes vpon this onlie place.
