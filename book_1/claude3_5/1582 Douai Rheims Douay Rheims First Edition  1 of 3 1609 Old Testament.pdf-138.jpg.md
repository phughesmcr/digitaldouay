<aside>The least offensive cause is alleged, why Iacob loued Ioseph aboue his bretheren</aside>

1. *In his old age*] This being one cause why Iacob loued Ioseph aboue al his other sonnes, for that he was the youngest of the eleuen (for Beniamin the twelfth was yet an infant) it is alleged in holie Scripture (saith S. Chrisostom. Epist. ad Olympiam) as least offensiue to his bretheren. For a more special cause was, for his mother Rachels sake, but most principal cause of al was, for his great vertues, and mature iudgement; for which God also preferred him aboue them al, and now foreshewed the same by visions in sleepe. Which they enuying and meaning to preuent, did in dede vnwitting cooperate therto, Gods prouidence turning their euil worke to infinite good. As the same holie Ioseph truly interpreteth it to them, after their fathers death, when they iustly feared reuenge, for so great and inhumane iniuries done vnto him. chap. 50. v. 20.

<aside>Graue for hel corruptly translated.</aside>

2. *Into hel mourning.*] Protestants denying more places for soules after this life, then Heauen for the iust, and Hel for the wicked, translate the hebrew word *sheol*, *graue for hel*. Because if they should grant that Iacob, or other holie fathers of the old Testament descended into hel, they must confesse some other hel, then where the damned are tormented, whither no Christian wil say that those fathers went. If they contended only about the sense and meaning of the text, it were more tolerable, for therin they speake, according to their erroneous opinion, as they thinke. But knowing as some of them doe, that *hel* is the true word of the text, there is no sinceritie nor moral honestie in putting *graue*, in place therof. And that they know it, the second table of the Bible, printed at London 1602. witnesseth, noting for a common place, that in the 37. chap. of Genesis. v. 35 *hel is taken for graue*, therby confessing, that the true English word of the holie Scripture in that place is *hel*, but that they would haue it to signifie graue. Wherupon anie reasonable man would thinke to finde the word *hel* in the text, with some glosse to shew that graue were to be vnderstood. But in al their Editions, also in that which was printed the yeare next folowing, 1603 (wherto the same table is adioyned, they reade *graue*, and not *hel* in this place, though in some other places, they much disagree in translating the same word.

<aside>Iacob spake of hel not of graue.</aside>

As for the sense, it can not be that Iacob ment the graue: for when he said he would goe to his sonne, he supposed him to be deuoured by a wild beast, and not buried in a graue. And therfore must necessarily meane, that he would goe where he thought the soule of his sonne to be. Which was neither in heauen, for then he would rather haue ascended thither ioyful, then descended to anie place mourning; neither did he meane the hel of the damned, for that had bene desperation; but to a lowe place, where the iust soules then remained in rest, which was called *Limbus Patrum*, or Abrahams bosome. That is, saith S. Augustin, in his answer to Bishop Euodius (Epist. 99.) *secreta quadam habitatio*. The habitation of a certaine secret rest.
