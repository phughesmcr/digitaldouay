Ioseph.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XLV

<aside>The munificent and care of Priests in the law of nature. Yea amongst Infidels.</aside>

[^1] Sauing the land of the Priests.] Let them heare which now liue (saith S. Chrysostom) what great care men had in times past of the priests of idols: and let them learne at least to yeeld like honour to true priests, to whom the ministerie of al diuine offices is committed. For if the Ægyptians, in their errors, had so great care of idols, thinking them to be more honored, if their ministers were respected, how great condemnation doe they not deserue, that now diminish that, which pertaineth to the prouision of priests? Doe we not know that the honour pertaineth to God himself? Regard not therefore him to whom the honour is exhibited. For it is not for his cause to whom thou doest it, but for his sake whose priest he is, that of him thou maiest abundantly receiue rewards. Wherefore he said: *He that doth it to one of these, hath done it for me: & he that receiueth a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shal receiue the reward of a prophet.* Wilt thou not reward thee according to the worthines or meannes of his ministers? According to thine owne alacritie, he either crowneth or condemneth. &c. I say not this for the priests sakes, but for yours, desiring to gaine you in al things. For in lieu of that litle you geue, you shal receiue immortal rewards, and vnspeakeable good. Let vs consider these things, and haste to serue them, not looking vpon the cost, but vpon the gaine, and increase that riseth therof. &c. For whatsoeuer you bestow vpon Gods priests, he accounteth it as bestowed on himself. And he that so bestoweth, shal not only receiue like retribution, but manifold greater: our merciful God, alwayes of the abundance of his mercie, exceeding the things which are done by vs. Let vs not therefore be worse then infidels, who for the error of idols gaue so much to their seruants; for how much error and truth do differ, so much difference is there, betwen theirs and Gods Priests. Thus much and something more writeth S. Chrisostom vpon this place.

<aside>Cohen in some place signifieth Prince, but is here translated Priest, as in the English Bibles.</aside>

[^2] Priests] The Hebrew word Cohanim is here vniuersally translated Priests, in al languages and Editions: which (chap. 40. v. 45.) some translate Princes and more probably (2. Reg. 8. v. vlt.) where Dauids sonnes are called Cohanim: who were in dede Princes, and not properly Priests. But in this present place it signifieth those, to whom Pharao alowed particular prouision in the time of dearth, which al vnderstand of Priests, and not of Princes.
