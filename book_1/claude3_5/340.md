# THE ARGVMENT OF THE BOOKE OF NVMERI.

<aside>Mysteries cõ-teined in these histories.</aside>

IN this booke called Numeri, are conteined (saith S. Hierom) the Mysteries of al Arithmetike, or numbering, of the Prophecie of Balaam, and of the fourtie two Mansions of the Israelites, in the desert. *Which mystical sense the same great Doctor, as also S. Augustin and other Fathers do gather of the literal, written by Moyses. Who here prosecuteth the sacred historie after Genesis and Exodus* (Leuiticus also conteining one moneth) *from the second moneth of the second yeare, after the deliuerie of the Israelites out of Ægypt, nere 39. yeares, to the last of Moyses life. First ther-fore he reporteth how al the men of twelue tribes, of the age of twentie yeares and vpward, were numbered. Likewise the tribe of Leui was numbered and imployed pertly in priestly function, the rest to assist the priests. He describeth also the order of marching and encamping, the Leuites alwayes next and round about the Tabernacle: the other twelue tribes in circuite of them on al sides. He moreouer recordeth certaine notable murmurings, tumultes, schismes, and rebellions with the euents therof, and miserable endes of chief seducers. Whose great iniuries Moyses meekely sustained with singular patience, stil executing his owne function with heroical fortitude. Among which, diuers precepts and lawes are partly repeated partly added, as wel concerning Religion and Gods seruice, as godlie policie and ciuil gouernment of the people, with chastisment of offenders. How also their enemies endeuoured to annoy them, Balac king of Moab procuring Balaam the sorcerer, so much as in him lay, to curse them; but al in vaine. Yet by carnal fornication manie were drawen to spiritual. Both which being punished God againe prospered his people, in diuers encounters and battailes against Infidels. Finally the promised Land of Chanaan on both sides Iordaine is described by limites, which they shal parte a-mongst them by lotte, the Leuites mingled in euerie tribe, with their appoin-ted cities and commodities for habitation, and the uthes, first fruites, obla-tions and abundant prouision for their maintenance. Cities also of refuge are designed for casual manslayers: and a law established that al shal marie within their owne tribes, to auoide confusion of inheritances.*

<aside>Three partes of this booke.</aside>

So this booke may be deuided into three partes. In the first the principal and most perfect sort of the people are numbered, and disposed in order according to diuers states and offices, before they depart from the desert of Sinai, in the nine first chapters. Then are related sundrie thinges, which happened vnto them in the rest of their iourney, especially manie and great impediments, through al which God punishing some, brought the residue to enter the promised land. from the 10. chap. to the end of the 33. Lastly the countrie of Chanaan is againe promised, with order so to possesse and enioy it, that euerie tribe may haue and keepe their seueral partes, in the three last chapters.
