# Leviticus

<sup>1</sup> Our Lord said also to Moses: Speak to the priests the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say to them: Let not a priest be contaminated in the deathes of his citizens, <sup>2</sup> but only in his kinne, and nigh of bloud, that is to say, upon his father and mother, and sonne, and daughter, brother also, <sup>3</sup> and sister being a virgin which hath not bene maried to a husband: <sup>4</sup> but neither in the prince of his people shal he be contaminated. <sup>5</sup> Neither shal they shaue their head, nor beard, nor make incisions in their flesh. <sup>6</sup> They shal be holie to their God, and shal not pollute his name: for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord, and breades of their God doe they offer, and therfore they shal be holie. <sup>7</sup> A whore and a vile strumpette he shal not take to wife, nor her, that is put away from her husband: because they are consecrated to their God, <sup>8</sup> and offer the breades of proposition. Be they holie therfore, because I also am holie, the Lord, that sanctifie them. <sup>9</sup> The daughter of a priest if she be taken in whordome, & dishonour the name of hir father, shal be burnt with fire. <sup>10</sup> The grand bishoppe, that is to say the priest that is greatest among his brethren, vpon whose head hath bene poured the oyle of vnction, and whose handes were consecrated in priesthood, and who was reuested with the holie vestimentes, shal not vncouer his head, he shal not rent his garmentes: <sup>11</sup> and to no dead person shal he enter in at al, vpon his father also, and mother shal he not be contaminated. <sup>12</sup> Neither shal he goe forth out of the holie places, lest he pollute the Sanctuarie of the Lord, because the oyle of the holie vnction of his God is vpon him. I the Lord. <sup>13</sup> He shal take a virgin vnto his wife: <sup>14</sup> but a widow and her that is put away, and a filth, and a whore he shal not take, but a maide of his owne people: <sup>15</sup> that he mingle not the stocke of his kinred with the common people of his nation: because I am the Lord that sanctifie him. <sup>16</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>17</sup> Speake to Aaron: The man of thy seede throughout their families, that hath a blemish, shal not offer breades to his God, <sup>18</sup> neither shal he approch to his ministerie: If he be blinde, if lame, if he haue a litle, or a great, or a crooked nose, <sup>19</sup> if his foote be broken, if his hand, <sup>20</sup> if he be crooke backed, or blere eyed, or haue a pearle in his eye, or a continual scabbe, or drie scurffe in his bodie, or be burnt. <sup>21</sup> Euerie one that hath a blemish
