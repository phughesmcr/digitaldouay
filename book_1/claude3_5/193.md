of Egypt. EXODVS. 171

cometh worse and worse, desperate and obdurate, at last the father or master
saith: I have made thee thus bad as thou art I by sparing thee and suffering
thee to have thine owne pleasure, have nourished thy perversities, and care-
lesnes: yet he saith not this, as though by his wil and intention, but by his
goodnes and gentlenes the man became so wicked. It may here be demanded
againe: why did not our Lord so mercifully punish Pharao, as wholy to re-
clame him, for it semeth that had bene greater mercie? and God dealeth so
with some, why doth he not with al, that al might be saued? First it is most
iustly and rightly ascribed to their iniquities, which deserue to be indurate:
againe why this sinner is reclaimed, and not an other of the same il deserts, is
to be referred to Gods inscrutable iudgements, which are often secrete, neuer
vniust. Let it therfore suffice piously and humbly to beleue, that as Moyses
testifieth, *God is faithful and without iniquitie, iust and right*: and as the royal
Prophet also professeth, *Thou art not a God that wilt iniquitie*, and as the Apostle
teacheth, *there is no iniquitie with God*. By al which and some more to the same
effect (which we omit) S. Augustin concludeth againe, that properly Pharao
hardened his owne hart, God only by bestowing benefites vpon him, which he
abused, and not plaguing him so much, as he deserued, but letting him liue,
and reigne, and persecute the Church for the time, vntil he and al his armie
were in the middes of the sea. Whither (as the same lerned father noteth
(ser. 88.) their owne desperate boldnes drew them, vaine furie through their
owne madnes prouoking them to goe so farre, where God not working, but
only ceasing to continue his miracle, the waters returning to their owne na-
ture, and meeting together inuolued and drowned them al.

Other like expositions the same lerned father hath in other places. As, q. 18.
*super Exodum*, he teacheth that Pharao being already so wicked through his
owne fault, other things were done to him and his people, which partly were
to the correction of others, and might haue bene to his, but he abusing al,
became worse & worse, by Gods suffering and dispensation, *not only for his iust,
but withal for his powerful wil*. Li. 5. cont. Iulian c. 3 touching the ground of cer-
taine he allegeth the Apostle saying: *Perceiue not thou of his owne vessels of
wrath, prepared and adiusted*: but touching one kind of Gods punishing some
that are ouerwhelmed in obstinate sinnes, he allegeth the saying of an other
Apostle. *God hath deliuered them into passions of ignominie*; and into a reprobate sense,
*to do those things that are not conuenient*, for God deliuereth them (saith he) conue-
niently: that the same sinnes are made both punishments of sinnes past, and are
deserts of punishments to come. Yet he maketh not the willes euil, but vseth
the euil as he wil, who can not wil anie thing vniustly. Againe, q. 24. It appea-
reth (saith he) that the causes of induration of Pharaoes hart, were not only for
that his Inchanters did like things (to those which Moyses and Aaron did) but
the very patience of God, by which he spared him. Gods patience according to
mens hartes is profitable to some to repentance, to some vnprofitable to resist
God, & persist in euil: yet not of it selfe vnprofitable, but through the euil hart.
Briefly. q. 36. *I haue hardned Pharaoes hart*, that is, I haue bene patient ouer him
and his seruants. Epist. 105. God doth not indurate by impering malice, but
by not impering mercie [or grace] *Li. de Praedest. c. 4. God is sayd to
indurate him, whom he wil not mollifie*. So to make him blinde whom he
wil not illuminate. So also to repel him, whom he wil not cal. And c. 6. what is
that to say: *I wil indurate his hart*, but I wil not mollifie it? 149. 14. It ought to
haue auailed Pharao to saluation, that Gods patience deferring his iust and
deserued punishment, multiplied vpon him frequent signes of miracles, *conui-*
