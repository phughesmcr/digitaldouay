<sup>7</sup> the fourteenth day of this moneth: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shal sacrifice him at euen. <sup>8</sup> And they shal take of the bloud thereof, and put vpon both the postes, and on the vpper doore postes of the houses, wherein they shal eate him. <sup>9</sup> And they shal eate the flesh that night rosted at the fire, and vnleauened bread with wilde lettice. You shal not eate thereof any thing raw, nor boyled in water, but only rosted at the fire: the head with the feete and entrailes thereof you shal deuoure. <sup>10</sup> Neither shal there remaine any thing of him vntil morning. If there be any thing left, you shal burne it with fire. <sup>11</sup> And thus you shal eate him: you shal gird your reynes, and you shal haue shoes on your feete, holding staues in your handes, and you shal eate speedely: for it is the Phase (that is the Passage) of the Lord. <sup>12</sup> And I wil passe through the Land of Aegypt that night, and wil strike euery first begotten in the Land of Aegypt from man euen vnto beast: and in al the goddes of Aegypt I wil doe iudgements, I the Lord. <sup>13</sup> And the bloud shal be vnto you for a signe in the houses where you shal be: and I shal see the bloud, and shal passe ouer you: neither shal there be among you a destroying plague when I shal strike the Land of Aegypt. <sup>14</sup> And you shal haue this day for a moniment: and you shal celebrate it solemne to the Lord in your generations with an euerlasting obseruation. <sup>15</sup> Seuen dayes shal you eate azimes: in the first day there shal be noe leauen in your houses: whosoeuer shal eate leauen, that soule shal perish out of Israel, from the first day vntil the seuenth day. <sup>16</sup> The first day shal be holie and solemne, and the seuenth day with the like festiuitie shal be venerable: no worke shal you doe in them, except those thinges, that pertaine to eating. <sup>17</sup> And you shal obserue the azymes: for in the selfe same day I wil bring forth your armie out of the Land of Aegypt, and you shal keepe this day vnto your generations with a perpetual rite. <sup>18</sup> The first moneth, the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen you shal eate azymes vntil the one and twentith day of the same moneth at euen. <sup>19</sup> Seuen dayes there shal not be found leauened in your houses: he that shal eate leauened, his soule shal perish out of the assemblie of Israel, as wel of strangers as of them that are borne in the land. <sup>20</sup> Nothing leauened shal you eate: in al your habitations you shal eate azymes.
