Genesis.

Thus mankind being diuided vpon the earth, opinions also were multiplied concerning Religion. For shortly the perswation of mens trusting in themselues, and in other mortal men appeared absurde, euen the strongest feeling aduersities, or fayling sometimes of their purposes, saw there was neede of supernal helpe, and that earthlie things depended much vpon diuine wil and powre. But hauing forsaken God Almightie, the onlie maker and conseruer of al, they begane to imagine and serue false goddes, both famous dead men, which had prospered in this world, and diuers other things, by which they receiued commoditie, or feared damage.

Hence therfore rose the third principal Sect called Grecisme, beginning also in this second age, as the same S. Epiphanius writeth. For Ninus the first king of the Assyrian great Monarchie, brought to passe that his father Belus Iupiter was esteemed and worshipped for the onlie great God by the Assyrians. To him the Babylonians erected first Temples Altares and Statues. Nemrod also by the name of Saturnus, as the progenitor of Belus, and first great King or Tyrant of Babylon, was accounted a god, and the father of goddes. About this time likewise begane the Dinastie among the Egyptians, and not sooner, as they vainly brag to haue benne before the floud: yea much longer than in deede the world hath benne. Moreouer the Chaldees worshipped the fire. Others the sunne, the moone, and innumerable other fained goddes. Against al which (and likewise against al heresies) are two special arguments. First that they were not from the beginning, as the true God, and al truthes are knowne and receiued by continual Tradition, but brought in afterwards by men, and commonly by il men. Secondly they are not accepted and esteemed for goddes, or truthes, in al places, but with great diuersitie and dissention, one sort allowing that others despise, as holie Athanasius notably writeth in his oration against Idols in these wordes. Quot sunt gentes tot illorum deorum genera constituunt &c. How manie nations (saith he) so manie kindes of goddes are framed. Also the same countries, the same cities dissenting within it selfe in superstition of Idols. The Phenicians certis acknowledge not the Egyptians goddes, neither do the Egyptians adore the same Idols with the Phenicians: Nor the Scithians receiue the goddes of the Persians, nor the Persians of the Scithians: The Pelasgie refuse the Thrasian goddes, the Thrasians know not the Thebians. The Indians are against the Arabians, the Arabians against the Ethiopians: and in like sorte the Ethiopians differ in their religious affaires from the Arabians. The Syrians worship not the goddes of the Cilicians, and the nations of Capadocia besides al these haue goddes of other names. The Bithinians also framed diuers goddes, the Armenians againe diuers from them. What nede we manie wordes? Those that are in the continent honour other goddes from the Iland-people. In briefe ech citie and ech village not knowing the goddes of their neigh-
