# Of Moyses the Avthor of the fiue first bookes.

<aside>Moyses. signifieth, taken from the water.</aside>

Moyses (so called because he was taken from the water, as the name signifieth) was borne in Ægypt, the sonne of Amram, the sonne of Caath, the sonne of Leui the Patriarch, and so of Iacob, Isaac, and Abraham. His maruelous deliuerie from drowning, his education, excellent formes, singular wisdome, heroical vertues, rare dexteritie in al affayres, & whole life most admirable, are gathered out of holie Scriptures, by S. Gregorie Bishop of Nissen, into a briefe Summe, most worthie to be read, but to large for this place. He was borne about the yeare of the world two thousand and foure hundred, long before al prophane writers, yea before manie of the Painimes false goddes, as S. Augustine declareth in diuers places of his most excellent booke intituled of the Citie of God. He liued in this world 110. yeares. Of which 40. were in Pharaos court, as the adopted sonne of Pharaos daughter: fourtie in banishment from Ægypt in Madian: and fourtie more he gouerned the people of Israel. His singular prayses are also briefly touched in the last chapter of Deuteronomie, added by Iosue, and in the booke of Ecclesiasticus.

<aside>The excellencie of Moyses</aside>

<aside>His sepulchre not knowen to anie man.</aside>

He died in the desert, and was buried in the vale of Moab, so secretly that no man euer knew his sepulchre, lest the Iewes, who were very prone to Idolatrie, should haue adored his bodie with diuine honour, for the greatnes and multitude of his miracles, and for the singular estimation, they had of him for the same.
