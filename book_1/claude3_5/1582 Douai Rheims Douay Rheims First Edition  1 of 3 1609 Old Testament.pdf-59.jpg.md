God and euerie liuing soule of al flesh which is vpon the
earth. <sup>17</sup> And God said to Noe: This shal be the signe of the
couenant, which I established, betwen me & al flesh of the
earth. <sup>18</sup> The sonnes therfore of Noe, that came out of the
arke, were Sem, Cham, and Iaphet: and Cham he is the father of Chanaan. <sup>19</sup> These three are the sonnes of Noe: and
of these was al mankind spred ouer the whole earth.
<sup>20</sup> And Noe a husbandman began to till the grounde, and
planted a vineyard. <sup>21</sup> And drinking of the wine was made
drunke, and naked in his tabernacle. <sup>22</sup> Which when
Cham the father of Chanaan, had seene, to wit that his fathers priuities were bare, he told it to his two bretheren
abroad. <sup>23</sup> But in dede Sem and Iapheth put a cloake vpon
their shoulders, and going backward, couered the priuities
of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they
saw not their fathers priuities. <sup>24</sup> And Noe awaking from
the wine, when he had learned what his younger sonne had
done to him, <sup>25</sup> he said: "Cursed be Chanaan, a seruant of seruants shal he be vnto his bretheren. <sup>26</sup> And he said: Blessed
be the Lord God of Sem, Chanaan be his seruant. <sup>27</sup> God
enlarge Iapheth, and dwel he in the tabernacles of Sem, and
Chanaan be his seruant. <sup>28</sup> And Noe liued after the floud
three hundred fiftie yeres. <sup>29</sup> And al his dayes were in the
whole nyne hundred fiftie yeares: and he died.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. IX.

[^1] *Al that moueth*] S. Iustinus Martyr, S. Chrisostom, and other ancient Doctors proue, that flesh was lawful to be eaten before the floud: but being not necessarie, because men were stronger, and other things also of more force, the better sorte which were of Seths race abstained from it. But after the floud flesh being more necessarie, God licensed the custome of abstinence, with this limitation and commandment, that they shal not eate bloud.

[^2] *Not with bloud*] Though this positiue precept, of not eating bloud, serued wel to make men more abhorre manslaughter (which is forbid by the law of nature, and the reuenge therof here and in other places seuerely threatened) yet it was specially geuen both immediatly after the floud, and in the law of Moyses (with manie the like) to exercise men in obedience. And the same was renewed, for a time, by the Apostles, to appease a controuersie in the primitiue Church. For that the Iewes conuerted to Christ, hauing beene long accustomed to this obseruation, could not induce to see it broken, by them selues, or other Christians, and being no great burden, for the Gentiles,
