appeareth sufficiently by that Sarai perswaded her owne husband, to marie an
other wife, and he a true seruant of God agreed thereto, not as a new thing but
as a lawful practise of those times. And Moyses here and in other places stil
speaketh of it, as of a custome knowne to the people for lawful. *If a man* (saith
he) *haue two wiues, one beloued and the other hated, and they haue children by him,
and the sonne of the hated be first borne, he can not preferre the sonne of the beloued*:
wherby it clere that two wiues were then lawful, and the children of both
legitimate, and that the first borne must be preferred, without respect of
first or last mariage. Yet this dispensation either ceased before Christs time, the
cause ceasing, when the world was replenished; or at least our Sauiour tooke
it away, restoring Matrimonie to the first institution of two in one flesh. who

CHAP. XVII.

*God renewing his promises to Abram, 5. changeth his name, 10. and com-
mandeth Circumcision. 15. changeth also his wiues name, promiseth a sonne
of her. 20. Likewise that Ismael shal prosper. 23. and the same day Abra-
ham circumcised him selfe, and Ismael, and al the men of his house.*

<sup>1</sup> AND after that he beganne to be nyntie and nyne yeares
old, our Lord appeared vnto him: and said vnto him:
I am the God almightie: walke before me, and be :: perfect.
<sup>2</sup> And I wil make my couenant betwen me and thee: and
<sup>3</sup> I wil multiplie thee exceedingly. † Abram fel flat on his
<sup>4</sup> face. † And God said to him: I am, and my couenant is
<sup>5</sup> with thee, & thou shalt be a father of manie nations. † Ney-
ther shal thy name be called any more Abram: but thou
shalt be called Abraham: because a father of *many nations*
<sup>6</sup> I haue made thee. † And I wil make thee encrease exceeding-
ly, and I wil make thee into nations, and kinges shal come
<sup>7</sup> forth of thee. † And I wil establish my couenant betwen
me and thee, and betwen thy seede after thee in their gene-
rations by a perpetual couenant: to be thy God, and thy
<sup>8</sup> seede after thee. † And I wil geue to thee, and to thy seed
the land of thy peregrination, al the land of Chanaan for a
<sup>9</sup> perpetual possession, and I wil be their God. † Againe God
said to Abraham: And thou therfore shalt keepe my coue-
<sup>10</sup> nant, and thy seed after thee in their generations. † This is
my couenant which you shal obserue betwen me and you,
