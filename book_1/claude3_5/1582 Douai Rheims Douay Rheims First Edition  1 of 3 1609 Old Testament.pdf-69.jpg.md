# Genesis

Thus mankind being divided upon the earth, opinions also were multiplied concerning Religion. For shortly the persuasion of mens trusting in themselves, and in other mortal men appeared absurde, euen the strongest feeling aduersities, or sayling sometimes of their purpose, saw there was neede of supernal helpe, and that their felicitie depended much upon diuine wil and power. But hauing forsaken God Almightie, the onlie maker and conseruer of al, they begane to imagine and serue false goddes, both famous dead men, which had prospered in this world, and diuers other things, by which they receiued commoditie, or feared damage.

Here therefore rose the third principal Sect called Grecisme, beginning also in this second age, as the same S. Epiphanius writeth. For Ninus the first king of the Assyrian great Monarchie, brought to passe that his father Belus Iupiter was estemed and worshipped for the onlie great God by the Assyrians. To him the Babylonians erected first Temples, Altares and Statues. Nemrod also by the name of Saturnus, as the progenitor of Belus, and first great King or Tyrant of Babylon, was accounted a god, and the father of goddes.

About this time likewise begane the Dinastie among the Ægyptians, and not sowner, as they vainly brag to haue benne before the floud: yea much longer then in deede the world hath benne. Moreouer the Chaldees worshipped the fire. Others the sunne, the moone, and innumerable other feaned goddes.

Against al which (and likewise against al heresies) are two special arguments. First that they were not from the beginning, as the true God, and al truthes are knowne and reteyned by continual Tradition, but brought in afterwards by men, and comonly by il men. Secondly they are not accepted and obserued for goddes, or truthes, in al places, but with great diuersitie and dissention, one sort allowing that others despise, as holie Athanasius notably writeth in his oration against Idols in these wordes: *Quot sunt gentes totidem deorum genera confinguntur &c. How manie nations* (saith he) *so manie kindes of goddes are feaned. Also the same imagined goddes dissent within it selfe in superstition of Idols. The Phenicians certis acknowledge not the Ægyptians goddes, neither doe the Ægyptians adore the same Idols with the Phenicians: Nor the Scithians receiue the goddes of the Persians, nor the Persians of the Scithians: The Pelasgies refuse the Thrasian goddes, the Thrasians know not the Thebans. The Indians are against the Arabians, the Arabians against the Æthiopians: and in like sorte the Æthiopians differ in their religious affaires from the Arabians. The Syrians worship not the goddes of the Cilicians, and the nations of Capadocia besides al these haue other goddes of their owne. The Bithinians also feaned diuers goddes, the Armenians againe diuers from them. What neede we manie wordes? Those that are in the continent honor other goddes from the Iland-people. In briefe ech citie and ech village not knowing the goddes of their neigh-*
