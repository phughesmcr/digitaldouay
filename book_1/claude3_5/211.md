<sup>9</sup> me when I came forth out of Egypt. † And it shal be as a signe in thy hand, and as a monument before thine eyes: and that the law of our Lord be alwayes in thy mouth, for in a strong hand our Lord hath brought thee out of Egypt.

<sup>10</sup> Thou shalt keepe this obseruation at the sette time from dayes to dayes. <sup>11</sup> And when our Lord shal haue brought thee into the Land of the Chananeite, as he sware to thee and thy fathers, and shal geue it thee: <sup>12</sup> thou shalt separate al that openeth the matrice vnto our Lord, and al that is brought forth in thy cattel: whatsoeuer thou shalt haue of male sexe thou shalt consecrate to our Lord. <sup>13</sup> The first borne of an asse thou shal change for a sheepe: and if thou doe not redeeme it, thou shalt kil it. And euerie first borne of men among thy children, thou shalt redemne with a price. <sup>14</sup> And when thy sonne shal aske thee to morow, saying: What is this? thou shalt answere him: With a strong hand did our Lord bring vs forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of seruitude.

<sup>15</sup> For when Pharaoes hart was indurate, and would not dismisse vs, our Lord slew euerie first-borne in the Land of Egypt, from the first-borne of man to the first borne of beastes: therfore I sacrifice to our Lord al that openeth the matrice of the male fixe, and al the first borne of my sonnes I doe redeme. <sup>16</sup> It shal be therfore as a signe in thy hand, and as a thing hanged before thine eyes, for a remembrance: because our Lord by a strong hand hath brought vs forth out of Egypt. <sup>17</sup> Therfore when Pharao had sent forth the people, our Lord ledde them not by the way of the Philisthijns countrie which is neere: thinking lest perhappes it would repent them, if they should see warres arise against them, and would returne into Egypt. <sup>18</sup> But he ledde them about by the way of the desert, which is besides the Red-sea: and the children <sup>19</sup> of Israel went vp out of the Land of Egypt armed. † Moyses also tooke Iosephes bones with him: because he had adiured the children of Israel, saying: God shal visite you, carrie <sup>20</sup> out my bones from hence with you. † And marching from Socoth they camped in Etham in the vtmost coastes of the <sup>21</sup> wildernesse. † And our Lord went before them to shew the way by day in a piller of a cloude, and by night in a piller of fire: that he might be the guide of their iourney both times. <sup>22</sup> There neuer failed the piller of the cloude by day, nor the piller of fire by night, before the people.

[^1]: In the Hebrew, *when pharao had indurated him selfe*.

<aside>By this appeareth how much Moyses esteemed Iosephs charge concerning translation of his bones. Also S. Paul commendeth it. *Heb. 11.*</aside>
