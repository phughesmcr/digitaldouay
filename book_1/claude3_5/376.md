stand before the ful assemblie of the people, and should mini-
ster to him? <sup>10</sup> did he therfore make thee and al thy brethren
the sonnes of Leui to approch vnto him, that you should
chalenge vnto you the priesthood also, <sup>11</sup> and al thy compa-
nie should stand against our Lord? for what is Aaron that you
murmur against him? <sup>12</sup> Moyses therfore sent to cal Dathan
and Abiron the sonnes of Eliab. Who answered: We come
not. <sup>13</sup> Why, is it a smal matter to thee that thou hast brought
vs out of a land, that flowed with milke and honie, to kil
vs in the desert, vnles thou rule also like a lord ouer vs?
<sup>14</sup> In deede hast thou brought vs into a land, that floweth
with riuers of milke and honie, & hast thou geuen vs possessi-
ons of fieldes & vineyardes? What, wilt thou plucke out our
eies also? We come not. <sup>15</sup> Moyses therfore being very wrath,
said to our Lord: Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest
that I haue not taken of them so much as a litle asse at anie
time, neither haue afflicted anie of them. <sup>16</sup> And he said to
Core: Thou, and al thy congregation stand ye apart before
our Lord, and Aaron to morrow apart. <sup>17</sup> Take euerie one
your censars, and put incense vpon them, offering to our
Lord two hundred fiftie censars: Let Aaron also hold his cen-
sar. <sup>18</sup> Which when they had done, Moyses and Aaron stand-
ing, <sup>19</sup> and had heaped together al the multitude against them
to the dore of the tabernacle, the glorie of our Lord appeared
to them al. <sup>20</sup> And our Lord speaking to Moyses and Aaron,
said: <sup>21</sup> Separate your selues from the middes of this congre-
gation, that I may sodenly destroy them. <sup>22</sup> Who fel flatte on
their face, and said: Most mightie God of the spirites of al
flesh, when one sinneth, shal thy wrath rage against al?
<sup>23</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses: <sup>24</sup> Command the whole
people that they separate them selues from the tabernacles
of Core and Dathan and Abiron. <sup>25</sup> And Moyses arose, and
went to Dathan and Abiron: and the ancientes of Israel fo-
lowing him, <sup>26</sup> he said to the multitude: Depart from the ta-
bernacles of the impious men, and touch not the thinges
that pertaine to them, lest you be wrapped in their sinnes.
<sup>27</sup> And when they were departed from their tentes round a-
bout, Dathan and Abiron coming forth stood in the entrie
of their pauilions with their wiues and children, and al the
multitude. <sup>28</sup> And Moyses said: In this you shal know
that our Lord hath sent me to do al thinges that you see, and
