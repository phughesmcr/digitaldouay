Ceremonies. Exodvs.

Priest, and of his sonnes, to do the function of Priesthood <sup>20</sup> vnto me. And al the multitude of the children of Israel <sup>21</sup> going forth from the sight of Moyses, offered first fruites to our Lord with a most prompt and deuoute minde, to make the worke of the tabernacle of the testimonie. Whatsoeuer was necessarie to the seruice therof and to the holie vesti- <sup>22</sup> ments, both men and women did giue, tablettes and earlettes, ringes and bracelettes: euerie vessel of gold was <sup>23</sup> separated for the donaries of our Lord. If anie man had hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twise died redde, and fine <sup>24</sup> linnen, goates heare, and rammes skinnes died redde, and iacinth <sup>25</sup> skinnes, metal of siluer and brasse, they offered to our Lord, and the wood setim for diuers vses. But the skilful <sup>26</sup> women also gaue such thinges as they had sponne, hyacinth, purple, and scarlet, and silke, and goates haire, geuing al <sup>27</sup> of their owne accord. But the princes offered onyx stones, and pretious stones, for the Ephod and the Rationale, <sup>28</sup> and spices and oile to maintaine the lightes, and for the preparing of ointment, and to make the incense of most <sup>29</sup> sweete sauour. Al men and women with deuoute mind offered donaries, that the workes might be made which our Lord had comanded by the hand of Moyses. Al the children of Israel did dedicate voluntarie thinges to our Lord.

<sup>30</sup> And Moyses said to the children of Israel: Behold, our Lord hath :: called by name Beseleel the sonne of Vri <sup>31</sup> the sonne of Hur of the tribe of Iuda. And hath filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdome and intelligence, <sup>32</sup> and science and al learning to deuise and to make worke <sup>33</sup> in gold and siluer, and brasse, and in grauing stones, and in carpenters worke. Whatsoeuer can be deuised arti- <sup>34</sup> ficially, he hath giuen in his hart: Ooliab also the sonne <sup>35</sup> of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan: both hath he instru- cted with wisdome, to make the workes of a carpenter, a tapester, an embroderer of hyacinth and purple, and scarlet twisedied, and silke, and to weaue al thinges, and to inuent al new things.

[^1]: As matter alone is not sufficient for a building without artificers, to whom God geueth special skill: so for expounding holie Scripture God geueth particular knowledge to Pastors and Doctors, to the consummation of Sainctes, to the worke of the ministerie, to the edifying of the bodie of Christ.
