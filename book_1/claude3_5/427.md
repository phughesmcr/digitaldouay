nation so great, that hath goddes approching vnto them, as
our God is present at al our petitions. <sup>8</sup> For what other
nation is there so renowned that hath the ceremonies, and
iust iudgementes, and the whole law, which I wil sette
forth this day before your eyes. <sup>9</sup> Keepe thy selfe therfore,
and thy soule carefully. Forget not the wordes, that thyne
eyes haue seene, and let them not fal out of thy hart al
the daies of thy life. Thou shalt teach them thy sonnes and
thy nephewes, <sup>10</sup> the day wherin thou didst stand before
the Lord thy God in Horeb, when our Lord spake to me,
saying: Assemble vnto me the people, that they may heare
my wordes, and may learne to feare me al the time that they
liue on the earth, and may teach their children. <sup>11</sup> And you
came to the foote of the mount, which burned euen vnto
heauen: and there was in it darkenes, and a cloud and mist.
<sup>12</sup> And our Lord spake to you from the middes of the fyre.
The voice of his wordes you heard, and forme you saw not
at al. <sup>13</sup> And he shewed you his couenant, which he com-
manded you to do, and the tenne wordes, that he wrote in
two tables of stone. <sup>14</sup> And he cõmanded me at that time that
I should teach you the ceremonies and iudgementes, which
you should doe in the Land, that you shal possesse. <sup>15</sup> Keepe
therfore your soules carefully. You saw not any similitude
in the day, that our Lord spake to you in Horeb from the
middes of the fire: <sup>16</sup> lest perhaps deceiued you might make
you a grauen similitude, or image of male or female, <sup>17</sup> the
similitude of al cattel, that are vpon the earth, or of birdes,
that flie vnder heauen, <sup>18</sup> and of creeping beastes, that moue
on the earth, or of fishes, that vnder the earth abide in the
waters: <sup>19</sup> lest perhappes lifting vp thyne eies to heauen, thou
see the Sunne and the Moone, and al the starres of heauen,
and deceiued by errour thou adore and serue them, which
the Lord thy God created to serue al nations, that are vnder
heauen. <sup>20</sup> But you our Lord hath taken, and brought out
of the yron furnace of Ægypt, to haue you his people by in-
heritance, as it is this present day. <sup>21</sup> And our Lord was an-
grie with me for your wordes, and he sware that I should
not passe ouer Iordan, nor enter into the excellent Land,
which he wil geue you. <sup>22</sup> Behold I die in this ground,
I shal not passe ouer Iordan: you shal passe, and possesse the
goodlie Land. <sup>23</sup> Beware lest at any time thou forget the
couenant
