CHAP. XLVIII.

<aside>The right had also in spiritual things, preferred before the left.</aside>

[^1] 14. *stretching forth his right hand*,] As nature hath made the right hand readier to moue, stronger to worke and resist, and apter to frame and fashion anie thing, so generally we vse it more then the left. And when we vse both handes at once, we ordinarily applie the right hand to the greater, and more excellent effect, both in spiritual and corporal things. As in confirmation of fidelitie or frendship, in blessing, writing, fighting, playing, and in most other things, we vse the right hand, either only or chiefly. So the Patriarch Iacob laide his right hand vpon Ephraim, knowing by prophetical spirit, that he should be preferred, before his elder brother Manasses. Literally fulfilled in Iosue, Ieroboam, and other chief Princes of Ephraims issue. And mystically in the Gentils, being later called of God, and yet preferred before the Iewes.[^2]

<aside>The younger preferred before the elder in the Gentils before the Iewes.</aside>

[^3] 14. *Changing handes*] The mysterie, of the Gentils excelling the Iewes in time of grace, was prefiguratiuely prefigured the younger brother before the elder (Abel before Cain; Abraham before Nachor; Isaac before Ismael; Iacob himself before Esau; and now Ephraim before Manasses) is here further represented by Iacob forming of a crosse, with his armes laied one ouer the other, when he blessed his two nephewes: who otherwise might haue blessed his right hand vpon the one, and his left vpon the other; or haue caused them to change places; but he wittingly crossed his armes, and *changed his handes*: or according to the Hebrew, *made his handes wittingly*, that is, by his handes made it to be vnderstood, not only that the younger should be in place of the elder, Ephraim before Manasses, and much more the Gentiles before the Iewes, but also, that this greater Mysterie should be effected by Christ dying on a Crosse. For what els could the true crossing of his armes, so wittingly and purposly done, signifie, but the forme and figure of Christs Crosse? As else where God commanded young Isaac caried on his back vnto the mountaine prefigured the matter of the same Crosse. Al accomplished when Christ was crucified: wherby the Iewes were scandalized, and the Gentiles called and saued. Our Sauiour himself foretelling, *that he being exalted (to wit vpon the Crosse) would draw al vnto himself*. And S. Paul teaching that *Christ spread his handes writing, that was against vs, vpon the Crosse*.
