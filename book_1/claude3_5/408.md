CHAP. XXXII.

*The children of Ruben and Gad, demanding to haue inheritance on that side Iordan, where they yet are, 7. Moyses iustly rebuketh them: 16. yet vpon condition that they wil march first ouer Iordan, and remaine the first in battel, til the land be subdued to the children of Israel, 28. he granteth to them, and the halfe tribe of Manasses, that which they request.*

AND the children of Ruben and Gad had much cattel, and they had in beastes an infinite substance. And when they had seene Iazer and Galaad fitte countries for to feede cattel, † they came to Moyses and Eleazar the priest, <sup>2</sup> and the princes of the multitude, and said: † Ataroth, and <sup>3</sup> Dibon, and Iazer, and Nemra, Hesebon, and Eleale, and Sabam, and Nebo, and Beon, † the land, which our Lord <sup>4</sup> smote in the sight of the children of Israel, is of a verie plentiful soile for the feeding of beastes: and we thy seruantes haue very much cattel: † and we pray thee if we haue <sup>5</sup> found grace before thee, that thou geue vs thy seruantes the same in possession, and make vs not passe ouer Iordan † To <sup>6</sup> whom Moyses answered: Why shal your brethren goe to fight, and wil you sitte here? † Why subuert you the mindes <sup>7</sup> of the children of Israel, that they may not be bold to passe into the place, which our Lord wil geue them? † Did not <sup>8</sup> your fathers so, when I sent from Cadesbarne to view the Land? † And when they were come as farre as the Valley of <sup>9</sup> cluster, hauing viewed al the countrie, they subuerted the hart of the children of Israel, that they should not enter the coastes,

[^1]: A right figure of those that would possesse heauen without labour or danger: and therefore shall not passe ouer Iordan into the land of promise.
