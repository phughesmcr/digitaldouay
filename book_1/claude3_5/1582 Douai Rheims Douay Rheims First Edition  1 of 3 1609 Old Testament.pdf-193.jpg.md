cometh worse and worse, desperate and obdurate, at last the father or master leaveth: I have made thee thus bad as thou art I by sparing thee and suffering thee to have thine owne pleasure, have nourished thy perversenes, and carelesnes: yet he saith not this, as though by his wil and intention, but by his goodnes and gentlenes the man became so wicked. It may here be demanded againe; why did not our Lord so mercifully punish Pharao, as wholly to reclaime him, for it seemeth that had benne greatest mercie? and God dealeth in this sorte, why doth he not with al, that al might be saved? First it is most justly and rightly ascribed to their iniquitie, which deserve to be indurate: againe why this sinner is reclaimed, and not an other of the same il deserts, is to be referred to Gods inscrutable iudgements, which are often secrete, never unjust. Let it therfore suffice piously and humbly to beleve, that as Moyses <sup>15</sup>testifieth, *God is faithful and without iniquitie, just and right*: and as the royal Prophet did professe, *Thou art God that wilt not iniquitie*. and as the Apostle teacheth, *there is no iniquitie with God*. By al which and some more to the same effect (which we omit for brevitie) S. Augustine concludeth againe, that properly Pharao hardened his owne hart, God only by bestowing benefites upon him, which he abused, and not plaguing him so much, as he deserved, but letting him live, and reigne, and persecute the Church for the time, until he and al his armie were in the middest of the sea. Whither (as the same learned Father noteth (ser. 89.) their owne desperate boldnes drew them, vaine furie through their owne madnes provoked them to goe so farre, where God not working, but only ceasing to continue his miracle, the waters returning to their owne nature, and meeting together inuolued and drowned them al.

Other like expositions the same learned father hath in other places. As, q. 18. *super Exodum*, he teacheth that Pharao being already so wicked through his owne fault, other things were done to him and his people, which partly were for correction of others, and might have bene to his, but he abusing al, became worse & worse, by Gods suffering and dispensation, *not only for his iust*, *but evidently iust punishment*. Li. 5. cont. Iulian. c. 3. touching the ground of temptation he allegeth these wordes saying: *There are in a maner al his owne concupiscense, abstracted and allured*: but touching one kind of Gods punishing some, that are more obstinate sinners, he allegeth the saying of the Apostle: *God hath delivered them into passions of ignominie, and into a reprobate sense, to do those things that are not convenient*, for God delivereth them (saith he) *connivently*: that the same sinners are made both punishments of sinnes past, and are deserts of punishments to come. Yet he maketh not the willes evil, but useth the evil as he wil, who can not wil anie thing unjustly. Againe, q. 24. It appeareth (saith he) that the cause of induration of Pharaoes hart, were not only the very patience of God, by which he spared him: Gods patience according to the mens hartes is profitable to some to repentance, to some unprofitable to resist God, & persist in evil: yet not of it selfe unprofitable, but through the evil hart.

Briefly, q. 18. *super Exodum* he saith, that is, I have bene patient with him and his servants. *Epist. 105. God doth not indurate by imputing malice, but by not imparting mercie* (or grace) *Li. de predest. & Grat. c. 4. God is sayed to indurate him, whom he wil not mollifie*. So also to repel him, whom he wil not cal. And c. 6. what is that to say: *I wil indurate his hart*, but I wil not mollifie it? *Isay. 64. It ought to have availed Pharao to salvation, that Gods patience deferring his just and deserved punishment, multiplied upon him frequent stripes of miracles, or mi-
