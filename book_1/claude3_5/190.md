turned into a dragon, thou shalt take in thy hand. <sup>16</sup>And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrewes sent me to thee, saying: Dismisse my people to sacrifice vnto me in the desert: and vntil this present thou wouldest not heare. <sup>17</sup>This therfore saith our Lord: In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold I wil strike with the rodde, that is in my hand, the water of the riuer, and it shal be turned into bloud. <sup>18</sup>The fishes also, that are in the riuer, shal dye, and the waters shal putrifie, and the Ægyptians shal be afflicted drinking the water of the riuer. <sup>19</sup>Our Lord also said to Moyses: Say vnto Aaron, Take thy rodde, and stretch forth thy hand vpon the waters of Ægypt, and vpon their floudes, and riuers and pooles, and al the lakes of waters, that they may be turned into bloud: and be there bloud in al the Land of Ægypt, as wel in the vessels of wood as of stone. <sup>20</sup>And Moyses and Aaron did as our Lord had commanded: and lifting vp the rodde he stroke the water of the riuer before Pharao and his seruantes: which was turned into bloud. <sup>21</sup>And the fishes, that were in the riuer, died: and the riuer putrifed, and the Ægyptians could not drincke the water of the riuer, and there was bloud in the whole Land of Ægypt. <sup>22</sup>And the enchanters of the Ægyptians with their enchantments did in like maner: and Pharaoes hart was indurate, neither did he heare them, as our Lord had commaunded. <sup>23</sup>And he turned away him selfe, and went into his house, neither did he yet set his hart to it this time also. <sup>24</sup>And al the Ægyptians digged round about the riuer for water to drinke: for they could not drinke of the water of the riuer. <sup>25</sup>And seuen dayes were fully ended, after that our Lord stroke the riuer.

<aside>The name of God attributed to men.</aside>

<aside>Iudges called goddes.</aside>

<aside>Moyses the God of Pharao.</aside>

[^1]: *The God of Pharao.*] The name of God, which essentially is proper only to the three Diuine Persons of the B. Trinitie, and incommunicable to anie creature (Sap. 14.) is neuertheles by similitude attributed in holie Scripture to other persons. As (Exod. 22. v. 8.) Iudges, or princes, are called goddes, for the eminent authoritie and powre which they haue from God. So Moyses was constituted the Iudge and God of Pharao, not only to punish him, for his obstinacie, and finally to compel him to dismisse the Israelites out of Ægypt, but also to terrifie him so in the meane time, that he being otherwise a mightie King, and extremly and often afflicted by Moyses, yet durst neuer lay violent handes vpon him, lest himselfe, and al his nation should presently haue bene destroyed.
