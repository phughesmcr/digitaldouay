is the hand of the Lord vnable? Now presently thou shalt
see whether my word shal be accomplished in deede. <sup>24</sup>Moyses therfore came, and told the people the wordes of our
Lord, assembling seuentie men of the ancientes of Israel,
whom he caused to stand about the tabernacle. <sup>25</sup>And our
Lord descended in a cloude, and spake to him, taking away
of the spirit that was in Moyses, and geuing to the seuentie
men. And when the spirit had rested on them, they prophe-
cied, neither ceased they any more. <sup>26</sup>And there had remai-
ned in the campe two men, of the which one was called
Eldad, and the other Medad, vpon whom the spirit rested.
:: for they also had bene enrolled, and were not gone forth to
<sup>27</sup>the tabernacle. And when they prophecied in the campe,
there ran a boy, and told Moyses, saying: Eldad and Medad
<sup>28</sup>do prophecie in the campe. Forthwith Iosue the sonne of
Nun, the minister of Moyses, and chosen of manie, said: My
<sup>29</sup>Lord Moyses forbid them. But he said: why hast thou
emulation for me? O that al the people might prophecie, and
<sup>30</sup>that our Lord would geue them his spirit? And Moyses re-
<sup>31</sup>turned, and the ancientes of Israel into the campe. And a
winde coming forth from our Lord, taking quailes ouer the
sea brought them, and let them fal into the campe the space
of one daies iourney, on euerie side of the campe round a-
bout, and they did flie in the ayre two cubites high ouer the
<sup>32</sup>earth. The people therfore rising vp al that day, and the
night, and the next day, gathered together a multitude of
quailes, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them
<sup>33</sup>round about the campe. As yet the flesh was in their teeth,
neither had that kind of meate failed: and behold the furie of
our Lord being prouoked against the people, stroke them
<sup>34</sup>with an exceeding great plague. And that place was called,
::The Sepulchres of concupiscence: for there they buried the
people that had lusted. And departing from the Sepulchres of
concupiscence, they came vnto Haseroth, and taried there.
