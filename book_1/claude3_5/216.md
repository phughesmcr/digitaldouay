THE CONTINVANCE OF THE CHVRCH
AND RELIGION IN THE THIRD AGE,
from Abrahams going forth of Chaldea,
to the passing of Israel out of Ã†gypt.
The space of 430. yeares.

<aside>The same Church & Religion in this age as in the former.</aside>

ONE and the same Church and Religion begunne in the first age of the world, and continued in the second, became more and more copious in the third. For in this age not only the same principal and particular points of faith, were beleued and professed, but also the number of professors encreased and partly by separation of place and abode, and specially by diuersitie of maners, outward rites, and conuersation were more distinct from infidels then before: as we shal now shew by the sacred historie of that time. Which beginneth with Abrahams going forth of his countrey of Chaldea, about 2024. yeares from the beginning of the World, in the 75. yeare of his age.

<aside>Beleefe in one God.</aside>

From which time forward God often appeared to him, and after him to Isaac and Iacob, in the title of EL SADDAI, that is, God Almightie: Creator of al things, Lord, God, most high, Possessor of heauen and earth (Gen. 14.) To Moyses more familiarly (Exod. 3.) in his most proper name, HE WHICH IS. In the name of foure letters, which the Iewes count ineffable. And in diuers other names, al shewing One, Eternal, Omnipotent, infinite Maiestie, of whom al other things depend, and haue their being, himselfe independent of any other thing.

<aside>Three diuine Persons.</aside>

This one diuine nature, and indiuisible substance is (aboue al reach of reason) three in Persons: represented to Abraham (Gen. 18) by three Angels, in forme of men, whom, by special instinct of God, he adored as one: and first spake vnto them as to one: Lord if I haue found grace in thy sight, goe not past thy seruant; and by and by as to manie: Wash yee your feete. In like maner Moyses sometimes speaketh plurally as of manie; There appeared to him three men, they saied: Where is Sara? sometimes singularly; He said: I wil come. So Lot (Gen. 19.) spake to two Angels representing the Sonne of God, and the Holie Ghost, one God with the Father, first as to manie, I beseech you my Lordes, turne into the house of your seruant; after as to one: I besech thee my Lord, because thy seruant hath found grace before thee. Who likewise answered as one only: I haue heard thy prayer. Againe Moyses sheweth distinction of Persons in God, saying (v. 24.) Our Lord rained from our Lord. Iob also (who liued in this age) and his frendes professed and serued the same one God, auouching him to be the onlie God and Lord, that geueth and taketh away (Chap. 1. 2.) He the maker and peculiar Keeper of men. He that taketh away sinne, and iniquitie (c. 7.) He that doth great things, incomprehensible, and meruelous,
