of his hunting, saying: Arise my father, and eate of thy
sonnes hunting: that thy soule may blesse me. <sup>32</sup>And Isaac
said to him: Why! who arth thou? who answered: I am
thy first begotten sonne Esau. <sup>33</sup>Isaac was amazed and astonished exceedingly: and marueling more then a man can
beleue, said: Who is he then that euen now brought me
venison that he had taken, and I did eate of al thinges before
thou camest? and I haue blessed him, and he shal be bles-
sed. <sup>34</sup>Esau hauing heard his fathers wordes, roared out with
a great crye: and being dismaied, said: Blesse me also, my father. <sup>35</sup>Who said: Thy brother came deceitfully and tooke
thy blessing. <sup>36</sup>But he said again: Rightly is his name called
Iacob: for he hath supplanted me loe the second time: my
first-birth-right he tooke before, and now the second time
he hath stollen my blessing. And againe to his father he said:
Hast thou not reserued me also a blessing? <sup>37</sup>Isaac answered:
I haue appointed him thy Lord, and al his brethren I haue
made subiect to his seruice: with corne and wine I haue established him, and for thee, my sonne, what shal I doe more
after this? <sup>38</sup>To whom Esau said: Hast thou one only blessing, father? I beseech thee blesse me also. And when he wept
that he howled againe, <sup>39</sup>Isaac being moued, said to him:
In the fat of the earth, and in the deaw of heauen from
aboue <sup>40</sup>shal thy blessing be. Thou shalt liue by the sworde,
and shalt serue thy brother: and the time shal come, when
thou shalt shake of, and loose his yoake from thy necke.
<sup>41</sup>Esau therefore alwaies hated Iacob for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him: and he said in his hart: The
daies wil come of the mourning of my father, and I wil kil
Iacob my brother. <sup>42</sup>These things were told to Rebecca:
who sending, & calling Iacob her sonne, said to him: Behold
Esau thy brother threatneth to kil thee. <sup>43</sup>Now therefore,
my sonne, heare my voice, and get thee vp and flye to Laban
my brother into Haran: <sup>44</sup>and thou shalt dwel with him a
few daies, til the furie of thy brother be aswaged, <sup>45</sup>and
his indignation cease, and he forget those things, which thou
hast done to him: afterward I wil send, and bring thee from
thence hither. Why shal I be depriued of both sonnes in one
day? <sup>46</sup>And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am wearie of my life
for the daughters of Heth: if Iacob take a wife of the stocke
of this land, I list not liue.
