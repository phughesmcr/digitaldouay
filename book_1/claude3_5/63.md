# Genesis

<aside>The common opinion of 72. tongues is not cleere in Scripture.</aside>

31\. The Nations] How manie Nations and tongues were in the world immediately after the towre of Babylon, is more commonly supposed, then cleerly shewed by old or late writers. Only it semeth certaine and euident, that there were iust as manie tongues as Nations. But to finde precisely (as the common opinion holdeth) 72, is hard. For in this chapter (where they would counte this number) are not mentioned so manie. Neuertheles if we adde certaine that begane distinct Nations afterwards, til Iacob with his children went into Aegypt (in whom only the Hebrew Nation and Tongue continued to Christes time, the number wil come right. Of Iapheth were borne 7. sonnes chiefe of Nations. Againe of Gomer (besides his supposed successor, who can not be counted beginner of an other distinct nation) came 2. other heades. Likewise of Iauan (besides his first sonne) rose 3. more nations. Of Cham by his first sonne Chus were 6. nephewes princes of nations. Againe of Regina (besides his successor) came one more. And Nemrod besides his kingdom of Babylon, raysed vp other 6. By his second sonne Mesraim came 8. nations, Chams third sonne Phut made only one nation. And Chanaan his sonnes made 11. more. Of Sem (last mentioned for better connecting the maine Historie, and succession of the Church) came the chiefe and principal Nation the Hebrewes, descending from him by Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, and so directly to Iacob. Of Sem also were borne 4. other sonnes beginners of nations. Againe of Aram (besides his first sonne) were 3 fathers of nations. Likewise of Heber (besides the Hebrewes descending by Phaleg) were borne to his other sonne Iectan 13. heades of nations. These are al that are named in this place: to wit, of Iapheth, 12. of Cham 33. and of Sem 21. which make in al 66. whereunto if we adioyne Nachor (Abrahams brother) Moab, and Ammon (Lots sonnes) also Ismael (Abrahams eldest sonne) and his issue by Cetura, and finally Esau (Iacobs brother) who made 6. more distinct nations, the whole number is 72. This probable collection, with the rest, we submit to better iudgement.

<aside>Yet this number of nations and tongues may be probably gathered in this and other places of Genesis.</aside>

## Chap. XI.

<aside>The fourth part of this booke. Of the diuision of tongues and nations.</aside>

God hindereth the vaine purpose of building a high towre, 7. by confounding mens tongues. 9. Wherof it is called Babel. 10. The genealogie of Sem to Abram.

1\. <sup>And</sup> the earth was of one tongue, and of one speach.

2\. <sup>And</sup> when they remoued from the east, they found a plaine in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.

3\. <sup>And</sup> ech one said to his neighbour: Come, let vs make bricke, and bake them with fire. And they had bricke in steed of stones, and bitume in steed of morter:

4\. <sup>and</sup> they said: Come, let vs make vs a citie and a towre, the toppe wherof may reach to heauen: and let vs renowne our name before we be dispersed into al landes.

5\. <sup>And</sup> our Lord descended to see the citie and the towre, which the children of Adam builded,

6\. <sup>and</sup> he said: Behold, it is one people, and one tongue is to al: and
