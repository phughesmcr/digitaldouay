ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XL.

*8. Doth not interpretation belong to God?* Dreames do come of divers causes. Some of natural complexion, or disposition, whereby Philosophers or Phisitions may probably iudge of the state of mans bodie. Some are rather effects of things past, then signes of anie thing to come. Of which sorte S. Gregorie (li. 8. Moral in cap 7. Iob) iudgeth Nabuchodonosors to be. Some are suggested by euil spirites, either to flatter worldlings with great pretenses, or to terrifie weake mindes with dangers and afflictions, or to vexe and trouble those in sleepe, whom they can not easely moue waking, as S. Gregorie discourseth (li. 8. Moral in cap 7. Iob.) Some dreames are of God, as in Iacob, Ioseph, these Eunuches, Pharao, Nabuchodonosor, and others both good and euil men. But to discerne and assuredly to iudge of some dreames, whether they be from God, by holie Angels, or illusions of euil spirites; is a special gift of God, as also the interpretation therof belongeth to God, as Ioseph here telleth. Whosoeuer therfore wil be secure must relie either vpon expresse Scripture, or iudgement of the Church, as in ominous speeches was noted before (chap. 24.) Otherwise the general rule is, not to observe dreames. Deut. 18.

CHAP. XLI.

*Pharaos dreames of fat & leane kine, also of ful and thinne eares of corne, 8. no other being able to interprete, 9. Ioseph is remembred. 25. Who interpreting the same, 38. is made ruler ouer al Ã†gypt. 50. marieth, and hath two sonnes, Manasses and Ephraim.*

<aside>Pharao his dreames, and his Eunuches were propheticall. Par-by, them God foreshewed things to come.</aside>

AFTER[^1] two yeares Pharao saw a dreame. He thought <sup>1</sup>he stood vpon a riuer, <sup>2</sup>out of the which came vp seuen kine, faire and fat exceedingly: and they fed in marish places. <sup>3</sup>Other seuen also came vp out of the riuer, foule and leane: and they fed on the very banke of the riuer, in greene places: <sup>4</sup>and they deuoured them, that had the maruelous beautie and good state of bodies. Pharao awoke, <sup>5</sup>and slept againe, and saw an other dreame:
