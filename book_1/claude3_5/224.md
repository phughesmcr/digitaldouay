of false goddes, avouching that there is no other, but the celestical God, maker
of the whole world. In which sincere profession how he alwayes persevered
is often testified, and needles here to be repeted. Also Sem, Sale, and Heber
his proper ancesters (the ninth, seuenth, and sixth in right line before him)
were al holie men, and liued al Abrahams time, much of Isaachs, and part
of Iacobs dayes. Likewise Melchisedech King and Priest (a distinct person, of
an other lineage, as we suppose, from Sem) liued in the beginning of this age.
At which being renowned men had great treines, or rather countries, which
with them serued the only true God. Wherof we haue example, in that
Abraham (being but a stranger in Chanaan) vpon a suddaine exploite,
<sup>Gen. 14.</sup>made readie of the seruants borne in his house, three
hundreth and eighteene: wel appointed, *men of armes, al of the same
religion*; for shortly after they were al circumcised (<sup>Gen. 17.</sup>) Yet was king
Melchisedech of more power and authoritie then he. And the other here men-
tioned, except his elder brother Nachor, and his nephew Lot, were his owne
direct progenitors, and by likelihood more potent. Againe from Abraham
the succession held on right to Aaron and Moyses, and the whole people
of Israel, which with them passed out of Ã†gypt through the redde sea.

But in the meane time, diuers also of Abrahams kindred and seede, brake
of from this communitie; and fel to idolatrie. For albeit Lot, his brothers sonne
perseuered in the true seruice of God, yet Lots sonnes, Moab and Ammon,
at least the Moabites and Ammonites, two nations that came of them
(<sup>Gen. 19.</sup>) were infidels and idolaters. Likewise though Nachor, and Bathuel
(Nachors sonne) continued henceforth in true faith and religion, yet Laban
(the same Bathuels sonne) had false goddes, which Rachel tooke away
(<sup>Gen 31.</sup>) But true religion being not wholly extinguished in these families,
both Isaachs wife Rebecca, and Iacobs wiues Lia and Rachel, with their hand-
maides Bala and Zelpha, either beleued rightly, or were more easily brought
to true beleefe, and seruice of God. Ismael Abrahams first sonne was in
his youth euel disposed (<sup>Gen. 21.</sup>) and for endeuoring to corrupt Isaac
(which S. Paul calleth persecution) was together with his mother Agar,
cast out of Abrahams house, yet prospered in the desert; had
twelue sonnes dukes, sometimes visited his father, and together with
Isaac buried him (<sup>Gen. 25.</sup>) And at the age of 137. yeares died and was
put to his people, that is, to others like himself good or euil. Abraham
also separated his other sonnes begotten of Cetura (<sup>v. 6.</sup>) from Isaac, to
whom only and not to any other, the promised land of Chanaan, and other
more special blessings pertained. Of these last sonnes came the people of Ma-
dianites, who kept some resemblance with the people of God in religion,
and therin prefigured heretikes, that descend from Catholique race, but falling
to schisme & heresie, doe not participate eternal inheritance, with the spiritual
