<sup>42</sup> I prosperously with you: Goe not vp, for our Lord is not with you: lest you fal before your enemies. <sup>43</sup> The Amalecite and the Chananeite are before you, by whose sword you shal fal, for that you would not consent to our Lord, neither wil our Lord be with you. <sup>44</sup> But they being blinded went vp to the toppe of the mountaine. But the arke of the testament of our Lord & Moyses departed not from the campe. <sup>45</sup> And the Amalecite came downe and the Cananeite, that dwelt in the mountaine: and striking and hewing them, pursued them as farre as Horma.

## CHAP. XV.

*Certaine precepts concerning Sacrifices, 17. and first fruites, are repeted, 22. also touching different punishment of sinne committed by ignorance and by set wilfullnes. 32. and accordingly one is stoned to death, for gathering stickes on the Sabbath day. 37. Al are commanded to carie a signe in their garments, therby to remember the commandements of God.*

<sup>1</sup> AND our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>2</sup> Speake to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shal be entred into the Land of your habitation, which I wil geue you, <sup>3</sup> and shal make oblation to the Lord for an holocaust, or victime, paying vowes, or voluntarily offering giftes, or in your solemnities burning a sweete sauour vnto the Lord, of oxen or of sheepe: <sup>4</sup> whosoeuer immolateth the victime, shal offer a sacrifice of flowre, the tenth part of an ephi tempered with oyle, which shal haue in measure the fourth part of an hin: <sup>5</sup> and wine of the same measure to powre the libamentes shal he geue for the holocaust or for the victime. For euerie lambe <sup>6</sup> and ramme there shal be a sacrifice of flowre of two tenthes, which shal be tempered with oile the third part of an hin: <sup>7</sup> and wine for the libamente, the third part of the same measure, shal he offer for a sweete sauour to the Lord. <sup>8</sup> But when thou makest an holocaust or hoste of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for pacifique victimes, <sup>9</sup> thou shalt geue for euerie oxe three tenthes of flowre tempered with oile, which shal haue halfe the measure of a hin: <sup>10</sup> and wine to powre libamentes of the same measure for an oblation of most sweete sauour to the Lord. <sup>11</sup> So shalt thou doe <sup>12</sup> for euerie oxe and ramme and lambe and buckegoate. <sup>13</sup> As wel they that are borne in the countrie as the strangers <sup>14</sup> after one rite shal offer sacrifices.
