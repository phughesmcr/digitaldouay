hundred fiftie sicles, of calamus in like maner two hundred
fiftie, <sup>24</sup> and of casia fiue hundred sicles after the weight of the
Sanctuarie, of oile of oliues the measure, hin: <sup>25</sup> and thou shalt
make the holie oile of vnction, an ointment compounded
by the art of an vnguentarie, <sup>26</sup> and therof thou shalt anoynt
the tabernacle of testimonie, and the arke of the testament,
<sup>27</sup> and the table with the vessel therof, the candlesticke, and
<sup>28</sup> the furniture therof, the Altars of incense, <sup>29</sup> and of holocaust,
and al the furniture that perteyneth to the seruice of
them. <sup>30</sup> And thou shalt sanctifie al, and they shal be most
Holie: he that shal touch them, shal be sanctified. <sup>31</sup> Thou
shalt anoynt Aaron and his sonnes, and shalt sanctifie them,
that they may doe the function of priesthood vnto me. <sup>32</sup> To
the children of Israel also thou shalt say: This oile of vnction
shal be holie vnto me through your generations. <sup>33</sup> The flesh
of man shal not be anoynted therewith, and you shal make
none other after the composition of it, because it is sanctified,
and shal be holie vnto you. <sup>34</sup> What man soeuer shal
compound such, and shal giue therof to a stranger, shal be
abandoned out of his people. <sup>35</sup> And our Lord said to Moyses:
Take vnto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, galbanum of
swete sauour, and the clearest frankincense, al shal be of
equal weight: <sup>36</sup> and thou shalt make incense compounded
by the worke of an vnguentarie, exactly tempered, and pure,
and most worthie of sanctification. <sup>37</sup> And when thou hast
beaten al into verie smal pouder, thou shalt set of it before
the tabernacle of testimonie, in the place where I wil appeare
to thee. Most Holie shal the incense be vnto you. <sup>38</sup> Such
confection you shal not make vnto your owne vses, because
it is holie to the Lord. <sup>39</sup> What man soeuer shal make the
like, to enioy the smel therof, shal perish out of his people.
