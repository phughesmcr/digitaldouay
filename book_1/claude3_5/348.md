CHAP. III.

<aside>This number exceedeth the other by 22305 that 300. Leuites are omitted in the general summe, otherwise the number of Israelites should exceede the first borne by 27. See the Annotation.</aside>

[^1] *Twentie two thousand.*] Immediatly before were numbred of Gersonites (v. 22.) 7500. of Caathites (v. 28.) 8600. and of Merarites (v. 34.) 6200. which make in al 22300. VVhy then are 300. left out of the summe: specially seing by and by (v. 43.) a smaler, and other odde numbers of 273. are expressed, and therupon inferred (v. 46.) that the first borne of the Israelites did so much exceede the Leuites. VVheras if the whole number of Leuites had bene also expressed in the general summe, as it is contained in the three particular summes, the Leuites should exceede the first borne of Israelites by the number of 27. For answere to this difficultie, some suppose that the first borne of the Leuites were iust 300. and therfore so manie supplying only their owne places, there remained iust twentie two thousand to supplie the places of the first borne of other Israelites, and so the Leuites were fewer then those for whom they were taken vnto Gods seruice, by the number of 273. But that the first borne of Leuites were neither more nor fewer then 300, is not euident by the text. Howsoeuer therfore this doubt be solued, sure it is, by S. Hieroms iudgement (*cited in the argument*) that these numbers are mystical. And the iust number of 22. thousand Leuites may signifie (*saith Origen, homil. 4. in Num.*) perfection, required in those that are designed to the particular seruice of God; as there be also iust 22. Hebrew letters, and 22. Patriarches from Adam to Iacob, from whom the Israelites descended.
