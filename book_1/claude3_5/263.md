Idolatrie committed.

14\. Wherewith God is pacified. 15. Yet Moyses coming from the Mount, and seing the calfe, and idolatrie, throweth downe the tables and breaketh them. 20. destroyeth the idol, 21. blameth Aaron, 27. causeth manie Idolaters to be slaine, 31. and againe prayeth for the people.

<sup>1</sup> And the people seeing that Moyses made tariance ere he came downe from the mount, being assembled against Aaron, they sayd: Arise, make vs goddes, that may goe before vs: for what hath chanced to this Moyses the man that brought vs out of the Land of Ægypt, we know not. <sup>2</sup> And Aaron sayd to them: Take the golden earlettes from the eares of your wiues, and sonnes and daughters, & bring them to me. <sup>3</sup> And the people did that he had commanded, bringing the earlettes to Aaron. <sup>4</sup> Which when he had receiued, he formed them by founders worke, and made of them a molten calfe. And they sayd: These are thy goddes Israel, that haue brought thee out of the land of Ægypt. <sup>5</sup> Which when Aaron had senne, he builded an altar before it, and by a cryers voice proclaimed saying: To morow is the solemnitie of the Lord. <sup>6</sup> And rysing in the morning, they offered holocaustes, and pacifique hostes, and the people sate downe to eate, and to drinke, and they rose vp to play. <sup>7</sup> And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: Goe, get thee downe: thy people, which thou hast brought out of the Land of Ægypt, hath sinned. <sup>8</sup> They haue quickly reuolted from the way, that thou didst shew them: and they haue made to them selues a molten calfe, and haue adored, and immolating hostes vnto it, haue sayd: These are thy goddes Israel, that haue brought thee out of the Land of Ægypt <sup>9</sup> And againe our Lord said to Moyses: I see that this people is stiffenecked: <sup>10</sup> suffer me, that my furie may be angrie against them, and that I may destroy them, and I wil make thee into a great nation. <sup>11</sup> But Moyses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why Lord, is thy furie angrie against thy people, whom thou hast brought forth of the Land of Ægypt, in great power, and in a strong hand? <sup>12</sup> Let not the Ægyptians say I beseech thee: He hath craftely brought them forth, that he might kil them in the mountaynes, and destroy them from the earth: let thyne anger cease, and be pacified vpon the wickednes of thy people. <sup>13</sup> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy seruantes,
