Abram.

[^2]

19\. *blessed him* ] Calvin (in cap.7.v.9. Heb.) Musculus (locis com. c. de Missa Papist.) and some other Protestants to avoid the connexion of Melchi-sedechs Priesthood and bringing forth of bread and wine, wil nedes have these wordes, *He was a Priest*, referred only to that which foloweth, *he blessed A-braham*. And some English translatters for this purpose have corrupted the text, by changing, *And* into *Therefore*, saying thus: *And he was a Priest of the most high God, therefore he blessed him*. which is also a false glosse. For Melchi-sedech did not blesse Abram because he was a Priest, for Abram was also a Priest, but because he was a greater Priest then Abram. which S. Paul vrgeth saying: *Without al contradiction that which is lesse, is blessed of the better*, concluding therupon that Melchisedech was greater then Abraham. As ane other Superiors that are not Priests may blesse their inferiors. As Iosue and Salomon blessed the people, and parents blesse their children.

20\. *Gave tithes* ] This is an other prerogative of Melchisedec, that Abram payd tithes to him, which S. Paul likewise explicateth (Heb.7.) and proveth therby that Christs Priesthood is greater then the Levitical. Moreover this paying of tithes by Abraham sheweth the antiquitie of this tradition, being practised in Abrahams time, that the spiritual Superiors receiued tithes of their inferiors.

CHAP. XV.

*Abram doubting and lamenting that he should have no childe, God promi-seth him much issue, 6. who beleeving is iustified, 9. offereth sacrifice pre-scribed by God, 13. and is forwarned that his seede shal be in strange land 400. yeares, 14. shal be delivered from servitude 18. and possesse Chanaan.*

<sup>1</sup> WHEN these things therfore were done, the word of our Lord was made to Abram by a vision saying: Feare not Abram, I am thy protector, & thy reward exceeding great. <sup>2</sup> And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou geue me? I shal goe without children: and the sonne of the stu-ard of my house is this Damascus Eliezer. <sup>3</sup> And Abram added: But to me thou hast not geuen seede: and loe my ser-uant borne in my house, shal be myn heire. <sup>4</sup> And immedi-atly the word of our Lord came to him saying: He shal not be thy heyre: but he that shal come out of thy wombe, him shalt thou haue thin heire. <sup>5</sup> And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Looke vp to heauen, and number the star-res, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shal thy seed be.
