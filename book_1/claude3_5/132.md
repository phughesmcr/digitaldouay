## Chapter XXXV

### Annotations

<aside>Cleansing from sinne is the first office of the servants of God.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> Cast away the strange goddes ] Iacob preparing to performe his vow of building a house (altar) to God, first extirpated Idolatrie from amongst his people; and then by Sacrifice appeased Gods wrath prouoked how soeuer and specially by Simeon and Leui killing the Sichemites. Duly considering that what people or person desireth Gods protection & blessings, must first be pure in Religion, and clensed from sinnes: *Qui te mala nocebit aduersitas, si nulla dominetur iniquitas*[^1] because no aduersitie shal hurt him, if no iniquitie haue dominion ouer him. *orat. ser. 6. post cineres.*

<aside>The name ISRAEL signifieth special prerogatiues in the Patriarch Iacob.</aside>

<sup>10</sup> *Called him Israel.* ] As the Patriarch now performeth his vow to God: so God fulfilleth his promise, geuing him a new name. For *Iacob supplanter*, signifying too smal force & praise for such a champion. God therfore honored him with the name of *Israel*. That is, *One that seeth and contemplateth God*, as most ancient writers expound it. *Allo of prince*, or *valiant with God*, as S. Hierom sheweth Tradit. Heb. For *Isar* in Hebrew signifieth *to dominate*, or *rule ouer*, and *El* signifieth God. And so this name geuen to him tellified that he, by Gods wil and grace, was valiant euen against an Angel representing God, much more against men, and other aduersaries. Others interprete it, *The right one of God*: as witnesseth the same S. Hierom both here, and in his commentaries in 44. Isaie. Al do importe a great excellencie in this Patriarch. And the successe of things confirmeth the same. Particularly in that not onlie some one of his sonnes (as in the issue of Abraham and Isaac, the rest being excluded) but his whole progenie of twelue sonnes, making twelue Tribes, were participanto of the peculiar blessings, in their ofspring possessing the promised land, and excedingly increasing became the most principal nation in the world, the selected people of God, called by the name and title of *the children of Israel*. Of whom not only Moyses, but al the old Testament most specially treateth, and of whom and in whom the promised Messias, the Redemer of mankind should be borne.
