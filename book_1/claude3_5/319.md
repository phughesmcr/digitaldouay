God would not haue made a contrarie general law, in anie case, for the whole nation of the Iewes, his people; and that vnder penaltie to be obserued, which is contrarie to the qualitie of indulgence or dispensation, and no such necessitie, as in the beginning of the world. Wherfore al protestants that say, the whole law written by Moyses concerning degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie, is the law of nature, and so pertaineth to Christians, must necessarily say also, that if now a maried man die without issue, his brother must marie his wife. Which specially they denie. It is also proued that this and some other degrees expressed in this place, were not against the law of nature (which is common to al nations, commonly or easely knowne to al men by discourse of reason) because no common wealth among the Gentiles did punish, nor modest men forbeare, or reprehend such mariages: as appeareth by Laban, who after he had deceiued Iacob by geuing him one sister for an other, offered him also the former promised, whom without difficultie of conscience he accepted (Gen. 29.) neither did that holie Patriarch thinke it vnlawful to keepe them both. And when Iudas matched his second sonne, and promised the third to the wife of his first sonne, he did it according to the custome of that place & time. Gen. 38. And Noemi spoke according to the same custome. Ruth. 1. v. 11. Againe where this law forbiddeth a man to marie, or companie with his wiues sister, it addeth, *whiles she is liuing*, not prohibiting mariage, when his first wife is dead. Yet his wiues sister is as neere in affinitie, as his brothers wife. Likewise the diuersitie of punishments (*chap. 20.*) for transgression of this law, either in the right line, or in the first collateral degree of consanguinitie, who were punished by death; and for transgressing in the first collateral degree of affinitie, or in the second either of consanguinitie or affinitie, who had lesse punishments, sheweth that the former degrees are prohibited by the law of nature, and not the other: for then the violation should be like sinne, and punished alike. Finally it is euident, that certaine of these degrees are not against the law of nature, by the example of holie Abraham, who in, and according to the law of nature, maried his brothers daughter called Sarai, otherwise Iescha, *Gen. 11.* which mariage God approued by manie blessings. Also Iacob maried two sisters together. Two sonnes of Iudas maried the same woman successiuely. And Amram [Moyses father] maried his aunt, his fathers sister. *Exod. 6. v. 20. Num. 26. v 59.* Wherfore seing neither the first collateral degree in affinitie, nor the second collateral in consanguinitie or affinitie, is forbid by the law of nature but by positiue only, and that both ceremonial and iudicial lawes of the old Testament ceased in the New, and are abrogated by Christ, it resteth proued that the same bind not Christians, but as they are renewed and established by the Church, or Christian commonwelthes. And as this is done in temporal causes by temporal States, partly by renewing and establishing the same, which was in the law of Moyses, as by punishing wilful murder by death; *Exod. 21. v. 12.* partly with alteration, as by punishing theift in some countries with death, but not adultery, which were contrarie in the old Testament, *Gen. 38. v. 24. 44. 17. Exod. 22. v. 1. Leuit. 20. v. 10:* in like sorte the Church of Christ ordaineth lawes, altereth, & vpon iust occasions dispenseth, in al degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie, not forbid by the law of nature
