[^1]: Martyr (in explic. 33. quaest. q. 14.)

[^2]: S. Augustine after a large discourse of this matter, in his second, third, and fourth bookes de Trinitate, hath these wordes: (li. 4. c. vlt.) If it be demanded of me, how either the voices, or sensible formes, and these were made before the incarnation of the word of God, which prefigured the same, I answer that God wrought them by Angels, who also (suppose I haue sufficiently shewed by testimonies of holie Scriptures. Likewise S. Gregorie (Prefat. in Iob. c. 2.) saith plainly, that an Angel appeared to Moyses in the fire bush, yet is called God, because he was the Legate of God, and therefore spoke, as if God himselfe had spoke in diuine Person, explicating the same by two examples, Dauid said: My people attend my law, yet neither the people, nor law was Dauids, but Gods. And the reader sayth amidst the people proclaming: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Neither doth he truly say, that he is God, nor by that he sayeth, doth he goe from the rule of truth. He also confirmeth the same doctrine, li. 28. Moral. ca. 1. And further teacheth that Angels protect men, and prouinces, and execute Gods wil in this inferior world. And so do the other Doctors of the Church S. Gregorie Nazianz. orat. ad 150. Episcop. Kenat. 3. de Theologia, in fine vtriusque. S. Basil. li. 3. cont. Eunom. S. Athanasius. ser. 4. cont. Arian, longius a princ. & Epist. de sinodo. Dionys. Areop. in fine. S. Ambrose, ser. 1. in psal. 118. S. Chrisost. ho. 6. ad pop. and S. Hierom. li. 3. comment. in Mat. 18. c. 14.

[^3]: I am which am.

[^4]: Qui est, he which is, is most proper name of God, not determining anie maner, but indeterminadly signifying al maner of being, for so it importeth the very infinite immensitie of Gods substance. S. Damascen. li. 1. c. 12. Orthodoxae fidei. S. Tho. p. 1. q. 13. a. 11.

CHAP. IIII.

*Moyses receiuing power to worke miracles in confirmation of his mission, 14. and his brother Aaron being designed to assist him, 20. goeth with wife and children towards Ã†gypt, 25. is in danger to be slaine for not sooner circumcising his sonne. 27. Aaron meeteth him, 29. so they goe together, and declare to the people, that God wil deliuer them.*

MOYSES answering said: " They wil not beleue me, <sup>1</sup>
nor heare my voice, but they wil say: Our Lord hath
not appeared to thee. <sup>2</sup> Therefore he sayd to him: What is
that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rodde.
<sup>3</sup> And our Lord sayd: Cast it vpon the ground. He did cast it,
and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moyses fled. <sup>4</sup> And
