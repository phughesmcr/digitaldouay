Moyses.

EXODVS.

our Lord sayd: Stretch thy hand, and catch the tayle therof.
He stretched it forth, & tooke hold of it, and it was turned
into a rodde. <sup>5</sup>That they may beleue, quoth he, that the
Lord God of their fathers hath appeared to thee, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, & the God of Iacob. <sup>6</sup>And
our Lord sayd agayne: Put thy hand into thy bosome.
Which when he had put into his bosome, he brought it forth
ful of leprosie like snow. <sup>7</sup>Draw backe, quoth he, thy hand
into thy bosome. He drew it backe, and brought it forth
agayne, & it was like the other flesh. <sup>8</sup>If they wil not beleue thee, quoth he, nor heare the word of the former signe,
they wil beleue the word of the signe folowing. <sup>9</sup>And if so
be they wil beleue neither of these two signes, nor heare thy
voice: take water of the riuer, & powre it out vpon the
drie land, and whatsoeuer thou drawest of the riuer, shal be
turned into bloud. <sup>10</sup>Moyses sayd: I beseech thee, Lord, I
am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and
since thou hast spoken to thy seruant, I haue more impediment & slownes of tongue. <sup>11</sup>Our Lord sayd to him:
Who made the mouth of man? or who framed the dumme
and deafe, the seeing and the blinde: did not I? <sup>12</sup>Goe on
therefore, and I wil be in thy mouth: & wil teach thee what
thou shalt speake. <sup>13</sup>But he sayd: I beseech thee, Lord, send
whom thou wilt send. <sup>14</sup>Our Lord being angrie at Moyses,
sayd: Aaron thy brother the Leuite, I know that he is eloquent:
behold he cometh forth to meete thee, & seeing thee shal
be glad at the hart. <sup>15</sup>Speake to him, and put my wordes in
his mouth: & I wil be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and
wil shew you what yee must doe. <sup>16</sup>He shal speake in thy
steed to the people, and shal be thy mouth: but thou shalt
be to him in those thinges that perteine to God. <sup>17</sup>This
rodde also take in thy hand, wherwith thou shalt doe the
signes. <sup>18</sup>Moyses went his way, & returned to Iethro his
father in law, and sayd to him: I wil goe and returne to my
brethren into Ægypt, that I may see if they be yet aliue. To
whom Iethro sayd: Goe in peace: <sup>19</sup>Therfore our Lord sayd
to Moyses in Madian: Goe, and returne into Ægypt: for
they are al dead that sought thy life. <sup>20</sup>Moyses therfore
tooke his wife, & his children, and set them vpon an asse:
and returned into Ægypt, carying the rodde of God in his
hand. <sup>21</sup>And our Lord said to him returning into Ægypt:

<aside>:: God designed a rodde for an instrument to worke miracles.</aside>

[^1]: This rodde also take in thy hand, wherwith thou shalt doe the signes.
