Genesis

<sup>24</sup> Luther's argument answered. and corruption of flesh, was then very general, great, of long continuance, & obstinate, yet was it not so universal, but that God himself excepted Noe, saying to him *I have found thee just in my sight in this generation*; whereby it is clere that these general termes, *al cogitation and al flesh*, have exceptions. As likewise other as general propositions in this same chapter, concerning the punishment threatened, comprehend not absolutely al, and everie one, but almost al, very few excepted. *I wil cleane take away*, or destroy *man whom I have created, from the face of the earth. The end of al flesh is come before me*. againe, *that I may destroy al flesh wherein is breath of life under heaven*. These are very general speaches, that al should be destroyed, and yet eight persons of mankind, that had the same natural flesh, and amongst other living creatures, that had breath, divers payres were saved alive. So that this place (not anie other in holie Scripture) wil not prove that Protestants paradox, that al mens actions are mortal sinnes, or that no man in this life is or can be iust; but manie scriptures tel vs plainly that some men were iust, as Noe, Iob, Daniel, Zacharias, Elisabeth, Simeon and others. Of Noe see more in the next annotation.

[^1] *Noe was a iust and perfect man*. Here Noe is not onlie called iust, but also perfect. The hebrew word *tamim* of the verbe *tamam* (which signifieth to finish or accomplish) sheweth that Noe was a perfect or complete man doing al that he was commanded, and performing the offices of al vertues that pertained to him; and that not in a vulgar and meane sorte, but in a high degree, & heroical maner, as sundrie ancient Fathers have gathered vpon this place. We shal cite some few of their sayings for example. S. Hierom (Tradit. Hebrai. in Gen.) distinguishing betwen consummate iustice (of the next life) & iustice of this generation (or transitorie life) saith: *Noe therfore was perfect in his generation: Noe did walke with God: that is, he did folow his steppes*. S. Augustin (li. 15. ciuit. c. 26.) saith the like, that *Noe was called iust in his generation, to wit, not as the citizens of Gods citie are to be perfected in that immortalitie, in which they shal be equal to Angels, but as they may be perfect in this pilgrimage*. And in his booke de perfectione contra Caelestium, he describeth him to be *a perfect man, that ran without blame towards perfection, voide of damnable sinnes, and not negligent to cleanse venial sinnes, by almes, prayers*, and other good workes. S. Ambrose also testifieth, (li. de Noe & arca c. 4.) that albeit the world was verie wicked, yet some were iust, saying: *By the grace (or favour) which Noe found, is declared that other mens offences doth not obscure the iust man, when he is praised, not by the nobilitie of his birth, but by the merit of his iustice and perfection*. S. Chrisost. most largely (ho. 23. in Gen.) setteth forth the iustice and perfection of Noe. Where after he hath shewed that Noe deserved in deede the name of a man, because he by flying vices, and folowing vertues conserued the image of man, when others like beastes were ledde away and ruled by their wicked lustes, proceedeth thus in his commendation: *Behold (saith he) an other kind of praise: Noe is called, iust, which denomination comprehendeth al vertue. For this name iust we vse to pronounce of them, that exercise al maner of vertue. And that you may learne, how he arised to the very toppe which was then also required of our nature, the Scripture saith, he was iust, being perfect in his generation*. He perfor-med what thinges soever it behoueth one to doe that embraceth vertue; for such a one is perfect, he intermitted nothing, he halted in nothing, he did not wel in this thing, and sinned in that thing, but was perfect in everie ver-tue, which was requisite for him to have. Moreover to make also this iust man more conspicuous to vs in regard of the time, and by comparing him with o-thers, the Scripture saith, *he was perfect in his generation*: in that time, in that
