Exodvs. 201

to al aegis, being readie to kil, and sacrifice his owne most dearly beloued
sonne Isaac. For which God sware by himself, *that he would manie
waies blesse him*, because (saith God) thou hast obeyed my voice
(Gen. 22.) <sup>17</sup>He prayed for Sodom, and had preuailed, if tenne iust persons
had benne found in that citie (Gen. 18.) <sup>18</sup>And Lot was deliuered from
thence for Abrahams sake (Gen. 19.) Isaac was also of most sincere mind,
deuout to God, exercised himself in meditation or mental prayer (Gen. 24.)
obtained by prayer his desire of issue. (Gen. 25.) Likewise Iacob is described
in the holie text a plaine (or sincere and innocent) man. (Gen. 25. v. 27.)
patient and constant in tribulations. (Gen. 29. 31. 32. 35.) He lawfully
purchased Esaus consent of the firstbirthright. (Gen 25. v. 31.) He neither
lied, nor otherwise sinned, when he answered his father that he was Esau
his first-begotten sonne (Gen. 27.) but spake truth in mystical sense,
agreable to Gods wil and ordinance, who so transferred Isaacs blessing from
Esau to Iacob. Which Isaac at length vnderstanding, confirmed him self
therto, and confirmed the same (v. 33. & ch. 28.) giuing Esau such con-
tentment as he could of temporal blessings. Ioseph is renowned for al vertues,
euen from his youth to his death (Gen 37. 39. 50.) Iob was simple and
right, fearing God and departing from euil, a iust and innocent
man, both before and in his tribulations, not sinning with his lippes:
neither spake he anie foolish thing against God (ch. 1.) yea more
afflicted retained innocencie (ch. 2.) and finally God receiued his prayer
for others, and restored al his losses duble. (ch. 42.) Moyses a most special
selected Prophet, the meekest man on the earth, of singular zeale seuerely
punished sinne, but withal most charitably prayed God to forgiue the people
and conserue his Church.

God of his mere mercie electeth al those, whom he wil iustifie and saue,
offering al sufficient grace, iustly leaueth some obstinate sinners in state of
damnation, (Gen. 25. Exo. 7.) His predestination, foreknowledge and
promise, do not exclude but include the meanes, whereby his wil is done in the
iust (Gen. 25. 37. 45 50.) Neither is Gods reprobation the cause of anie
mans damnation, but mans owne sinne the proper cause, both of reprobation
& damnation. For example, Pharao & his people enuying, vainly fearing
and for their religion hating, and persecuting the children of Israel, by
oppressing them with vnsupportable labours, by commanding secretly to kil
their infants, and that not succeeding, by a new decree to drowne them
(Exo. 1.) were mercifully after long conniuence, admonished by Gods legates
in his name quietly to permit his people to serue him; but they wilfully
contemned this gentle admonition, Pharao proudly and insolently answering:
Who is the Lord, that I should heare his voice, and dismisse Israel?
I know not the Lord, and Israel I wil not dismisse. (Exo. 5.) So
