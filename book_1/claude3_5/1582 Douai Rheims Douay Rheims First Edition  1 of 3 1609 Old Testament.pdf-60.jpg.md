GENESIS.

it was decreed that al should kepe it. And so peace was made. Neuerthelesse it was abolished when the cause ceased. As S. Augustin declareth against Faustus the Manichee. Such is the authoritie of the Church to decree, and againe to disanul an obseruation of a thing of it selfe indifferent.

[^1] Noe sinned not in drunkennes: because he knew not the force therof, hauing drunck only water al his life before. But this external rebuke, and worldlie disgrace happened to Noe, in figure of Christ naked on the Crosse. As S. Cyprian (Epist. 63. ad Cecilium) S. Augustin (li. 16. de ciuit. c. 2. & li. 12. contra Faustum Manicheum. c. 23. & 24.) Eucherius, Rupertus and others (vpon this place) do teach. And likewise that Sem and Iapheth were a figure of the Church consisting of Iewes and Gentiles, and Cham of Heretikes, and other Infidels, that deride the infirmities, which our Sauiour susteined. Goe to now (saye Manichees, saith S. Augustine) obiect calumnies to the ancient holie Scriptures, doe so, yee children of Cham, to whom naked flesh seemeth vile; by which your wickednes were begotten. For neither could yee anie meanes haue benne called Christians, except Christ as he was foretold by the Prophetes, had come into the world, had drunke that cuppe of his vinyard, which could not passe from him, had slept in his passion, as in drunkennes of folie (which is wisdome men) and so the infirmitie of mortal flesh (which is stronger than men) had become naked, by the secret counsel of God, which infirmitie yours, the word God had taken vpon him, the very name Christian, wherof yee also glorie, had not benne at al in the earth.

[^2] Why Chanaan the sonne is cursed, and not his father Cham, diuers yeld diuers reasons. S. Theodoretus reporteth out of the Hebrew Doctors, that Chanaan a boy first saw his grandfather nakednes, and told the same to his father, and so they both derided that they should haue couered, Cham other sonnes not offending; and therfore not his whole progenie but only Chanaan & his posteritie were here cursed by Noe. S. Chrisostome supposeth that for so much as God had blessed Noe & his three sonnes coming forth of the Arke, he could not presume to curse anie of those, whom God had blessed, therfore cursed Chanaan as like to his father. S. Gregorie bringeth this, for example of wicked men, escaping punishment in this life, and are punished in the next. And in their posteritie, folowing their vices. *If that meaneth* (saith he) *that Cham sinning, Chanaan his sonne had sentence of seruage, but that the sinnes of the parents are punished here in their children. And clere it is that Chanaans most wicked posteritie were subdued in the end, and most of them destroyed by the children of Israel (who were of Sem) vnder the conduct of Iosue, according to Noes prophetical blessing of Sem, and cursing of Chanaan.

[^3] This blessing of Iapheth was literaly fulfilled, when (according to his name, which signifieth latitude or enlargement) his posteritie possessed most ample countries, both in the Continent, and Ilandes. But mystically it had effect (As S. Hierom. S. Augustin. Rupertus and others expound it) when the Apostles, being Iewes of the race of Sem, first builded the Christian Church, wherin the most part of that nation refused to dwel, conteyning Christs Gospel & grace, and the fulnes of Gentiles entred in, and were made inheriters. Finally Chanaan is seruant to both Sem and Iapheth, in that Heretikes being vnder the Iurisdiction of the Church, geathered of Iewes and Gentiles, serue to further Catholiques diligence to more exact knowledge of truth, and their patience to more merite and glorie.
