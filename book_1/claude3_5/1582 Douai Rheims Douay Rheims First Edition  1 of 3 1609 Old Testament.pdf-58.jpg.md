# GENESIS

## CHAP. IX.

*God reneweth the blessing of multiplication,3 alloweth the eating of flesh, but not of bloud. 8. promiseth neuer againe to destroy the world by water 22. Cham saw, and reported his fathers nakednes, which Sem and Iapheth couered. 24. For which he his cursed, and they are blessed.*

[^1]: Of this commandment, or rather blessing see the Annotations. chap. 1. v. 28.

<sup>1</sup>And God blessed Noe and his sonnes. And he said to them: Increase, & multiplie, and replenish the earth. <sup>2</sup>And your terror and dread be it vpon al the beasts of the earth, and vpon al the foules of the ayre, with al that moue vpon the earth: al the fishes of the sea are deliuered to your hand. <sup>3</sup>And al that moueth, and liueth shal be yours for meat: euen as the grene herbes haue I deliuered al to you. <sup>4</sup>Sauing that flesh with bloud you shal not eate. <sup>5</sup>For I wil require the bloud of your soules at the hands of al beasts: and at the hand of man, at the hand of ech man, and of his brother, wil I require the soule of man. <sup>6</sup>Who soeuer shal sheed mans bloud, his bloud shal be shed: for to the image of God man was made. <sup>7</sup>But increase you and multiplie, and goe vpon the earth, and fil it.

<sup>8</sup>Thus also said God to Noe, and to his sonnes with him: <sup>9</sup>Behold I wil establish my couenant with you, and with your seede after you: <sup>10</sup>and with euerie liuing soule, that is with you, as wel in al foules as in catle & beasts of the earth that are come forth out of the arke, and in al beasts of the earth. <sup>11</sup>I wil establish my couenant with you, and al flesh shal be no more destroyed with the waters of a floud, neither shal there be from henceforth a floud to wast the earth. <sup>12</sup>And God said: This is the signe of the couenant which I geue betwen me and you, and to euerie liuing soule, that is with you, for perpetual generations: <sup>13</sup>my bowe wil I set in the cloudes, and it shal be the signe of a couenant betwen me and betwen the earth. <sup>14</sup>And when I shal couer the element with cloudes, my bowe shal appeare in the cloudes: <sup>15</sup>and I shal remember my couenant with you, and with euerie liuing soule that beareth flesh: and there shal no more be waters of a floud, to distroy al flesh. <sup>16</sup>And my bowe shal be in the cloudes, and I shal see it, and I shal remember the euerlasting couenant, that was made betwen God,

[^2]: The rainbow was before, but was not a signe, as now God saith henceforth it should be, for men to remember his promise. Seuerianus in Gen. S. Tho. Quodlib. 3. a. 30.
