29 yeares. <sup>29</sup>And when he saw that the day of his death approached, he called his sonne Ioseph, and said to him: If I haue found grace in thy sight, put thy hand vnder my thigh: and thou shalt doe me this mercie and truth, not to bury me 30 in Ægypt: <sup>30</sup>but "I wil sleepe with my fathers, and take me away out of this land, and burie me in the sepulchre of my ancesters.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XLV

[^1] Sauing the land of the Priests.] Let them heare which now liue (saith S. Chrysostom) what great care men had in times past of the priests of idols: The immunities and let them learne at least to yeeld like honour to true priests, to whom the vse and care of ministerie of diuine offices is committed. For if the Ægyptians, in their errors, had so great care of Idols, thinking them to be more honored, if their ministers were respected, how much condemnation doe they not deserue, that yea amongst vs now diminish that, which pertaineth to the prouision of priests? Doe yee not know that the honour pertaineth to God himself? Regard not therefore him to whom the honour is exhibited. For it is not for his cause to whom thou doest it, but for his sake whose priest he is, that of him thou maiest abundantly receiue rewards. Wherefore he saith: *He that receiueth a prophet in the name of a prophet, shal receiue the reward of a prophet.* Wil our Lord reward thee according to the worthines or meannes of his ministers? According to thine owne affection, he either crowneth or condemneth. &c. I say not this for the priests sakes, but for yours, desiring to gaine you in al things. For in lieu of that litle you geue, you shal receiue immense rewards, and vnpeakeable good. Let vs consider these things, and haste to serue them, not looking vpon the cost, but vpon the gaine, and increase that riseth therof. &c. For whatsoeuer you bestow vpon Gods priests, he accounteth it as bestowed on himself. And he that so bestoweth, shal not only receiue like retribution, but manifold greater: our merciful God, alwayes of the abundance of his mercie, exceeding the things which are done by vs. Let vs not therefore be worse then infidels, who for the error of Idols geue so much to their seruants; for how much error and truth do differ, so much difference is there, betwen theirs and Gods Priests. Thus much and something more writeth S. Chrisostom vpon this place.

[^2] Priests] The Hebrew word Cohanim is here vniuersally translated Priests, in al languages and Editions: which (chap. 40. v. 45.) some translate eth Princes, but Princes and more probably (2. Reg. 8. v. 18.) where Dauids sonnes are called Cohanim: which were in deede Princes, and not properly Priests. But in this present place it signifieth those, to whom Pharao alowed particular prouision in al the time of dearth, which al vnderstand of Priests, and not of Princes.
