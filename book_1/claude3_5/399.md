# Daughters may inherite.

## CHAP. XXVII.

Salphaads daughters succede to their fathers inheritance. 8. And the law is established that for lack of sonnes daughters shal inherite, and for lack also of daughters the next of kinne. 12. God commandeth Moyses to ascend into Mount Abarim, and thence view the promised Land, but fortelleth him that he shal die, and not goe into it. 15. He then prayeth God to prouide an other to lead the people, 18. and Iosue is designed in presence of Eleazar and the people.

<sup>1</sup> AND there came the daughters of Salphad, the sonne of Hepher, the sonne of Galaad, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasses, who was the sonne of Ioseph: whose names are, Malaa, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa. <sup>2</sup> And they stood before Moyses and Eleazar the priest, and al the princes of the people at the doore of the tabernacle of couenant, and said: <sup>3</sup> Our father died in the desert, neither was he in the sedition, that was raised against our Lord vnder Core, but he died in his owne sinne: he had no men children. Why is his name taken away out of his familie, because he hath not a sonne? Geue vs possession among the kinne of our father. <sup>4</sup> And Moyses referred their cause to the iudgement of our Lord. <sup>5</sup> Who said to him: <sup>6</sup> The Daughters of Salphad require a iust thing: geue them possession among their fathers kinne, and let them succede him in the inheritance. <sup>7</sup> And to the children of Israel thou shalt speake these thinges: <sup>8</sup> When a man dieth without a sonne, his inheritance shal passe to his daughter. <sup>9</sup> If he haue no daughter, he shal haue his brethren his successours. <sup>10</sup> And if he haue no brethren neither, you shal geue the inheritance to his fathers brethren. <sup>11</sup> but if he haue no such vncles by the father neither, the inheritance shal be geuen to them that are the next of kinne. and this shal be to the children of Israel a holie ordinance by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded Moyses. <sup>12</sup> Our Lord also said to Moyses: Goe vp into this mountaine Abarim, and view from thence the Land which I wil geue to the children of Israel. <sup>13</sup> and when thou shalt haue seene it, thou also shalt goe to thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone: <sup>14</sup> because you did offend me in the desert Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctifie me before them vpon the waters, these are the waters of contradiction in Cades
