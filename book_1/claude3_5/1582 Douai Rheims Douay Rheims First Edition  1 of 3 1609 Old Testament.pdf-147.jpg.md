name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue "the Saviour of the world. And he gave him to wife Aseneth the daughter of Putiphar[^1] priest of Heliopolis. Ioseph therfore went forth <sup>46</sup> to the land of Egypt (and he was thirtie yeares old when he stood in the sight of king Pharao) and did circuite al <sup>47</sup> the countries of Egypt. And the fertilitie of the seuen yeares came: and the corne being bound vp into sheaues <sup>48</sup> was gathered together into the barnes of Egypt. Al the abundance also of graine was laid vp in euerie citie. <sup>49</sup> And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it became equal to the sand of the sea, and the plentie exceeded <sup>50</sup> measure. And there were borne vnto Ioseph two sonnes before the famine came: whom Aseneth the daughter of <sup>51</sup> Putiphar priest of Heliopolis bare him. And he called the name of the first begotten *Manasses, saing: God made me <sup>52</sup> to forget al my labours, & my fathers house. The name also of the second he called *Ephraim, saing: God hath made <sup>53</sup> me to encrease in the land of my pouertie. Therfore when the seuen yeares of the plentufulnes, that had bene in Egypt <sup>54</sup> were passed: the seuen yeares of scarsitie beganne to come, which Ioseph foretold: and in the whole world the famine preuailed, but in al the land of Egypt there was <sup>55</sup> bread. The which being in hunger, the people cried to Pharao, desiring foode. To whom he answered: Goe ye to Ioseph: and whatsoeuer he shal say to you, that doe ye. <sup>56</sup> And the famine dayly encreased in al the land: and Ioseph opened al the barnes, and sold to the Egyptians: for them <sup>57</sup> also the famine had oppressed. And al prouinces came into Egypt, to buy victuals, and to moderate the miserie of the scarsitie.

[^1]: Cohen signifieth priest; as not only the Latin, but also the 70. & Philo here translate though sometimes it signifieth prince. as the Chaldey paraphrast interpreteth, whereby it is probable that this Putiphar was both a priest, and a prince.

41. *Made gouernour*] It is easie in the eyes of God, suddenly to enrich the Holie Ioseph poore. For who would haue thought (saith Philo) that in one day a bondman suddenly should be made a lord, a poore prisoner the chiefe of the nobilitie, an vnder vanced, gaolor the viceroy, or kings deputie, for a common prison to haue a kinglie court of his owne, from extreme ignominie, to ascend into so hiegh a roome of dignitie?
