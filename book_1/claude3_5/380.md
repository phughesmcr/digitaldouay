### CHAP. XVII.

<aside>Example of one miracle proueth the possibilitie of an other.</aside>

1. *Aarons rodde*] This rodde without roote, neither it self planted, nor anie liue branch ingraffed therin, al drie without iuyce or moisture, bringing forth buddes, flowers, and fruite, was a figure that our B. Ladie should beare a sonne, and remaine a Virgin. And this example euidently demonstrateth that the same could so do, it being no more contrarie to nature, that a virgin should conceiue, and beare a child without losse of virginitie, then that the drie rodde should bud and beare fruite, without ordinarie concourse of nature. *S. Aug. ser. 3. de temp. S. Greg. Nissem. de natiuit. Dom. S. Bernard, ho. 2. in Euang. Missus est.*

### CHAP. XVIII.

*The charge and burden of Priestes within the tabernacle, and of Leuites about the same. 8. First fruites, and oblations are due to the Priestes; 21. the tithes to the Leuites; 26. who of the same pay tithes to the Priestes.*

AND our Lord said to Aaron: Thou, and thy sonnes, and the house of thy father with thee shal beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuarie: both thou & thy sonnes together shal beare the sinnes of your priesthood. <sup>2</sup> but thy brethren also of the tribe of Leui, and the scepter of thy father take with thee, and let them be readie at hand, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sonnes shal minister in the tabernacle of testimonie. <sup>3</sup> And the Leuites shal watch vpon thy pre­ceptes, and vpon al the workes of the tabernacle: so not withstanding, that they approch not to the vessel of the Sanctuarie and to the altar, lest both they die, and you perish withal. <sup>4</sup> but let them be with thee, and watch in the cu­stodies of the tabernacle, and in al the ceremonies therof. A stranger shal not ioyne with you. <sup>5</sup> Watch in the custodie of the Sanctuarie, and in the ministerie of the altar: lest indignation rise vpon the children of Israel. <sup>6</sup> I haue geuen you your brethren the Leuites out of the middes of the chil­dren of Israel, and haue deliuered them a gifte to the Lord, to serue in the ministeries of his tabernacle. <sup>7</sup> And thou and thy sonnes looke to your priesthood: and al thinges that per­teyne to the seruice of the altar, and that are within the vele, shal be executed by the priestes. if anie stranger approach, he shal be slaine. <sup>8</sup> And our Lord spake to Aaron, behold I haue geuen thee the custodie of my first fruites. Al thinges that are sanctified of the children of Israel, haue I deliuered to thee and to thy sonnes for the priestlie office, as euerlasting ordinances.
