ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. X.

[^1]: Nemrod.] To this Nemrod the sonne of Chus, first builder and king of Babylon, Iosephus, S. Epiphanius, S. Hierom, S. Augustin, and generally al ancient writers ascribe the first tyrannie, and first erecting vp of an earthlie citie opposite to the Citie of God after the floud. He was a *valiant*, or rather a *violent hunter* (a giant hunter (saith S. Augustin, according to the seuentie Interpreters) who by falshhood and force brought men vnder his dominion. For he stirred vp pride (saith Iosephus) and contempt of God in men, auoching that they were not beholding to God for present felicitie, but to their owne vertue; and so supposing men would stil from God to him, if he offered him selfe a leader, and helper against a new floud, by little and litle drew al to tyrannie. He was otherwise called Saturnus, and was at length amongst others accounted a god. After him his sonne Belus Iupiter (as most authors affirme) raigned 65. yeares. And then succeded Ninus the first king of the Assirians.

[^2]: *Assur builded Niniue*] Here is great difficultie, and much dispute amongst writers, who this Assur is. Briefly, we may either say with Iosephus and S. Augustin, that Assur the sonne of Sem built a citie, which afterwards Ninus of Chams race enlarged, enriched, and changing the name called it Ninum: or els that this word *Assur* here signifieth (as. 4. Reg. 15. Psal. 81. Isaie 10. & 31.) the king of Assirians, to wit Ninus the sonne of Belus, who was historied prince and barbarous tyrant (saith S. Hierom) was the first that raigned ouer al Asia, & among the Assirians built Ninum a citie of his owne name, which the Hebrewes cal Niniue. He set vp the Monarchie of the Assirians, called the golden kingdom, which stood 1240. yeares. And made his father Belus to be honored for a god. To whom the Babilonians, as Plinie testifieth, first erected statues, altares, & temples. Of this Belus or Bel of Babylon were also deriued other false goddes, as Belial the god of Libertines, or without yoke, Beelphegor god of the Moabites, Beelzebub of the Accaronites, Baalin Samaria, Baalim amongst the Philistims: and the like in other nations.
