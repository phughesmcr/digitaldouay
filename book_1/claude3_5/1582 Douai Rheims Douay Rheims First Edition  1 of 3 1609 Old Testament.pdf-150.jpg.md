<sup>29</sup> And they came to Iacob their father into the land of Chanaan, and they told him al thinges that had chanced vnto them, saying: <sup>30</sup> The lord of the land spake to vs roughly, and thought vs to be spies of the prouince, <sup>31</sup> to whom we answered: We are men of peace, neither do we attempt any treachery. <sup>32</sup> We are twelue brethren borne of one father: one is not liuing, the youngest is with our father in the Land of Chanaan. <sup>33</sup> Who said to vs: Thus shal I trie that you be men of peace: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take ye prouision necessarie for your houses, and goe your wayes, <sup>34</sup> and bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receiue this felowe againe, that is kept in prison: and afterwardes may haue licence to bye what thinges you wil. <sup>35</sup> This being said, when they powred out their corne, euerie man found his money tied in the mouth of the sackes: and al being astonyed together, <sup>36</sup> their father Iacob said: You haue made me to be without children, Ioseph is not liuing, Simeon is kept in bondes, and Beniamin you wil take away: al these euils are fallen vpon me. <sup>37</sup> To whom Ruben answered: Kil my two sonnes, if I bring him not againe to thee: deliuer him into my hand, and I wil restore him vnto thee. <sup>38</sup> But he said: My sonne shal not go downe with you: his brother is dead, and he alone is remayning: if any aduersitie shal chance to him in the land to the which you goe, you shal bring downe my hoare heares with sorowe vnto hel.
