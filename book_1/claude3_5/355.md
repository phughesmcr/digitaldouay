offering withal the baskette of azymes, and the libamentes
<sup>18</sup> that by custome are dew. Then shal the Nazareite be sha-
uen before the dore of the tabernacle of couenant, from the
bush of the haire of his consecration: and he shal take his
haires, and lay them vpon the fire, that is put vnder the sacri-
<sup>19</sup> fice of pacifiques: And a shoulder of the ramme boyled,
and one cake without leuen out of the baskette, and one
wafer vnleuened, and he shal deliuer them into the handes
<sup>20</sup> of the Nazareite, after that his head be shauen. And recei-
uing them againe from him, he shal eleuate them in the sight
of the Lord: and being sanctified they shal be the priestes, as
the breast, which was commanded to be separated, and the
shoulder. after these thinges the Nazareite may drinke wine.
<sup>21</sup> This is the law of the Nazareite, when he shal vow his ob-
lation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides
those thinges which his hand shal find, according to that
which he had vowed in his minde, so shal he do to the fulfil-
<sup>22</sup> ling of his sanctification. And our Lord spake to Moyses,
<sup>23</sup> saying: Speake to Aaron and his sonnes: Thus shal you
<sup>24</sup> blesse the children of Israel, and you shal say to them: Our
<sup>25</sup> Lord blesse thee, and keepe thee. Our Lord shew his face
<sup>26</sup> to thee, and haue mercie vpon thee. Our Lord turne his
<sup>27</sup> countenance vnto thee, and geue thee peace. And they
shal inuocate my name vpon the children of Israel, and I wil
blesse them.

CHAP. VI.

<aside>God prescri-
bed the rule of
Nazareites, &
the rites of
their consecra
tion.</aside>

*First consecrate themselues*] To such as of their owne accord, would bind
them selues by vow to certaine thinges not comanded, God prescribeth a Rule
containing three special obseruations; not to drinke wine, or anie thing that
may make drunke; not to cut their haires; and not to touch a dead corps. He
appointeth likewise rites in making this profession, and calleth the professed
*Nazarites*, that is, *segregated* or *separated* from the ordinarie state of people:
though it was, for most part, but for a time, to be limited by the parties them
selues, and in some perpetual, as in Samson. *Iudic. 13. Now what do Nazarites*
*signifie* (saith S. Gregorie (*li. 1. c. 23. Moral.*) *but those that abstaine, and separate*
*voluntarily from thinges otherwise lawful? As from eating flesh, either at certaine*
*daies and times, or altogether; from Mariage; from proprietie in worldlie*
*goodes; and the like.*

[^1]: The same was
a figure of
vowes both
temporal and
perpetual.
