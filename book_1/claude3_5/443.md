<sup>31</sup> beside the valle that reacheth and entreth farre. For you
shal passe ouer Iordan, to possesse the Land, which the Lord
your God wil geue you, that you may haue and possesse it.
<sup>32</sup> See therfore that you fulfil the ceremonies and iudge-
mentes, which I shal sette this day in your sight.

CHAP. XII.

*Al idolatrie, and whatsoeuer apperteineth therto must be destroyed. 5. Sacri-
fices, tithes, and donaries must be offered in the special place, 15. Eating
flesh they must not eate the bloud. 29. In no case to imitate the idolatrie
of gentiles.*

<sup>1</sup> THESE are the preceptes and iudgementes, that you
must do in the Land, which the Lord God of thy fathers
wil geue thee, to possesse it al the daies, that thou shalt goe
vpon the earth. <sup>2</sup> Subuert al places, wherein the nations,
which you shal possesse, worshipped their goddes vpon the
high mountaines, and hilles, and vnder euerie tree ful of
leaues. <sup>3</sup> Ouerthrow their altares, and breake their statues,
their groues burne with fire, and their Idols hewe al to
peeces: destroy their names out of those places. <sup>4</sup> You shal
<sup>5</sup> not doe so to the Lord your God: but to the place, which
the Lord your God hath chosen of al your tribes, to put his
<sup>6</sup> name there and to dwel in it, shal you come: and shal offer
in that place your holocaustes and victimes, the tithes and
first fruites of your handes, and your vowes and donaries,
<sup>7</sup> the first borne of your oxen and sheepe. And you shal eate
there in the sight of the Lord your God: and you shal reioyce
in al thinges, whereunto you shal put your hand, you and
your house, wherein the Lord your God hath blessed you.
<sup>8</sup> You shal not doe there the thinges, that we doe here this
<sup>9</sup> day euerie man that which seemeth good to him self. For
vntil this present time you are not come to rest, and to the
<sup>10</sup> possession, which the Lord your God wil geue you. You
shal passe ouer Iordan, and shal dwel in the Land, which the
Lord your God wil geue you, that you may haue rest from al
<sup>11</sup> enemies round about: and may dwel without al feare, in
the place, which the Lord your God shal choose, that his
name may be therin. Thither shal you bring al the thinges,
that I command you, holocaustes, and hostes, and tithes, and
the first fruites of your handes: and whatsoeuer is the prin-
cipal in the giftes, that you shal vowe to our Lord. There
