# Genesis

[^1] Resurrection, and Iudgement, where al things shal be exactly discussed and Iudged. And then wil folow Eternal life to the good: and Euerlasting paine to the damned.

Al these points of Religion (and others mentioned in the former age, and no doubt taught by Noe & his sonnes) shew clerly a Visible Church, consisting of good and bad. Noe preached the same before the floud; Sem and Iapheth are commended and blessed for wel doing; Cham blamed, & cursed in his posteritie: yet neither he nor anie of his sonnes or daughters fel into heresie, or other infidelitie, for anie thing that appeareth in Scripture, or other authentical testimonie. Heber also and his familie are particularly commended by Moses, as the right beleuers, and the spiritual children of Sem (who had innumerable other children) as those that were innocent touching the presumptuous building of others, who for the same fault lost their old tongue, which the familie of Heber kept. As S. Chrisostom and S. Augustin do proue. Againe, diuers of this familie faling afterward by little and little to other errors, the Familie of Thare, saith the same S. Augustin (li. 16. c. 12.) albeit not al, or not alwayes, yet euer as some of them, and Abraham continually, with Sem, Heber, Phaleg, & manie others, not mentioned by Moyses in his briefe description (as S. Gregorie doubteth not to suppose) were iust, and kept the true faith, and vndefiled Religion.

[^2] But Nemrod Chams nephew, and sonne of Chus: described for a valiant hunter, a violent giant, and tyrant, was an Archeretike, a deuiser and teacher of false doctrin, against God and true faith. By subteltie and tyrannie he induced manie of liking or feare to folow him, and so in schisme he maintained heresie. That men were not beholding to God, but to them selues, for temporal prosperitie.

Wherof begane a new & cruel confederacie, against the Citie of God, & the second great Sect of Infidels. For Barbarisme being the first, begun by Cain and ended by the floud: The second mother of al Sectes beginning after the floud (as S. Epiphanius writeth) was Scythisme: so called of the Scythians a most cruel people. Who according to Nemrods heresie (not thinking them selues beholding to God for temporal happines, but to their owne forces) tyrannized ouer the weaker, and manie wicked banning together extreamly persecuted the peaceable, specially the Church and true seruants of God. And this was an especial cause of building Babylon, besides their ambitious desire of perpetual fame, and their bearing the simple in hand of a defense against a new floud, to make it in dede, a strong hold for tyrants to offend others, and to defend themselues. Wherfore God (who before destroyed al infidels by the floud) confounded these builders by diuiding their tongues, and so forced them to breake, and part into manie countries.
