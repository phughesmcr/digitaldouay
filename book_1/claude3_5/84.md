and thy seede after thee: Al the malekind of you <sup>11</sup> shal be circumcised: and you shal circumcise the flesh of your prepuce, that it may be for a signe of the couenant betwen me and you. <sup>12</sup> An infant of eight daies shalbe circumcised among you, al malekind in your generations: asvel the homebred shal be circumcised, as the bought seruant of whosoever he is, not of your stocke: <sup>13</sup> and my couenant shal be in your flesh for a perpetual couenant. <sup>14</sup> The male, whose flesh of his prepuce shal not be circumcised, that soule shalbe destroied out of his people: because he hath broken my couenant. <sup>15</sup> God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not cal Sarai, but Sara. <sup>16</sup> And I wil blesse her, and of her I wil giue thee a sonne, whom I wil blesse, and he shalbe into nations, and kings of peoples shal spring of him. <sup>17</sup> Abraham fel vpon his face, & laughed, saying in his hart: Shal trowest thou to him that is an hundred yeare old a sonne be borne? and Sara that is nyntie yeares old shal she beare? <sup>18</sup> And he said to God: I would that Ismael may liue before thee. <sup>19</sup> And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shal beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt cal his name Isaac, and I wil establish my couenant to him for a perpetual couenant, and to his seed after him. <sup>20</sup> Concerning Ismael also I haue heard thee. behold, I wil blesse him, and increase, and multiplie him exceedingly: twelue dukes shal he beget, and I wil make him into a great nation. <sup>21</sup> But my couenant I wil establish with Isaac, whom Sara shal bring forth to thee at this time an other yeare. <sup>22</sup> And when he had leaft of speaking with him, God ascended from Abraham. <sup>23</sup> And Abraham tooke Ismael his sonne, and al the homebred of his house: and al whom he had bought, al the males of al the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their prepuce forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him. <sup>24</sup> Abraham was nyntie and nyne yeares old, when he circumcised the flesh of his prepuce. <sup>25</sup> And Ismael his sonne was ful thirtene yeares old at the time of his circumcision. <sup>26</sup> The selfsame day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his sonne. <sup>27</sup> And al the men of his house, as wel the homebred, as the bought seruantes and strangers were circumcised together.
