# GENESIS.

## ANNOTATIONS.
### CHAP. XXXV.

<aside>Clensing from sinne is the first office of his people; and then by Sacrifice and specially by Simeon and Levi killing the Sichemites. Duly considering that what people so ever do offend God, are enemies to bleffings, must first be pure in Religion, and clensed from sinnes:</aside>

1. Cast away the strange goddes: ] Jacob preparing to performe his vow first extirpated al Idolatrie from amongst his people; and then by Sacrifice appeased Gods wrath provoked how soever and by whom soever. *Quia non habebit inimicos extrinsecos, si nulla ei dominentur iniquas:* because no adversitie shal hurt him, if no iniquitie haue dominion ouer him. *orat. fer. 6. post cineres.*

<aside>The name ISRAEL signifieth special prerogatiues in the Patriarch Jacob.</aside>

10. Called him Israel. ] As the Patriarch now performed his vow to God: so God fulfilleth his promise, giuing him a new name. For Israel signifieth, *seeing God*, or *a Prince with God*: signifying two final effects & praise for such a champion, God therfore honored him with the name of Israel. That is, *One that seeth and contempleteth God*, as most ancient writers expound it. Also, *a Prince with God*, as S. Hierom sheweth. Tradit. Heb. For שר in Hebrew signifieth *to dominier, or rule ouer*, and אל signifieth God. And to this name geuen to him restifieth that he, by Gods gift and grace, was valiant euen against an Angel representing God, much more against men, and other aduersaries. Others interprete it, *The right one of God*: as witnesseth the same S. Hierom both here, and in his commentaries in 44. Isaie. Al do importe a great excellencie in this Patriarch. And the successe of things confirmeth the same. Particularly in that not onlie (some few of his funnes (as in the issue of Abraham and Isaac, the rest being excluded) but his whole progenie of twelue sonnes, making twelue Tribes, were participant of the peculiar blessings, in their offspring possessing the promised land, and exceedingly increasing became the most principal nation in the world, the selected people of God, called by the name and title of *the children of Israel*. Of whom not only Moyses, but al the old Testament most specially treateth, and of whom and in whom the promised Messias, the Redemer of mankind should be borne.
