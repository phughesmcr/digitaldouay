Exodvs.

times conuersant with men, hated, persecuted, sold, betraied; who caried his owne crosse, was sacrificed, vanquished al his enimies, aduanced, and acknowledged the true Sauiour of the world, Redemer and deliuerer of mankind, from seruitude, slauerie, thraldome, and bondage of sinne, death, and the diuel.

<aside>Prophecie of Christ.</aside>

Againe Abraham prophecied that of his seede Christ our Sauiour should be borne, when he saied to his seruant (<sup>Gen. 24.</sup>) Put thy hand vnder my thigh, that I may adiure thee by our Lord God of heauen & earth, that is, by Christ, who should come of his loynes, srs. Hierom (Tradit Heb. in Gen. et explic. Psal. 44.) S. Ambrose (li. 1. c. 9. de Abraham) and S. Augustin (q. 62. in Gen. et li. 16. c. 33. ciuit.) expound it. More euidently Iacob (<sup>Gen. 49.</sup>) The scepter shal not be taken away from Iudas, and a duke of his thigh, til he do come that is to be sent, and the same shal be the expectation of the Gentiles. Iob as plainly : I know that my redemer liueth. Moyses foreknowing that Christ the true Redemer, and chiefe Lawgiuer should be sent, praied God to hasten his mission, saying: I beseech thee Lord, send whom thou wilt send. (<sup>Exod. 4.</sup>)

<aside>Sacrifice. Altares. Churches, dedicated.</aside>

External Sacrifice was frequent and solemne, as the soueraigne homage to God. And manie Altares erected by Abraham for that purpose (<sup>Gen. 12. 13. 15. 22.</sup>) Publique, in bread and wine by Melchisedech (<sup>Gen. 14.</sup>) other priuate sacrifices (<sup>Gen. 35. v. 14</sup>) offered by Iacob, with dedication of the place called Bethel : the house of God : which he also before hand promised by vow (<sup>Gen 28.</sup>) Diuers other sacrifices offered by Isaac, and Iacob (<sup>Gen 26. 31. 33. 36.</sup>) By Iob and his frends (<sup>Iob. 1. & 42.</sup>) by Moyses, Aaron, and other ancients of Israel. (<sup>Exod. 12.</sup>) Al which consequently show Priesthood, whose proper office it is to offer Sacrifice, though amongst al the aboue named, onlie Melchisedech was called a Priest. And among the gentiles we finde that Putiphar (<sup>Gen. 41.</sup>) and Iethro (<sup>Ex. 3.</sup>) whose daughters Ioseph and Moyses maried) were called Priests, or as the word Cohenin doth also signifie, Princes, for they were great and eminent men in their countries. At least those that by special priuilege were exempted from selling their landes to Pharao, and had notwithstanding prouision of maintenance in time of dearth (<sup>Gen. 47.</sup>) were properly called Priests, for such function as they had in seruing their idols. For where was true and right Sacrifice, there were also true Priests, and where Idolatrical sacrifice there were like Priests, and where no external sacrifice at al (as amongst Protestants) there are no Priests, but ministers only.

In this age also (long before Moyses) the Sacrament of Circumcision was giuen to Abraham, for distinction of Gods selected and peculiar people, and for remedy of original sinne, in the male sexe of Abrahams seede, and others of his communitie. In the other sexes, and other generations, former remedies of sacrifice, or other profession of faith were auailable. For other sinnes, not only
