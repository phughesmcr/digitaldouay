enting in they are destroyed: and that our Lord might accom-
plish his word, which by oath he promised to thy fathers
Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. <sup>6</sup>Know therfore that not for
thy iustices hath the Lord thy God geuen thee this excellent
land in possession, wheras thou art a verie stiffe necked
people. <sup>7</sup>Remember, and forget not how thou didst pro-
uoke the Lord thy God to wrath in the wildernesse. From
the same day, that thou camest out of Ægypt vnto this place,
thou hast alwayes contended against our Lord. <sup>8</sup>For in
Horeb also thou didst prouoke him, and being wrath he
would haue destroyed thee, <sup>9</sup>when I went vp into the
mounte, to receiue the tables of stone, of the couenant
which our Lord made with you: and I continewed in the
mounte fourtie daies and nightes, not eating bread, nor drink-
ing water. <sup>10</sup>And our Lord gaue me two tables of stone
written with the finger of God, and conteyning al the wordes
that he spake to you in the mounte from the middes of the
fyre, when the assemblie of the people was gathered. <sup>11</sup>And
when fourtie dayes were passed, and as manie nightes, our
Lord gaue me the two tables of stone, the tables of coue-
nant, <sup>12</sup>and he said to me, Arise, and goe downe from hence
quickly: for thy people, which thou didst bring out of Æ-
gypt, haue quickly forsaken the way, that thou hast shewed
them, and haue made them :: a molten idol. <sup>13</sup>And againe
our Lord said to me: I see that this people is stiffe necked:
<sup>14</sup>suffer me that I may destroy them, and abolish their name
from vnder heauen, and may set thee ouer a Nation, that is
greater and stronger then this. <sup>15</sup>And when I came downe
from the burning mounte, and held the two tables of coue-
nant with both handes, <sup>16</sup>and saw that you had sinned to
the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calfe, and
had quickly forsaken his way, which he had shewed you:
<sup>17</sup>I cast the tables out of my handes, and brake them in your
sight. <sup>18</sup>And I fel downe before our Lord as before, fourtie
dayes and nightes not eating bread, nor drinking water, for
al your sinnes, which you committed against our Lord, and
prouoked him to wrath: <sup>19</sup>for I feared his indignation and
anger, wherwith being moued agaynst you, he would haue
destroyed you. And our Lord heard me this time also.
<sup>20</sup>Against Aaron also being exceeding angrie, he would
haue destroyed him, and for him, in like maner did I
