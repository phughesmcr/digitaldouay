GENESIS. 101

Jacob. <sup>12</sup> Jacob? And I answered: Here I am. <sup>13</sup> Who said: Lyft vp thine eyes, and see al the males ascending vpon the females, them of diuers colours, the spotted and the speckled. For I haue seene al things that Laban hath done to thee. <sup>14</sup> I am the God of Bathel, where thou didest anoinnte the stone, and didest vowe the vowe vnto me. Now therfore arise, and goe out of this land, returning into the land of thy natiuitie. <sup>15</sup> And Rachel and Lia answered: Haue we any thing left in the goods, and heritage of our fathers house? <sup>16</sup> Hath he not reputed vs as strangers, and sould vs, and eaten our price? <sup>17</sup> But God hath taken our fathers riches, and deliuered them to vs, and to our children: wherefore do al things, that God hath commanded thee. <sup>18</sup> Iacob therefore rose vp, and setting his children, and wiues vpon camels, went his way. <sup>19</sup> And he tooke al his substance, and flockes, and whatsoeuer he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac his father into the land of Chanaan. <sup>20</sup> At that time Laban was gone to sheare his sheepe, and Rachel stole the "idols of her father. <sup>21</sup> And Iacob would not confesse to his father in law that he fled. <sup>22</sup> And when he was gone as wel him selfe as al things that were his right, and hauing passed the riuer was marching on to Mount Galaad, <sup>23</sup> it was told Laban the third day that Iacob fled. <sup>24</sup> Who, taking his brethren vnto him, pursued him seuen dayes: and he ouertooke him in the Mount Galaad. <sup>25</sup> And he saw in his sleepe God saying vnto him: Take heede thou speake not roughly anie thing against Iacob. <sup>26</sup> And Iacob had now pitched his tent in the mountaine: and when he with his brethren had ouertaken him, he pitched his tent in the same Mount Galaad. <sup>27</sup> And he said to Iacob: Why didest thou so, that vnwitting to me thou wouldest carie away my daughters as captiues with the sword? <sup>28</sup> Why wouldest thou flee without my knowledge, and not tel me, that I might haue brought thee on the way with ioy, and songes, and timbrels, and citharnes? <sup>29</sup> Thou hast not suffered me to kisse my sonnes and daughters: thou hast donne foolishly: now also in dede, my hand is able to requite thee euil: but the God of your father said vnto me yesterday: Take hede thou speake not any thing against Iacob roughly. <sup>30</sup> Suppose, thou didest desire to goe to thy freinds, and hadest a longing to thy fathers house: why didest thou steale my goddes?
