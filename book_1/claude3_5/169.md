the Almightie shal blesse thee with the blessings of heauen from aboue, with the blessings of the depth, that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the pappes and of the wombe. <sup>26</sup> The blessings of thy father were strengthned with the blessings of his fathers: vntil the desire of the eternal hilles came: be they vpon the head of Ioseph, & vpon the crowne of the Nazarite among his brethren.

<sup>27</sup> Beniamin a rauening woolfe, in the morning shal eate the pray, and in the euening shal diuide the spoile.

<sup>28</sup> Al these in the tribes of Israel twelue: these things spake their father to them, and he blessed euerie one, with their proper blessings. <sup>29</sup> And he commanded them, saying: I am gathered vnto my people: burie you me with my fathers in the duble caue, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite, <sup>30</sup> against Mambre in the Land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to burie in. <sup>31</sup> There they buried him, & Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried. <sup>32</sup> And when he had finished the precepts wherwith he instructed his sonnes, he plucked vp his feet vpon the bed, and died: & he was put vnto his people.

He was also depriued of his prerogatiue in Priesthood, which was afterward annexed to the Tribe of Leui, wherupon the Chaldee paraphrasis speaketh thus to Ruben: It belonged to thee to haue receaued three better lettes then thy brethren, Priesthood, Best portion, and the Kingdome: but because thou hast sinned, the duble portion is geuen to Ioseph, the Kingdome to Iudas, and Priesthood to Leui.

[^2] *Vessels of iniquitie.*] Albeit Simeon and Leui were moued with iust zeale to punish the foule crime committed by Sichem, against their sister and whole familie: yet in their maner of reuenging were manie sinnes worthely condemned by Iacob, both immediatly after the fact, and here at his death.
