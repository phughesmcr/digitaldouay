ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXII.

Iames teacheth) but by trial and experiment maketh men knowen to the world, as here Abrahams faith and singular obedience were manifested, when he doubted not to offer his only begotten in sacrifice, accounting that God is able to raise vp euen from the dead. Wherupon he receiued his sonne againe in parable, that is, in figure and mysterie of Christ dead and aliue againe. Isaac also in this action signified the diuinitie of Christ which suffered not; and the ramme among the briers figured his humanitie, that should be offered in Sacrifice to God.
