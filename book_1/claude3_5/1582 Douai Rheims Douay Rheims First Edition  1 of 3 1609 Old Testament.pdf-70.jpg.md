GENESIS.

houres, setteth forth their owne, & omitteth them only in place of goddes. Thus
saith S. Athanasius. Name we like countries, prouinces, cities, and townes
in these partes of Europe, where Luthers scholars haue set their seate,
consider the forme of Religion, and opinions which they hold, and we shal
see as vnorderlie beginninges, and as horrible dissentions in heresies (which
S. Hierom calleth the feates of the new Iehemans) as the ancient fathers haue
discried in Paganisme. For Lutherans or Protestants hauing no lawful gene-
ration, but proceeding of bastards race, vpstartes of vnknowne progenie, are
no lesse at discorder among them selues, only al agreing against Catholi-
ques, like syncretisantes against their comon enemies, or Herod, Pilate, &
the Iewes against Christ. And in England alone are diuers sectes without
possible meanes to agree in one. For albeit their ciuil state endeuoreth prudently
and seriously to bring al to vniformitie, at least in publique shew, yet they
are but like manie faces vnder one hood, eurie sorte keping their owne opini-
ons: yea almost euerie preacher and meane scholar (to say nothing of artificers
and common vnlearned) arrogating to be his owne iudge, contemneth to
stand to Luther or Caluin, to Geneua or Parliament, to Conuocation or Synod
of their owne, but to his owne only vnderstanding, and interpretation of
holie Scripture. Nor yet to that alwayes; for when he is pressed with that he
once said, he wil not stand to his owne word, if he haue not written it, or
that you haue not witnesses against him, so hard it is to make a deceiued Pro-
testant or Puritan confesse that he is conuinced, except by very pregnant mea-
nes you can first cast out of him, or bind fast the spirite of presumption, dissen-
tion and contention: wheras the simplest Catholique in the world hath the
selfe same faith in al pointes, with the learned Church, in which he remaineth;
and vpon whose iudgement he dependeth.

To returne therfore, from whence we are not vnnecessarily digressed, we
conclude with S. Augustin; When Moyses had shewed the beginning and
progresse of Nemrods earthlie citie, leauing it in Babylon, that is confu-
sion, as credible to professe it further, he returneth to declare the perpe-
succession of the Citie of God, the Church, as before the floud from Adam
to Noe, by the line of Seth, so after the floud from the same Noe, by the line
of Sem, Arphaxad, Sale, Heber, Phaleg, Reu, Sarug, Nachor,
Thare, to Abraham. The rest of Sems children, and al the progenies of
Iapheth and Cham, are not pertaining to this purpose, omitted, so connecting
those in order of generations, by whom the succession is directly brought to
Abraham, Prince of the elected people, a most special Patriarch, to whom new
and great promises are made of multiplication of his seede, and possession
of the land of Chanaan, but especially of Christ our Redemer, and the same
manie waies confirmed, as wil appeare in the next age.
