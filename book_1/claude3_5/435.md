<sup>12</sup> thee this day to doe them. If after thou hast heard these iudgementes, thou keepe and doe them, the Lord also thy God wil keepe the couenant vnto thee, and the mercie which he sware to thy fathers: <sup>13</sup> and he wil loue and multiplie thee, and wil blesse the fruite of thy wombe, and the fruite of thy land, thy corne, and vintage, oile, and heardes, the flockes of thy sheepe vpon the Land, for the which he sware to thy fathers that he would geue it thee. <sup>14</sup> Blessed shalt thou be among al peoples. There shal be none barren with thee of neither sexe, as wel in men as in thy flockes. <sup>15</sup> Our Lord wil take away from thee al disease: and the sore infirmities of Ægypt, which thou knowest, he wil not bring vpon thee, but vpon al thyne enemies. <sup>16</sup> Thou shalt deuoure al the peoples, which the Lord thy God wil geue thee. Thyn eye shal not spare them, neither shalt thou serue their goddes, lest they be the ruine of thee. <sup>17</sup> If thou say in thy hart: These nations are moe then I, how shal I be able to destroy them? <sup>18</sup> Feare not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to al the Ægyptians, <sup>19</sup> the exceding great plagues, which thyne eies saw, and the signes and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arme, that the Lord thy God might bring thee forth: so wil he doe to al peoples, whom thou fearest. <sup>20</sup> Moreouer hornettes also wil the Lord thy God send vpon them, vntil he destroy and consume al that escaped thee, and can hide them selues. <sup>21</sup> Thou shalt not feare them, because the Lord thy God is in the middes of thee, a mightie God and terrible: <sup>22</sup> he wil consume these nations in thy sight by litle and litle and by partes. Thou mayest not destroy them al together: lest perhappes the beastes of the earth multiplie against thee. <sup>23</sup> And the Lord thy God wil geue them in thy sight: and wil kil them vntil they be vtterly destroyed. <sup>24</sup> And he wil deliuer their kinges into thy handes, and thou shalt destroy their names vnder heauen: no man shal be able to resist thee, vntil thou destroy them. <sup>25</sup> Their sculptiles thou shalt burne with fyre: thou shalt not couet the siluer and gold, wherof they were made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing therof, lest thou offend, because it is the abomination of the Lord thy God. <sup>26</sup> Neither shalt thou bring in ought of the Idol into thy house, lest thou become anathema, as also that is. As filthines thou shalt detest it, and as vncleannes and filth thou shalt account it abominable, because it is anathema.
