GENESIS.

there is found bdelium, & the stone onyx: <sup>14</sup> And the name of the second riuer is Gehon: that is it which compasseth al the land of Ethiopia. <sup>15</sup> And the name of the third riuer is Tygris: that same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth riuer, the same is Euphrates.

<sup>15</sup> Our Lord God therefore tooke man, & put him in the Paradise of pleasure, to worke, & keepe it. <sup>16</sup> And he commanded him saying: Of euerie tree of Paradise eate thou: <sup>17</sup> But of the tree of knowledge of good & euil eate thou not. For in what day soeuer thou shalt eate of it, thou shalt dye the death. <sup>18</sup> Our Lord God also said: It is not good for man to be alone: let vs make him a helper like vnto him selfe. <sup>19</sup> Our Lord God therefore hauing formed of clay al beastes of the earth, and foules of the ayre, brought them to Adam that he might see what to cal them: for al that Adam called any liuing creature, the same is his name.

<sup>20</sup> And Adam called al beastes by their names, and al foules of the ayre, and al cattel of the fielde: but vnto Adam there was not found an helper like him selfe. <sup>21</sup> Our Lord God therefore cast a dead sleepe vpon Adam: and when he was fast a sleepe, he tooke one of his ribbes, & filled vp flesh for it. <sup>22</sup> And our Lord God :: built the ribbe which he tooke of Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.

<sup>23</sup> And Adam said: This now, is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shal be called woman, because she was taken out of man. <sup>24</sup> Wherfore man shal leaue his father & mother, & shal cleaue to his wife, & they shal be :: two in one flesh. <sup>25</sup> And they were both naked, to wit Adam & his wife: and were not ashamed.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. II.

1. *The seuenth day.*] Al creatures being made in their kindes in six dayes, complete and perfect, God not neding (as men often do in their workes) to perfect, poolish, or amend the same, *rested the seuenth day*: and therfore the natural perfection of Gods workes is attributed to the seuenth day, and the supernatural perfecting of men in eternal life, after the Resurrection, is attributed to the eight day, as S. Augustin and other fathers teach. And for this cause *God blessed and sanctified this seuenth day*, and after we haue in the Decalogue, or tenne commandments, that this day al should rest and abstaine from workes, yea and keepe it festiual, occupying them selues in spiritual exercises seruice and special worshipe of God, as the Iewes did euen til Christs, and his Apostles

[^1]: As we say bricke is made of earth, and a house is built of bricke: so Adam was made of earth and Eue built of a ribbe of Adam. And that of one ribbe, as if God should build a house of one bricke, or as in dede he feded. 5000. men with fiue loaues. Chrif. ho. 15. Aug. Tra. 24. in Ioan. S. Tho. p. 1. q. 92. a. 3.
