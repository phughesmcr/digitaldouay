# Genesis

The most probable exposition, saith he, gathered out of the Hebrewes Tradition, is, that Lamech of the line of Cain (for there was an other Lamech of Seths progenie) much addicted to hunting, and his eyes decaying, vsed in that exercise the direction of a young man his nephew, the sonne of Tubalcain. Who seing something moue in bushes, supposing it to be a wild beast, willed his grandfather to shoote at the same: which he did, and stroke the marke with a deadlie wound, and approching to take the pray, found it to be old Cain. Wherevpon sore amazed, afflicted, and moued with great passion, did so beate the young man, for his il direction, that he also died of the drie blowes. After both which mishappes, and his passion at last calmed, Lamech lamenteth as the text saith, that he had killed a man and stripling, to wit, the one with a wound, the other with drie blowes, for which he feared seuenfold punishment more then Cain suffered for killing Abel. Neuertheles S. Hierom & other Fathers thinke it probable, that Lamech killing the one of ignorance, the other in passion, was not so seuerely punished as he feared. And so they vnderstand the rest of this passage, that seuenfold vengeance was taken of Cain, by prolongation of his miserable life til his seuenth generation, when one of his owne line slue him, and an other of the same linage with him. And Lamech was punished seuentie seuen fold when his seuentie seuen children (for so manie he had, as Iosephus writeth) and al their offspring perished in the floud. Mystically by seuentie seuen may be signified that the sinne of mankind should be punished and expiated in Christ our Redeemer who was borne in the seuentie seuenth generation from Adam.

<sup>26</sup> *To Seth also* was borne a sonne, and he called his name Enos. This man began to inuocate the name of our Lord.

<aside>Publique prayer besides Sacrifice in the Church of God.</aside>

[^1] Seth was a most holie man, and so brought vp his children, that they were called the sonnes of God. Gen. 6. Adam also and Eue were penitent, and became great confessors, and are now Sainctes. And so it can not be doubted but amongst other spiritual exercises they prayed and inuocated God. And therefore that which is here said: He (to wit Enos) began or (as the Hebrew hath) then was begunne, to inuocate the name of our Lord, can not be vnderstood of priuate, but of some publique prayer of many meering together about godlie affaires, and seruice of God in some peculiar place dedicated to diuine Seruice, the Church being now growne to a competent multitude. And that besides Sacrifice, which was also before, as appeareth both by Cain & Abel.

*The progenie of Adam, or number of their yeares (with the death of the rest, & translation of Enoch) in the line of Seth, to Noe & his three sonnes.*

<sup>1</sup> This is the booke of the generation of Adam. In the day, when God created man, to the likenes of God made he him. <sup>2</sup> Male and female created he them; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created. <sup>3</sup> And Adam liued a hundred and thirtie yeares; and begat to his owne image and likenes, and called <sup>4</sup> his name Seth.
