uing his doctrine by miracles, said to the Iewes: If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleue me not.

Chap. V.

Moyses and Aaron require of Pharao in the behalfe of God, to let his people the Hebrewes goe and sacrifice in the desert. VVhich he contemning, 5. oppresseth them more, denying them straw, and yet exacting the accustomed number of brickes. 10. The people oppressed impute their miserie to Moyses and Aaron. 22. But Moyses prayeth to God for them.

<sup>1</sup> After these things Moyses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharao: This saith the Lord God of Israel: dismisse my people that they may sacrifice to me in the desert. <sup>2</sup> But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should heare his voice, and dismisse Israel? I know not the Lord, and Israel I wil not dismisse. <sup>3</sup> And they said: The God of the Hebrewes hath called vs, to goe three daies iourney into the wildernesse, and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest perhappes there chance to vs pestilence or sword. <sup>4</sup> The king of Ã†gypt said to them: Why do you Moyses and Aaron solicite the people from their workes? Goe you to your burdens. <sup>5</sup> And Pharao said: The people of the land is much: you see that the multitude is secretly increased: how much more if you geue them rest from their workes? <sup>6</sup> Therefore he commanded in that day the ouerseers of the workes and the exactores of the people, saying: <sup>7</sup> You shal no more geue straw to the people for to make brickes, as before: but let them selues goe and geather straw. <sup>8</sup> And the taske of brickes, which they did before, you shal put vpon them, neither shal you diminish any thing: for they are idle, and therfore they crie, saying: Let vs goe, and sacrifice to our God. <sup>9</sup> Let them be oppressed with workes, and let them accomplish them: that they hearken not to lying wordes. <sup>10</sup> Therefore the ouerseers of the workes and the exactors going forth said vnto the people: Thus saith Pharao: I alow you no straw: <sup>11</sup> goe, and geather if you can find any where:
