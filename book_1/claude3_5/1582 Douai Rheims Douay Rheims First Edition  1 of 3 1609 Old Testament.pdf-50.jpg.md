[^1]

gation are borne the children of wrath, in original sinne contracted from Adam, slaues of the diuel, not only subiect to temporal death, but also excluded for euer from heauenly blisse and glorie: except by Christs redemption particularly applied, they be restored to grace & iustice in this life.

[^2]

And touching Adam and Eue, whose sinne was not original but actual, directly committed by them selues, God: mercie so reclamed them by new grace, that they dispared not (as Cain, and some others did afterwards) but with hope of remission were sorie and penitent, and accordingly receiued penance, and redemption. For God brought Adam from his sinne (*as Sap. 10. holie writte witnesseth*) and the same is collected of Eue, God shewing the like signes of his prouident mercie towards them both, of which we shal by and by note some for example.

Now let vs see the most principal points of faith and Religion professed and obserued by the Church of God before Noes floud. First they beleeued in one Eternal and Omnipotent God, who made the whole world and al things therin of nothing. Which is easily confessed of al that are not plaine Atheists, and may be proued against them by reason. And therfore Adam and other Patriarches could not erre in this Article, nor others be ignorant therof, except they were very wicked.

The Mysterie also of the Blessed Trinitie, three Diuine Persons in one God, though farre aboue the reach of mans reason, yet was beleeued more expresly by some, more implicitly by others, and continued from age to age by tradition, at least amongst the chief heades and leaders. Whereupon Moyses afterwardes insinuated the same great Mysterie, by diuers wordes and phrases, writing of God and his workes. The two wordes God created if they be rightly considered importe so much. For the word Elohim, God, in the plural number, signifieth pluralitie of Persons (for manie Gods it can not signifie, seeing there is but one God) and the verbe bara, created, in the singular number signifieth one God in nature and substance, albeit three Persons. For whatsoever God doth in creatures, is the worke of the whole Trinitie: though holie Scripture do oftentimes appropriate some worke to one Diuine Person, some to an other, which also proueth distinction of Persons in God. So the wordes God created heauen and earth signifie the Father, to whom power is attributed. In the beginning, signifie the Sonne, to whom wisdome is appropriated, and the words, The Sprite of God moued ouer the waters, signifie the Holie Ghost, by whose bountiful goodnes, the waters were made fruitful. Likewise Gods owne words: Let vs make man signifie the pluralitie of Persons; and Image and likenes in the singular number, signifie one God.

Men also knew by faith manie things perteyning to them selues. As that the bodie was made of the slime of the earth: the soule not produced of anie thing
