meate, which you shal eate, if the water be poured vpon it, shal be vncleane: and al liquor that is dronke of al vessel, shal be vncleane. <sup>35</sup> And vpon whatsoever ought of such carcasses falleth, it shal be vncleane: whether ouens, or pottes with feete, they shal be distroyed, and shal be vncleane. <sup>36</sup> But the fountaines and the cisternes, and al collection of waters shal be cleane.

Pollute not your soules in anie creeping beast, that moueth vpon the earth. <sup>45</sup> For I am the Lord, that brought you out of the Land of Ã†gypt, that I might be your God. <sup>46</sup> You shal be holie because I am holie. <sup>47</sup> This is the lawe of beasts and foules, and of euerie liuing soule, that moueth in the waters, and creepeth on the earth, that you may know the differences of the cleane, and the vncleane, and know what you ought to eate, and what to refuse.
