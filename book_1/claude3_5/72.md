CHAP. XII.

[^1] Say therefore] Abraham concealed that Sarai was his wife, and lyed not Gen. 26. in saying, she was his sister: as he also called Lot his brother, being his brothers sonne, and she his brothers daughter. Whereby he preuented danger of his owne life, vsing such lawful meanes as lay in him, committing his wiues ii. 16. c. chastite to Gods protection, which him self could not prouide for. In which 19. ciuit. case if he had not done his owne endeuour, he had rather tempted God (saith S. Augustin) then trusted in God. And so God preserued her, though she was in Pharao his house. v. 17.
