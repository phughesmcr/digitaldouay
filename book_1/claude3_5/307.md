Leprosie:

<sup>29</sup> Man, or woman, in whose head or beard the leprosie riseth, the priest shal see them. <sup>30</sup> and if the place be lower then the other flesh, and the heare yelow, and thinner then it was wont; he shal contaminate them, because it is the leprosie of the heade and the beard. <sup>31</sup> But if he perceiue the place of the spotte equal with the flesh neere vnto it, and the heare blacke: he shal shut him vp seuen daies, <sup>32</sup> and in the seuenth day he shal looke vpon it. If the spotte be not growne, and the heare be of his owne colour, and the place of the plague euen with the other flesh: <sup>33</sup> the man shal be shauen sauing the place of the spotte, and shal be shut vp other seuen daies. <sup>34</sup> If the seuenth day the plague seeme to haue staid in his place, & not lower then the other flesh, he shal cleanse him, and his clothes being washed he shal be cleane. <sup>35</sup> But if after his clensing the spotte be growne againe in the skinne, <sup>36</sup> he shal no more seeke whether the heare be changed into a yelow colour, because he is euidently vnclene. <sup>37</sup> Moreouer if the spotte be staid, & the heare be blacke, let him know that the man is healed, and let him boldly pronounce him cleane. <sup>38</sup> Man, or woman, in whose skinne appeareth whitenesse, <sup>39</sup> the priest shal vew them. If he find that whitnesse somewhat obscure shineth in the skinne, let him know that it is not the leprosie, but a spotte of white colour, and that the man is cleane. <sup>40</sup> The man whose heare falleth of from his head, is bald and cleane: <sup>41</sup> and if the heare fal from his forehead, he is bald before and cleane. <sup>42</sup> But if in the baldnesse or in the baldnesse before there be risen a white or reddish colour, <sup>43</sup> and the priest perceiue this, he shal condemne him vndoubtedly of leprosie, which is risen in the baldnesse. <sup>44</sup> Whosoeuer therefore shal be defiled with leprosie & is separated at the arbitrement of the priest, <sup>45</sup> shal haue his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth couered with a cloth, he shal crie him self polluted and vnclene. <sup>46</sup> Al the time that he is a lepre & vnclene, he shal dwel alone without the campe. <sup>47</sup> A wollen or linnen garment, <sup>48</sup> that shal haue the leprosie in the warpe, and the woufe, <sup>49</sup> or els a skinne, or whatsoeuer is made of a skinne, <sup>50</sup> if it be a white or reddish spott, it shal be reputed infected with leprosie, and shal be shewed to the priest. <sup>51</sup> Who hauing considered it shal shut it vp seuen daies: and the seuenth day againe beholding it, if he find that it is growne, it is a leprosie
