# To the English Reader

fallen out of al Diuines handes, and growne out of credite and vse. If moreouer we consider S. Ieroms lerning, pietie, diligence, and sinceritie, together with the commodities he had of best copies, in al languages then extant, and of other lerned men, with whom he conferred: and if we so compare the same with the best meanes that hath bene since, surely no man of indifferent iudgement, wil match anie other Edition with S. Ieroms: but easely acknowlege with the whole Church Gods particular prouidence in this great Doctor, as wel for expounding, as most especialy for the true text and Edition of Holie Scriptures. Neither do we flee vnto this old Latin text, for more aduantage. For besides that it is free from partialitie, as being most ancient of al Latin copies, and long before the particular Controuersies of these dayes beganne; the Hebrew also & the Greke when they are truly translated, yea and Erasmus his Latin, in sundrie places, proue more plainly the Catholique Romaine doctrine, then this which we relie vpon. So that Beza & his followers take also exception against the Greke, when Catholiques allege it against them. Yea the same Beza preferreth the old Latin Version before al others, & freely testifieth, that the old Interpreter translated religiously. What then do our countriemen, that refuse this Latin, but depriue themselues of the best, and yet al this while, haue set forth none, that is allowed by al Protestantes, for good or sufficient.

How wel this is donne the lerned may iudge, when by mature conference, they shal haue made trial therof. And if anie thing be mistaken, we wil (as stil we promise) gladly correct it. Those that translated it about thirtie yeares since, were wel knowen to the world, to haue bene excellent in the tongues, sincere men, and great Diuines. Only one thing we haue donne touching the text, wherof we are especially to geue notice. That whereas heretofore in the best Latin Editions, there remained manie places diffe-
