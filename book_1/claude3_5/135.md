Jacob, Genesis. 115

difference and distinction of them, and the selected people of God might be more conspicuous, because contraries opposed are seen more clearly. And to the Churches succession and perpetual light, compared with the interrupted and obscure companies, shineth the brighter. For albeit in those other generations there might be manie faithful and just persons, among the infidels and wicked, and of some we are assured (as of Lot and Job) yet faith and religion decayed, and was extinguished in their carnal children, and only continued in the right line from Adam to Jacob, whose twelve sonnes were fathers and beginners of twelve Tribes, and in them the same true Religion was stil conserved and publicly professed, as in the only knowne visible Church, til the coming of Christ. as S. Augustin clearly sheweth in his excellent worke of the Citie of God: especially in the 15. and 16. bookes, in manie chapters.

[^1] *Ada the daughter of Elon*] In the 26. chap. (v. 34.) Esau two wives, which he tooke in Chanaan are called Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hetheite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place, and here the same two wives are named Ada the daughter of Elon the Hetheite, and Oolibama the daughter of Sebeon the Heveite. Which neither agree in names nor countrie. Againe his third wife Ismaels daughter, here named Basemath, in 28. chap v. 9. is called Maheleth. For reconciliation of which and other like difficulties, or seeming contradictions, albeit he lerned expositors say, that either these persons had divers names, or one was true and natural father, an other legal, or adoptive, for there were such also before the law of Moyses, as appeareth in the historie of Thamar: yet it were hard to give a determinate solution of this difficultie. Which example, with manie others (by vs omitted in these briefe annotations) convince the Protestants presumptuous error, holding that Scriptures are easie to be understood.

[^2] *Departed from his brother S. Dwelt in Mount Seir*] Here is an other difficultie (though not so intricate as the former) how Esau now parted into Mount Seir, being he dwelled there, when his brother Jacob came from Mesopotamia. chap. 32. v. 3. Which S. Augustin (q. 119. in Gen.) solveth saying: Esau first dwelt in Seir after he was disappointed of his fathers blessing, but dwelt againe with his father, after Jacobs returne from Mesopotamia, and now went to Seir againe after his fathers death.

Chap. XXXVII.

*Joseph informing his father of his brethrens faults. 5. and telling his dreames, is by them more hated. 13. being sent to visite them, 18. they first thinke to kil him, 26. but by Iudas counsel sel him to the Ismaelites. 29. Ruben lamenteth supposing him to be slaine by some wild beast. 36. He is sold againe to Putiphar in Egypt.*
