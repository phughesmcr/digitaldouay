my goods: <sup>31</sup>Jacob answered: In that I departed vnwitting it
to thee, I feared lest thou wouldest take away thy daughters
by force. <sup>32</sup>But wheras thou chargest me with theft: with
whom soeuer thou shalt find thy goddes, let him be slaine
before our brethren. search, what soeuer of thy things thou
shalt finde with me, and take away. Saying this, he knew
not that Rachel had stollen the idols. <sup>33</sup>Laban therefore
hauing gone into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both
the hand-maides, found them not. And when he was entred
into Rachels tent, <sup>34</sup>she in hast hid the idols vnder the
camels litter, and satte therupon: and when he had sought
al the tent, and found nothing, <sup>35</sup>she said: Let not my
lord be angrie that I can not rise vp before thee, because
