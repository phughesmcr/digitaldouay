MOYSES hauing prosecuted in Genesis, the sacred historie of the church, vnto Iosephs death, containing the space of 2310. yeares, continueth the same in Exodus, for 145. yeares more. Where he first briefly recounteth, how a smal number of Israelites, especially after the death of Ioseph, being much increased, & very potent in the meane time, who were not Ioseph) together with other Ægyptians, enuying their better partes, both of bodie and minde, and more fortunate progres in wealth; fearing also lest they stil multiplying, either by their owne forces, or ioyning with other foreners, might spoile Ægypt, and returne into Chanaan; and hating their religion, because they adored one onlie, eternal, omnipotent God, deriding and detesting the new imaginary goddes of the Ægyptians; resolued and publikely decreed, by oppression to hinder their increasing, & to keepe them in bondage and seruitude. But God almightie, who had chosen them for his peculiar people, did not only so conserue and multiplie them; that in the space of fourscore yeares, which came into Ægypt, in the space of two hundred and seuentene yeares, there were six hundred thousand men, able to beare armes, besides women, children, and old men, which by estimation might be three millions in al, but amongst other most strange and miraculous workes, especially deliuered one Hebrew infant from drowning, whom afterwards he made the Guide, and supreme Gouernour of the same people; by him admonished the King to cease persecuting, and at last wrought plagues him & his people for their obstinate and obstinate cruelties. In fine called away, and mightily deliuered his owne people; drowned that king and al his armie, in the red sea, the Israelites miraculously passing through, as in a drie channel, the waters standing on both sides, like two walles, in the desert fed them miraculously with Manna, and gaue them al necessaries, defending them also from enimies. Then God, hauing thus selected and seuered his people from al other nations, gaue them a written law, as wel of Moral, as Ceremonial and Iudicial precepts, with the maner of making the Tabernacle, erecting Altars, consecrating Priestes, with the institution of daylie sacrifices, and of yearelie Pasches, & other holie thinges belonging to the seruice of God. So this booke may be diuided into three partes. First is declared the Israelites seruile affliction in Ægypt, with their deliuerie from thence: in the first six chapters. Then how they were maintained in the desert, and prepared to receiue a law: in the foure next chapters. In the other 21. chapters, the law is prescribed, instructing them how to liue towardes God, and al men.
