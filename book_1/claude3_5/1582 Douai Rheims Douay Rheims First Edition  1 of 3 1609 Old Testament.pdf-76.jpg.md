[^1] A probable opinion that Sem and Melchisedech was al one.

[^2] More probable that Melchisedech was a Chananite.

[^3] Proued by S. Pauls wordes.

[^4] Christ is a Priest according to the order of Melchisedech.

[^5] Why the Protestants haue no ministers and no Priests

[^6] The state of the controuerſie.

besides these heresies the same S. Hierom relateth two probable opinions. The Iewes Rabins generally hold that Melchisedech was Sem the sonne of Noe from whom Abraham and al the Hebrewes descended. Which they seme rather to affirme, as loath to confesse that anie man, of other nation then their owne, should haue bene greater and more excellent then Abraham in spiritual causes, then for anie reason they do, or can alleage. Yet manie especially latter writers as Liranus, Tostatus, Genebrardus and others do embrace this opinion as most probable. Though S. Hierom semeth only to haue added to the Hebrewes opinion (as he saith) because he would intimate al to his freinds, when he had first cited grauer authores, S.S. Ireneus, Hypolitus, Eusebius Cesariensis, Eusebius Emissenus, Apollinarius, and Eustathius, al agreeing and affirming that Melchisedech was a Chananite, king of Salem, which was afterwards called Ierusalem. To this opinion agreeth Philo Iudæus continually speaking of him, as of a stranger to the Iewes nation. Iosephus also a Iew writeth plainly (*l. 7. de bello Iudaico. c. 18.*) that he was of Chanaan, and Prince of the Chananites. Also S. Dionysius Areopagita, (*celest. Hier. c. 9.*) S. Epiphanius (*her. 55. & 67.*) Theodoretus (*q. 64. in Gen.*) and Suidas, are of the same mind, and manie other christian Doctors. Who confirme their assertion by that S. Paul saith to the Hebrewes: *He whose genealogie is not numbred among them, Heb. 7. tooke tithes of Abraham*. For wheras els can S. Paul meane, but that Melchisedechs kinred and people, was diuers from the kinred, and people of the Iewes? which he could not say of Sem, from whom Abraham & al Iewes descended: as it can not be said, that Adam and Noe are of diuers generation from anie people that now liueth, because we al come of them. Of this difficultie (not pertaining to anie controuersie of our time) the studious may see more in F. Pererius his commentaries vpon this 14. chap. of Genesis. disp. 3.

<sup>18</sup> *Bringing forth*] Being the Royal Prophet Dauid, and S. Paul say Christ *Psal. 109. is a Priest for euer according to the order of Melchisedech*, we demand of Pro- Heb. 7. testants, if Christ fulfilled not Melchisedechs figuratiue Sacrifice offered in bread and wine, by offering his owne bodie and bloud at his last supper in forme of bread & wine, and by instituting the same to be offered by Priests til the end of the world, what other figuratiue sacrifice of Melchisedech they can find performed by Christ, by which it may appeare that he is a Priest for euer according to that order? Caluin (li. 4. Instit. c. 18. para 2.) Kemnisius (par. 2. exam. pag. 740. & 747) Peter martyr (in 1. Cor. 5.) and most English Protestants grant that Melchisedech was a Priest, and that the peculiar function of a Priest is to offer Sacrifice, wherfore they hauing no Sacrifice wil haue only ministers and no Priests, but they denie that Melchisedech offered Sacrifice of bread and wine. Wherupon we ioyne issue with them to proue that he did: and that by this place amongst others of holie Scripture.

First we complayne that in the Latin text hath *Obtulit* for *Protulit*, offered, for brought forth. And to dispose the same he alleageth the Hebrew, Chaldee, Greke, and S. Cyprian. But Catholiques more iustly complaine of him, for lying in so al Latin Editions haue *Proferens*, bringing forth. The question therfore is controuersie is, to what end and vse Melchisedech brought forth bread and wine? Caluin and Kemnisius say it was only to refresh or feede Abraham and his men, and not for sacrifice. which their bare saying is without reason, for that there was store of victuals in the pray (v. 11.) and they had eaten therof. v. 24. Moreouer the Hebrew word *iaza*, brought forth, is a word of sacrifice, as in the 6. chap of Iudges. (v. 18. and 19.) and importeth that the bread *ho. 36. in and wine were first offered in sacrifice, and then doubtles they did participate Gen.*
