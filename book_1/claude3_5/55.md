inclination to the bodie, mans natural perfection requireth the coniunction
of bodie and soule. for neither soule nor bodie separated is a man, but both
ioyned in one subsistence are a man, in so much that mankind should perish,
except the bodies shal rise againe, and liue with the soules. And then shal
the bodies be qualified according to the state of the soules, happie or misera-
ble for euer.

<sup>5</sup> Of Eternal life the translation of Enoch is a figure. For seeing God pre-
serueth his corruptible bodie so long from death and infirmitie, it is a token
and manifest signe, that by the same powre of God, the bodies of men shal
at last day, after that al men are once dead, rise againe, and remaine with
the soules for euer. The good in Eternal ioy: the wicked in Eternal paine.
<sup>24</sup> Both signified by the custodie of the gate of Paradise by Angels; who for
euer kepe out those, that are stil defiled with sinne, and so they depart into
fire euerlasting, and admit the innocent and iust into the kingdome of hea-
uen, which is euerlasting ioy and perfect felicitie.

Thus we see the face and briefe summe of Religion, in the beginning of
the world, in the floud: and the state of the Church, which was alwayes
Visible, consisting of men good and bad, with a continual Succession of
Rulers, as wel spiritual as temporal. For the first borne were both Priestes and
Princes in euerie familie. And amongst the same one euer chiefe of al: from
which ranke Cain was excluded, or rather excluded him selfe, by Going
forth from the face of our Lord. Wherupon holie Moyses reciteth this
Monarchical succession of one chiefe, and Supreme Head, from Adam by
the line of Seth, Enos, Cainan, Malaleel, Iared, Enoch, Mathu-
sala, Lamech, and Noe. Neuertheles he setteth downe also the progenie
of Cain, the first beginner of a worldlie, schismatical, and heretical co-
uentide, opposite to the Citie of God. He denied Gods prouidence (as
Thargum Hierosolimitanum testifieth) protesting to Abel, That there
was no Iustice nor Iudge, nor other world then this, no re-
ward for vertue, nor punishment for sinne, and so desperat-
ly he killed Abel. Of these negatiue principles proceded other like
detestable opinions, and most wicked life, sauage and barbarous cruel-
tie, and al kind of impietie. And in processe of time albeit manie
remained in true faith, and vnitie of the Church, yet by conuersation
with such miscreantes, especially by occasion of Mariages betwen the
faithful and infidels, almost the whole world was corrupted in maners.
But Noe was iust and perfect. In punishment therefore of so great and enor-
mious sinnes, God sent the general floud, wherby al Cains progenie, and al
other infidels were wholly destroyed and extinguished, and the true Church
notably purged; onlie iust Noe and his familie reserued. By whom the same
true Church was continued, and the world againe replenished with men.
