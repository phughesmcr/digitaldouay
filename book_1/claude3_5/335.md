<sup>1</sup> for I am the Lord your God. <sup>2</sup> Keepe my sabbathes, and dread my Sanctuarie. I the Lord. <sup>3</sup> If you walke in my preceptes, and keepe my commandementes, and doe them, I wil geue you raine in their seasons, <sup>4</sup> and the earth shal bring forth her spring, and the trees shal be replenished with fruites. <sup>5</sup> The threshing of your haruest shal reach vnto vintage, and the vintage shal reach vnto sowing time: and you shal eate your bread to your fil, and without feare dwel in your land. <sup>6</sup> I wil geue peace in your coastes: you shal sleepe, and there shal be none to make you afraid. I wil take away euil beastes: and the sword shal not passe through your quarters. <sup>7</sup> You shal pursue your enemies, and they shal fal before you. <sup>8</sup> fiue of yours shal pursue an hundred strangers, and an hundred of you tenne thousand: your enemies shal fal by the sword in your sight. <sup>9</sup> I wil respect you, and make you encrease: you shal be multiplied, and I wil establish my couenant with you. <sup>10</sup> You shal eate the eldest of the old store, and new coming vpon it you shal cast forth the old. <sup>11</sup> I wil sette my tabernacle in the middes of you, and my soule shal not cast you of. <sup>12</sup> I wil walke among you, and wil be your God, and you shal be my people. <sup>13</sup> I the Lord your God: that haue brought you out of the Land of the Aegyptians, that you should not serue them, and that haue broken the chaines of your neckes, that you might goe vpright. <sup>14</sup> But if you wil not heare me, nor doe al my commandements, <sup>15</sup> if you dispise my lawes, and contemne my iudgementes that you do not those thinges which are appointed by me, and bring my couenant to nothing worth: <sup>16</sup> I also wil do these thinges to you: I shal quickly visite you with pouertie, and burning heat, which shal waist your eies, and consume your liues. you shal sowe your seede in vaine, which shal be deuoured of the enemies. <sup>17</sup> I wil sette my face against you, and you shal fal downe before your enemies, and shal be made subiect to them that hate you. you shal flee, when no man pursueth you. <sup>18</sup> But if you wil not obey me so neither, I wil increase your chastisementes seuen fould for your sinnes, <sup>19</sup> and wil breake the pride of your stubburneffe. and I wil make to you the heauen from aboue as iron, and the earth as brasse. <sup>20</sup> Your labour shal be spent in vaine, the earth shal not bring forth her spring, nor the trees yeld their fruites. <sup>21</sup> If you walke contrarie to me,

<aside>haue an image of Christ, or Sainctes, to be the grauen thing, which is forbidden in holie Scripture: & therefore falsly translate, post agreemet with the Hebrewes, where in deede it signifieth an image, picture or portrature of an idol. that is, a grauen idol. So here as in other places, it is forbid to make an idol, or similitude of anie idol;</aside>
