haue serued thee, and how great thy possession hath benne
in my hands. <sup>30</sup> Thou hadest a smal thing before I came
to thee, and now thou art made rich: and our Lord hath
blessed thee at my comming in. It is reason therfore that
<sup>31</sup> once I prouide also for mine owne house. <sup>32</sup> And Laban
said: What shal I geue thee? But he said: I wil nothing:
but if thou wilt doe that which I demande, I wil fede, and
kepe thy sheepe again. <sup>32</sup> Goe round about al thy flockes,
and separate al the shepe of diuers colours, of speckled flyte:
and what soeuer shal be russet and spotted, and of diuers
colours, aswell in the shepe, as in the goates, shal be my
wages. <sup>33</sup> And my iustice shal answer for me to morowe,
before thee when the time of the bargaine shal come: and
al that shal not be of diuers colours, and spotted, and russet,
aswell in the shepe as in the goates, shal accuse me of theft.
<sup>34</sup> And Laban said: I like wel that thou demandest.
<sup>35</sup> And he separated the same day the shee goates, and the
shepe, and the he goates, and the rammes of diuers colours,
and spotted: and al the flocke of one coloure, that is of white
and blacke flyte, he deliuered in the hand of his sonnes.
<sup>36</sup> And he put a space of three dayes iourney betwixt him
<sup>37</sup> and his sonne in lawe, who fed the rest of his flocke. <sup>37</sup> Ia-
cob therfore taking greene roddes of the poplare, and of
the almond, and of the plane trees, in part pilled them:
and when the barkes were taken of, in the parts that were
pilled, there appeared whitnes: but the parts that were
whole, remayned grene: and by this meanes the colour was
<sup>38</sup> made diuers. <sup>38</sup> And he put them in the troughes, where
the water was poured out: that when the flockes should
come to drinke, they might haue the roddes before their
<sup>39</sup> eyes, and in the sight of them conceaue. <sup>39</sup> And it came to
passe that in the verie heate of the rammes going to the sheepe
beheld the roddes, and brought forth spotted, and of diuers
<sup>40</sup> colours, and speckled. <sup>40</sup> And Iacob diuided the flocke, and
put the roddes in the troughes before the eyes of the ram-
mes: and al the white and the blacke were Labans: and the
rest, Iacobs, when the flockes were separated one from the
<sup>41</sup> other. <sup>41</sup> Therefore when the ewes went to ramme, in the
prime time, Iacob put the roddes in the troughes of water
before the eyes of the rammes, and of the ewes, that in
<sup>42</sup> looking vpon them they might conceaue: <sup>42</sup> but when the
