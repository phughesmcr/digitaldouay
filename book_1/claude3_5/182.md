Exodus.

Martyr (in expl. 33. num. 9. 141.) saith, al those Angels, which haue appeared in Gods place, or haue spoken with men, haue also benne called by the name of God, as he that spoke with Iob, and with Moyses. S. Augustin after a large discourse of this matter, in his second, third, and fourth bookes de Trinitate, hath these wordes: (li. 4. c. vlt.) If it be demanded of me, how either the voices, or sensible formes, and shewes were made before the incarnation of the word of God, which prefigured the same, I answer that God wrought them by Angels, which also I suppose I haue sufficiently shewed by testimonies of holie Scriptures. Likewise S. Gregorie (Prefat. in Iob. c. 2.) saith plainly, that an Angel appeared to Moyses in the fire bush, yet is called God, because he was the legate of God, and therfore spoke, as if God himselfe had spoke in diuine Person, explicating the same by two examples, Dauid (saith he) prophesied saying: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. Neither doth he truly say, that he is God, nor by that he sayeth, doth he goe from the rule of truth. He also confirmeth the same doctrine, li. 28. Moral. ca. 5. And further teacheth that Angels protect men, and execute Gods wil in this inferior world. And so do the other Doctors of the Church S. Gregorie Nazianze, orat. ad 150. episcop. & orat. 2. de theologia, in fine ratiosque. S. Basil. li. 3. cont. Eunom. S. Athanasius. ser. 4. cont. Arian, longius a princ. & Epist. de Sinon, Dionys. Alexan. in fine. S. Ambrose, ser. 1. in psal. 118. S. Chrysost. ho. 6. and S. Hierom. li. 3. comment. in Mat. 18.

[^1]: God executeth his wil by angels.

14. I am which am,] Al other things, besides God, once were not; and being are limited in nature; neither could persist vnles God conserued them; manie things also haue lost, or shal lose their proper essence and being, and whiles they remaine haue continual alterations. Onlie God eternally is without beginning, ending, limitation, dependence, or mutation, consisting only of himselfe, and al other things are of him Therfore this name, QVI EST, HE WHICH IS, is most proper to God, not determining anie maner, but indeterminately signifying al maners of being, for so it importeth the very infinite immenstitie of Gods substance. S. Damascen. li. 1. c. 12. Orthodoxe fidei. S. Tho. p. 1. q. 13. a. 11.

[^2]: The most proper name of God is, HE WHICH IS.

CHAP. IIII.

Moyses receiuing power to worke miracles in confirmation of his mission, 14. and his brother Aaron being designed to assist him, 20. goeth with wyfe and children towards Ã†gypt, 25. is in danger to be slaine for not sooner circumcising his sonne. 27. Aaron meeteth him, 29. so they goe together, and declare to the people, that God wil deliuer them.

<sup>1</sup>MOYSES answering said: They wil not beleue me, nor heare my voice, but they wil say: Our Lord hath not appeared to thee. <sup>2</sup>Therfore he sayd to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rodde. <sup>3</sup>And our Lord sayd: Cast it vpon the ground. He did cast it, and it was turned into a serpent, so that Moyses fled. <sup>4</sup>And our
