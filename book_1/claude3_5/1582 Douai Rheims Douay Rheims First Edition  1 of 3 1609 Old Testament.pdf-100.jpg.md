hands, and had heard al her words reporting: These words
spake the man vnto me: he came to the man which stoode
beside the camels, and nighe to the fountaine of water:
<sup>31</sup> and said to him: Come in, thou blessed of our Lord: why
standest thou without? I haue prepared the house, and a
place for the camels. <sup>32</sup> And he brought him in into his
lodging: and he vnharnessed the camels, and gaue strawe
and hay, and water to wash his feet, and of the men that
were come with him. <sup>33</sup> And bread was set before him.
Who said: I wil not eate, til I speake my message. He answered him: Speake. <sup>34</sup> And he said: I am the seruant of
Abraham: <sup>35</sup> and our Lord hath blessed my lord wonderfully, and he is magnified: and he hath geuen him sheepe,
and oxen, siluer and gold, men seruants and women seruants,
camels, and asses. <sup>36</sup> And Sara my lordes wife hath borne
my lord a sonne in her old age, and he hath geuen him al
things that he had. <sup>37</sup> And my lord adiured me saying: Thou

whose land I dwel: <sup>38</sup> but thou shalt goe to my fathers house,

they wil not geue her thee. <sup>42</sup> I came therefore to day to
the wel of water, and said: O Lord God of my lord Abraham,
if thou hast directed my way, wherin I now walke, <sup>43</sup> behold I stand besides the wel of water, and the virgin, that
shal come forth to drawe water, when she shal heare me
say: Geue me a litle water to drinke of thy tankard: <sup>44</sup> and
she shal say to me: Drinke both thou and for thy camels I
wil draw: the same is the woman, which our Lord hath
prepared for my maisters sonne. <sup>45</sup> And whilest I pondered
these things secretly with my selfe, Rebecca appeared comming with a tankard, which she caried vpon her shoulder:
and she went downe to the fountaine, & drew water.
And I said to her: Geue me a litle to drinke. <sup>46</sup> Who speedely let downe the tankard from her shoulder, and said to
me: Drinke both thou, and to thy camels I wil geue drinke.
I dranke,
