## CHAP. XXIIII.

<aside>A figure of Christs bloud in the B. Sacrament.</aside>

5. *This is the bloud of the couenant:*] Our Sauiour in the institution of the Eucharist, by vsing the same wordes, applying them to himselfe, *This is my bloud of the new Testament*, signifieth that he fulfilled this figure at his last supper. Which proueth both a Sacrifice of bloud then offered by him, as this bloud of the old Testament was already shed, when Moyses pronounced those wordes; and the real presence of Christs bloud. For els, if it were but wine, it were not better in substance then the figure, which was real bloud.

[^1]: Ioshua. II. v. 4. in Leuit.
