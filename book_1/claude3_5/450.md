Of the first borne, that come forth in thy heardes and sheepe, whatsoeuer is of the male sexe, thou shalt sanctifie to our Lord thy God. Thou shalt not worke with the first borne of an oxe, and thou shalt not sheare the first borne of thy sheepe. <sup>20</sup> In the sight of our Lord thy God shalt thou eate them euerie yeare in the place, that our Lord shal choose, thou and thy house. <sup>21</sup> But if it haue blemish, and be either lame, or blind, or in any part disfigured or feeble, it shal not be immolated to our Lord thy God. <sup>22</sup> but within the gates of thy citie shalt thou eate it: as wel the cleane as the vncleane in like maner shal eate them as the doa, and the hart. <sup>23</sup> This onlie shalt thou obserue, that their bloud thou eate not, but powre it out on the earth as water.
