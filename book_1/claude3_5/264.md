to whom thou swarest by thine owne self, saying: I wil mul-
tiplie your seed as the starres of heauen: and this whole land,
wherof I haue spoken, I wil giue to your seed, and you shal
possesse it alwayes. <sup>14</sup> And our Lord was pacified from doing
the euil which he had spoken against his people. <sup>15</sup> And
Moyses returned from the mount, carying the two tables of
testimonie in his hand, written on both sides, <sup>16</sup> and made
by the worke of God: the writing also of God was grauen
in the tables. <sup>17</sup> And Iosue hearing the tumult of the people
crying out, said to Moyses: The noyse of battaile is heard in
the campe. <sup>18</sup> Who answered: It is not the crie of men en-
couraging to fight, nor the shoute of men compelling to flee:
but I doe heare the voice of singers. <sup>19</sup> And when he appro-
ched to the campe, he saw the calfe, and the daunces: and
being very wrath, he threw the tables out of his hand, and
brake them at the foote of the mount. <sup>20</sup> and catching the
calfe which they had made, he burnt it, and bette it into
powder, which he strawed into water, and gaue thereof
drinke to the children of Israel. <sup>21</sup> And he said to Aaron:
What hath this people done to thee, that thou shouldest bring
vpon them an heinous sinne? <sup>22</sup> To whom he answered: Let
not my lord be offended: for thou knowest this people, that
it is prone to euil: <sup>23</sup> they said to me: Make vs goddes, that
may goe before vs: for vnto this same Moyses, that brought
vs forth out of the Land of Ã†gypt, we know not what is
chanced. <sup>24</sup> To whom I said: Which of you hath gold? They
tooke, and brought to me: and I cast it into the fire, and
this calfe came forth. <sup>25</sup> Moyses therfore seeing the people
that they were made naked (for Aaron had spoiled them for
the ignominie of filth, and had set them naked among their
enemies) <sup>26</sup> and standing in the gate of the campe, he said: If
any man be our Lords, let him ioyne to me. And there gathe-
red vnto him al the sonnes of Leui: <sup>27</sup> to whom he said:
This saith the Lord God of Israel: Put euerie man his sword
vpon his thigh: goe, & returne from gate to gate through the
middes of the campe, and euerie man kil his brother, and
freind, and neighbour. <sup>28</sup> And the sonnes of Leui did accor-
ding to the saying of Moyses, and there were slaine in that day
about three thousand men. <sup>29</sup> And Moyses said: You haue
consecrated your handes this day to our Lord, euerie man in
his sonne & in his brother, that blessing may be giuen to you

<aside>Moyses the meekest man on earth. (Nu. 12.) in Gods cause was most zelous against sinne.</aside>
