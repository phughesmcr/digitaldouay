# Deuteronomie.

<sup>21</sup> Thou shalt cleave, and shalt sweare in his name. He is thy praise, and thy God, that hath done for thee these greate and terrible thinges, which thyne eies haue seene. <sup>22</sup> In seuentie soules did thy fathers goe downe into Ægypt: and behold now the Lord thy God hath multiplied thee as the starres of heauen.

<aside>When iust cause requireth oath, it must be made in the name of God, not of false goddes.</aside>

## Chap. XI.

*For the benefites of God (wherof some are repeted, and others promised) the Israelites are bound to loue him. 16. but if they forsake him he threateneth punishmentes, 26. proposing benediction and malediction as they shal deserue.*
