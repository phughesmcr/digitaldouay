<sup>30</sup> And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not geue vs pas-
sage: because the Lord thy God had indurated his spirit, and
hardened his hart, that he might be deliuered into thy
handes, as now thou seest. <sup>31</sup> And our Lord said to me: Be-
hold I haue begunne to deliuer Sehon vnto thee, and his land,
beginne to possesse it. <sup>32</sup> And Sehon came forth to meete vs
with al his people to battel in Iasa. <sup>33</sup> And the Lord our God
deliuered him to vs: and we smote him with his sonnes and
al his people. <sup>34</sup> And al his cities we tooke at that time, killing
the inhabiters therof, men and women and litle ones. we
left nothing among them. <sup>35</sup> Except the cattel, which came
to their portion that tooke prayes: and the spoyles of the
cities, which we tooke <sup>36</sup> from Aroer, which is vpon the
banke of the torrent Arnon, a towne that is situated in a
valley, as farre as Galaad. There was not a village or citie,
that escaped our handes: the Lord our God deliuered al vnto
vs. <sup>37</sup> Except the land of the children of Ammon, to the
which we approched not: and al that adioyne to the torrent
Ieboc, and the cities on the mountaine, and al the places,
from which the Lord our God prohibited vs.

THERFORE turning we went vp by the way of Basan:
and Og the king of Basan came forth to meete vs with
his people to fight in Edrai. <sup>2</sup> And our Lord said to me: Feare
him not: because he is deliuered into thy hand with al his
people and his land: and thou shalt doe to him as thou hast
done to Sehon king of the Amorrheites, that dwelt in He-
sebon. <sup>3</sup> Therfore the Lord our God deliuered into our
handes Og also the king of Basan, and al his people: and we
stroke them to vtter destruction, <sup>4</sup> wasting al his cities at
one time. there was not a towne that escaped vs: sixtie cities,
al the countrie of Argob the kingdome of Og in Basan. <sup>5</sup> Al
the cities were fensed with verie high walles, and with gates
and barres, beside innumerable townes that had no walles.
<sup>6</sup> And we destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king
of Hesebon, destroying euerie citie, and men and women
