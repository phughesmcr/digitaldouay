ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. VI.

<aside>It perteined not to Moyses present purpose, to prosecute the genealogies of Iacobs other sonnes, being come to the origin of the Priestly tribe in Leui the third sone.</aside>

<aside>In place of the name of God counted ineffable, is commonly redde *Adonai*,</aside>

[^1] My name Adonai] Here and in manie other places of holie Scripture in the Hebrew text, is that name of God of foure letters, which the Iewes say is ineffable. Yet sure it is, that Moyses heard it pronounced, and afterwards wrote it as he did the rest in Hebrew letters (which are al consonants) without vowels. But the Rabbins that long after put points or vowels to al other words, put none to this. For al the Latin, and vulgar Catholique versions, keepe the same word vntranslated. The Septuagint in Greeke translate ΚΥΡΙΟΣ, which in Latin is *Dominus*, in English *Lord*. So also al ancient Fathers, and (which is most of al) our Sauiour, and his Apostles, alleaging sentences of the old Testament, where this name is contained, stil expresse it by words that signifie *Lord*. Only certaine late writers haue framed a new word, by putting the points of *Adonai*, to the proper letters of this vnknowen name, which are *Iod*, *He*, *Vau*, *He*, and so found it *Iehouah*: which was neuer heard of before an hundred yeares. As Bishop Genebrard, Cardinal Bellarmin, and F. Pererius proue, for that neither ancient Fathers, Hierom. writing whole Treatises *de Diuinis nominibus*, nor the elder Rabbins, nor later Theologians, most learned Hebricians, as Rabbi Moyses, Aben Ezram, Lira, Paulus Burgensis rel. De- and others, neuer mention *Iehouah* amongst the Names or titles of God.
