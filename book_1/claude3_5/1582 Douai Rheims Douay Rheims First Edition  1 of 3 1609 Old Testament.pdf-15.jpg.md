# THE SUMME AND PARTITION OF THE HOLIE BIBLE.

With a briefe note of the Canonical and
Apochryphal Bookes.

<aside>S. Ierom. epist. ad Paulin. de omnib S. Scrip. libris.</aside>

By the uniforme consent of al learned Divines, the holie Bible, or written word of God, conteyneth expressed or implied, al thinges that man is to beleue, to obserue, or to auoid, for obtaining eternal saluation. That is, al matters of faith or maners, by which we may know and serue God, and be spiritually ioyned with him, in this life, & in eternitie. For both the old & new Testament propose and testifie vnto vs, one and the same God, the same Christ, the same Church, and other Mysteries of our beleue, and discipline: in the old more obscurely in figures and prophecies foretelling those thinges, which the New declareth (in great part) as donne and performed. Wherupon saith S. Augustin: In the Old Testament the New lieth hidden: & in the New the Old lieth open. The old more obscurely, the same Doctor) is called the old Testament, either because it proposeth promises of temporal thinges (Wherewith our old corruption is allured) Or in respect of the New, by which it is fulfilled, and in some part abolished. The other is called the New, because by it man is renewed, and hath promise of eternal life: Which shal neuer waxe old nor decay. Likewise S. Gregorie the great testifieth this conformitie, and correspondence betwene the old and New Testament, affirming that the same is signified by the Prophet Ezechiels vision of a wheele, which had foure faces, or appearance of foure wheeles, the shape whereof was, as it were, a wheele in the middes of a wheele. What is this (saith he, nisi quod in Testamenti veteris litera Testamentum nouum latuit per Allegoriam) but that in the letter of the old Testament, the New lay hidden by an Allegorie?

And as the same is the summe and subject of both Testaments: so both are diuided (for the more principal partes therof) into foure sortes of Bookes: Legal, Historical, Sapiential, & Prophetical.
