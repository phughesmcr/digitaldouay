*Jacob with his sonnes being come into Gessen, Pharao granteth them the same place to dwel in. 13 The famine forceth the Ægyptians to sel al their goods, landes, and possessions to the king, 22. except the Priests part, to whom the king aloweth necessarie foode without paying for it. 27. After seuentene yeares Iacob adiureth Ioseph, to burie him amongst his ancesters.*
