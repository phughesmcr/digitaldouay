ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. XXVIII.

<aside>Why Iacob traueled in poore state.</aside>

11. *Tooke (of the stones)*] Iacob traueling into a strange countrie went in such poore state, the better to hide his departure from Esau, who otherwise might haue killed him by the way. It was also thus disposed by God, that Iacobs faith and confidence might, to his greater merite, be exercised: and that Gods prouidence might more manifestly appeare, as it did in his returne after twentie yeares, when with most gratefull mind he recounted Gods benefites saying (Gen. 32.) With my staffe I passed ouer this Iordan, and now with two troupes I doe returne.

<aside>A notable example of Gods comforth to the afflicted. Al nations beleeuing in Christ are blessed in him.</aside>

12. *A ladder*] He that was in temporal distresse, was maruelously comforted spiritually, by seing a ladder that reached from the earth to heauen; Angels passing vp and downe the same, and the Sonne of God leaning vpon it, as he that reacheth both in heauen and earth, who in particular promised him, and his sede that whole land, that he and his sede should be blessed, yea that in his sede al nations should be blessed, and that he would kepe and protect him wheresoeuer he went. How al this was performed is briefly rehearsed in the booke of wisdom. chap. 10.

<aside>Erecting and annointing of Altares is a religious office being done to Gods honour. The Church setteth vp Altares, but not to Idolaters, but they of the Church. Difference of religious, superstitious, & of ciuil honour consisteth in the persons, & intentions.</aside>

18. *Erecting, powring oyle*] To erect a stone, and powre oyle vpon it, was no wise superstitious in Iacob. Neither did he lerne it of Idolaters: for he abhorred and detested al idolatrical obseruances. But as S. Iustinus Martyr S. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius and others testifie, idolatrical superstition did rather imitate true religious ceremonies. For the diuel alwayes affecting that honour, which he seeth done to God, perswaded those whom he seduced, and blinded with errors, to serue him in such maner of external rites, as God was serued, that therby he might either haue like worship with God, as it happened among Paiuim Idolaters: or els depriue God of this kind of honour, as now we see Protestants reiect and pul downe consecrated Altares, pretending them to be superstitious. Wherin they shew most grosse ignorance, if in dede they so iudge of ignorance, and not of mere malice. For who is so simple, but he may see, that the chiefe difference betwene Religion and Superstition in external thinges, consisteth in the persons to whom they are done, & in the intention of the doers, & by the same difference of persons ciuil honour is also distinguished, from both religious and superstitious. As he that kneeleth to God, religiously honoreth God. Kneeling to the same, for some false cause, superstitiously honoreth the diuel. So kneeling to the King, ciuilly honoreth the King; Iacob without doubt did al to Gods onlie honour. And that which he did in this place, is now vsed in the
