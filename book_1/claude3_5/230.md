in so great a multitude, the same measure was sufficient and no more, to euerie one young and old, and of middle age. Eightly the heate of the sunne melted and consumed that which remained in the field, though otherwise it indured heate of the fire, seething in water, grinding in milles, and beating in morters. Ninthly, it tasted to euerie one, what they desired. Tenthly, it seemed neuerthelesse to the euil minded, loathsome and light meate, but pleasant to the good. Eleuenthly, part of it was kept in the Arke by Gods commandment, and was not corrupted in manie hundreth yeares. Twelfthly, this strange and extraordinarie prouision, continued fourtie yeares, that is, til the children of Israel came to the promised land and then ceased.

[^1] You see then (o miraculous a figure farre excelled Zuinglius, or Caluins communion bread, which containeth no miracle at al, only signifying Christs bodie. But, as our Sauiours owne wordes importe, and ancient fathers teach vs, by Manna was prefigured Christs verie bodie and bloud, with his soule and Diuinitie vnder the forme of bread.

[^2] For this indeede infinitly excellent Manna, containing al the foresaid, or rather much more eminent miracles. For (first) it was consecrated by the maruelous power of Christs word, and euer since the same is done, by the like power communicated to Priestes, (2) in his Church militant, (3) one and the verie same, and not manie, in innumerable places, and in euerie lesse or greater forme, yea in the least particle of the accidents that may be, Christ is whole and entire. (4). It geueth abundance of grace in this life, signified by the day before the Sabbath, for the glorie of the next life in eternal rest. (5) where is no more vse of Sacraments, but euerlasting fruition of glorie (6) Who so euer therfore would make temporal commoditie of this heauenlie foode, as it were reseruing Manna for other dayes of the weke, it perisheth to him, and turneth to his ignominie, but being reserued in the faithful soule, for the life to come, which is the true Sabbath, it remaineth an heauenlie treasure. (7) And so it auaileth to euerie one, as their soule, which is the spiritual stomake of supernatural meate, is lesse or more disposed. (8) Though heate of persecution, and other aduerse power take away this Sacrament and Sacrifice, abrode in the field of this world, yet no power extinguisheth it within the Church; where it is in due maner prepared and ministred to the children of God. (9). where it yeldeth al comfort, strength and contentment to good spiritual desires, (10) but to the incredulous Capharnaites seemeth vnpossible, and to carnal conceiptes loathsome (11) Being worthely receiued into our mortal bodies, our arke or temporal tabernacle, it remaineth in incorruptible effect, wherby the bodie shalbe raised againe from death, and together with the soule be eternally glorified. (12) In the meane time of this pilgrimage of mankind, it is our way-faring special prouision, dailie and supersubstantial bread, til we shal possesse the promised land, the kingdome of heauen in eternal blisse.

The people murmuring againe in Raphidim for want of drinck, our Lord giueth them water out of a rock. 8. Amalech fighteth with them. And Moyses lifting vp his hand in prayer, Israel overcometh, otherwise Amalech preuaileth.
