<sup>2</sup>And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver. <sup>3</sup>And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south unto Bethel, even to the place where before he had pitched a tabernacle between Bethel and Hay: <sup>4</sup>in the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he called upon the name of our Lord.

<sup>5</sup>But Lot also that was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, <sup>6</sup>and herds of beasts, and tents. <sup>7</sup>Neither was the land able to receive them, for to dwell together: for their substance was much, and they could not dwell together. <sup>7</sup>Whereupon also there arose strife amongst the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And that time the Chananite and the Pherisitie dwel- <sup>8</sup>led in that countrie. Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no brawle I beseech thee between me and thee, and between my herdsmen, and thy herdsmen: for we be brethren. <sup>9</sup>Behold the whole land is before thee: goe aparte from me, I pray thee: if thou wilt goe to the left hand, I wil take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I wil passe to the left.

<sup>10</sup>Lot therefore lifting up his eyes, sawe al the countrie about Iordaine, which was watered through out before that our Lord subverted Sodome and Gomorre, as the paradise of <sup>11</sup>our Lord, and like as Egypt as men come unto Segor. And Lot chose unto him the countrie about Iordaine, and he departed from the East: and they were seperated either brother <sup>12</sup>from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and Lot abode in the townes, that were about Iordaine, and <sup>13</sup>dwelt in Sodome. And the men of Sodome were verie wicked, and sinners before the face of our Lord out of mea- <sup>14</sup>sure. And our Lord said to Abram, after that Lot was seperated from him: Lyft up thyn eyes, and looke from the place, wherin thou now art, to the north and south, to the <sup>15</sup>east and west. <sup>16</sup>Al the land, which thou seest, wil I geue to thee, & to thy seede for euer. And I wil make thy seede as the dust of the earth: if any man be able to number the dust of the earth, thy seede also shal he be able to number. <sup>17</sup>Arise and walke through the land in the length, and in <sup>18</sup>the breath thereof: for I wil geue it to thee. Abram therefore remouing his tent, came, and dwelt beside the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron: and he builded there an altar to our Lord.
