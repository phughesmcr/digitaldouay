[^1] Christ stil exerciseth the office of Priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech by the ministerie of Priests.

[^2] The ancient fathers proue that Melchisedech offered Sacrifice in bread & wine as a figure of Christ, and of other Priests of the new Testament.

perpetual bread & wine, which commandment to his Apostles and Priests to do the same til the end of the world? Let the indifferent reader weigh it wel. And whosoever is not very proud wil for his better instruction, or confirmation, esteme the uniform iudgement of manie, ancient, godlie, and lerned Fathers writing vpon this place. We wil only recite their wordes, without other declaration for breuities sake.

S. Clemens Alexandrinus (li. 4. Strom. versus finem). writeth thus: Melchisedech king of Salem, Priest of God most high, gaue wine & bread santified nourishment in type of the Eucharist.

S. Cyprian (Epist. 63. ad Caecilium) Christ is Priest for euer according to the order of Melchisedech, which ordereth this coming from that sacrifice, and thence descending, that Melchisedech was Priest of God most high, that he offered bread & wine, that he blessed Abraham. For who is more a Priest of God most high, then our Lord Iesus Christ, who offered Sacrifice to God the Father, and offered the same, which Melchisedech had offered, bread and wine, to wit, his owne bodie and bloud. And a litle after: That therefore in Genesis, the blessing might be rightly celebrated, about Abraham, by Melchisedec the Priest, the image of Christs Sacrifice consisting in bread and wine went before, which thing our Lord perfecting and performing, offered bread and chalice mixt with wine, and he that is the plenitude, fulfilled the veritie of the prefigured image.

Eusebius Cesariensis (li 5. Demonst. Euang. c. 3.) Euen as he who was Priest of Nations was neuer sene to offer corporal sacrifices, but only bread & wine, when he blessed Abraham: so first our Lord & Sauiour him selfe, then priests that come from him, exercising the spiritual office of Priesthood in al nations, after the Ecclesiastical ordinances, do represent the mysteries of his bodie, and healthful bloud in bread & wine which mysteries Melchisedech knew so long before by diuine spirit, and vsed a representation of things to come.

S. Ambrose (li. 5. de Sacramen. c. 1.) We know the figure of the Sacraments went before, in Abrahams times, when Melchisedech offered Sacrifice.

Idem, in cap. 5. Heb. His eleuen oblations of cattle are vanished, which were in Aarons order, but Melchisedechs institution remayneth, which is celebrated al the world ouer in administration of the Sacraments.

S. Hierom. (Epist. ad Marcellam vt migret Bethleem.) Haue recourse to Genesis, and you shal find Melchisedech king of Salem, prince of this citie, who euen then in figure of Christ offered bread and wine, and dedicated the Christian mysterie in our Sauiours bodie and bloud. Idem Epist. ad Euagrium: Melchisedech offered not bloudie victims, but dedicated the Sacrament of Christ in bread and wine, simple and pure sacrifice. Idem. Quest. in Gen. c. 14: Our mysterie is signified in the word of order, not by Aaron in imolating brute victims, but in offering bread and wine, that is the bodie and bloud of our Lord Iesus. Idem in c. 26. Matth.: Melchisedech the Priest of God most high, by offering bread and wine, prefigured the Mysterie of the Eucharist.

S. Chrisostom (ho. 35. in Gen.) See the figure, thinke also I pray thee, of the veritie. ho. 36. After that Melchisedec king of Salem brought bread and wine (for he was Priest of God most high) Abraham receiued his oblations.

S. Augustin (Epist. 95.) Melchisedech bringing forth the sacrament (or mysterie) of our Lords table, knew how to figure his eternal priesthood. Idem li. 16. c. 22. ciuit. There first appeared that sacrifice, which is now offered to God by Christians in the whole world. Idem li. 17. c. 17. li. 18. c. 35. and
