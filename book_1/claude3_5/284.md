for benefites receiued: the other to procure fauour in anie good
enterprise, or desire. Al the which did prefigure and foreshewe one only Sacrifice
of Christes bodie and bloud, offered by him in two maners; bloudie on the
Crosse once for euer, wherof S. Paul expressly speaketh (Heb. 9) vnbloudie in
forme of bread and wine, wherof the same S. Paul speaketh (Heb. 11. v. 10.)
shewing that Christians *haue an Altar*, and consequently a Sacrifice sure ex-
celling those of the Tabernacle; and our Sauiour him selfe (*Math. 26. v. 25.*)
speaking of the consecration in the chalice, saidth: *This is my bloud of the new Testament*,
which he then instituted and dedicated, as is there noted. And the ancient
Fathers (by Caluins confession *in Heb. 9.*) generally vse this distinction of the
same Sacrifice offered in bloudie, & in vnbloudie maner. They likewise teach
that al lawful Sacrifices of the Law of nature, and of Moyses did end, and
were complete in this one, which is our daylie Sacrifice, our immaculate
lambe, our manna, our libament, our holocaust, our Sacrifice for sinne, our
Pacifique Sacrifice for al purposes, and in steede of al-old Sacrifices. So

9. *Sweete sauour.*] Not that the sauour of corporal things (though it were
sweeter then of burnt flesh and bones) delighteth Gods most pure substance:
but for that mans seruice in some good sorte performing his dutie, is very
acceptable to his diuine goodnes. For otherwise he required not these Sa-
crifices, nor other external Rites for him self, but he would haue his people
for their owne good to be exercised therein: especially for three causes.
First to kepe them from Idolatrie, wherto they were very prone, as appea-
reth by their often falling, notwithstanding continual admonitions to the
contrarie. For being as it were burdened with manie ceremonies, pertai-
ning to Gods true seruice, they might haue lesse mind, leysure, and occa-
sion to serue Idols. Secondly, for so much as man consisteth of soule and
bodie, as the soule must interiorly *worship God in spirit and veritie*; so the <sup>*Io. 4.*</sup>
bodie must also honour him exteriorly, *seruing iustice vnto sanctification*: that <sup>*Rom. 6.*</sup>
is by external good workes to increase iustice, and sanctitie, when by them the <sup>*v. 19.*</sup>
mind is instructed and inuited to know and honour God. For otherwise
saieth S. Dionyse (*c. 1. celest. Hierar.*) vnles mans vnderstanding vse the helpe
of corporal things, diuine veritie can not be attained. And S. Augustin (*lib.
10. c. 5 ciuit.*) teacheth that God commanded external Sacrifices, thereby
to lead his seruants vnto mortified spirites, contrite and humbled hartes, to
mercie and compassion towards others. In briefe (*c. 5. Euchir*) to the true and
perfect seruing of his Diuine power by faith, hope, and charitie. Thirdly, that
these external Sacrifices and Rites might prefigure and signifie greater, more
excellent, and more spiritual Mysteries of the new Testament. For as S. Paul
speaketh (*Heb. 10.*) *the Law* (of Moyses) *hauing a shadow of good things to come,
not the verie image of the things*, brought not to perfection: *nor roote away
sinnes by the bloud of oxen or goates*, but being (as is said) *a shadow*, rather shaded
then perfectly shewed the great benefites, which the new law as a perfect
image liuely representeth: especially Christes passion, which is the verie foun-
taine of grace and mercie. And wheras the old law could not iustifie (*Gal. 3.*) <sup>*Psal. 50.*</sup>
the law of Christ doth in dede iustifie, as the Gospel witnesseth, saying:
(*Ioan. 1 v. 17.*) *The law was geuen by Moyses, grace and veritie was made by
Iesus Christ*.
