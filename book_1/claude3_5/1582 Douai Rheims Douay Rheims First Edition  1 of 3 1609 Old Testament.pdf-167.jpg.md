GENESIS.

<aside>Protection & Invocation of Angels.</aside>

16. *The Angel that deliuereth me.* ] It is euident by this plaine text, that Iacob was deliuered from euiles by an Angel, and that he inuocated the same Angel to blesse his nephewes, S. Basil (li. 3. cont. Eunom. in initio) sheweth by this place among others, that an Angel is present with euerie one, as a pedagogue, and pastor, directing his life. S. Chrysostom also (ho. 7. in laud. S. Pauli) citeth this place in testimonie, that proper Angels are deputed to protect men. Yet Protestants say, that this Angel must be vnderstood of Christ: remitting their glose to the 31. ch. v. 13. and 32. v. 1 of Genesis, where it can not be proued. But the ancient Fathers teach the patronage & Inuocation of Angels grounded in holie Scripture. Namely in this place, and manie other places in the old Testament. Also Mat. 18. Act. 12. 1. Cor. 11. & the like. For example, S. Iustinus Martyr in explic. qq. receiued as a knowen truth, declareth that the Angels, which receiue the charge of guarding men, retaine the same office either to both soule and bodie, or to the soule after it is parted from the bodie. S. Cyril of Alexandria (lib. 4. cont. Iulian. prope init.) sheweth how God vseth the ministerie of holie Angels, for mens saluation, (saith) *He sendeth a noble diligent force* &c. These (Angels) driue away noysome wildebeasts from vs: and rescue those that are caught, from their crueltie: and teach what soeuer is laudable, to make our passage free, and not pestered, when with vs they glorifie one soueraigne God. S. Chrysostom (ho. 60. in Math. 18) S. Hierome vpon the same place. S. Ambrose, in Psal. 38. S. Augustin li. 83. qq. 79. & li. Soliloq. c. 27. S. Gregorie li. 4. c. 31. in 1 Iob. S. Bernard ser. 7. in Dedicat. Eccles. & ser. 12. in Psal. 90. S. others, (to omit profane writers) teach the same, that Caluin (li. Instit. c. 14. sect. 35.) dare not denie it, and yet wil needs doubt of it.

<aside>Proued by ancient Fathers.</aside>

16. *Be my name called vpon them.*] This place hath two good literal senses. For first it importeth, that Ephraim and Manasses were made participants among the Tribes, of the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Secondly that God would blesse them, for Abraham, Isaac, and Iacobs sake: so Moyses praying for the whole people (Exodi. 32.) besought God to remember, Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and God was therewith pacified.

CHAP. XLIX.

*Iacob replenished with the spirit of prophecie, a litle before his death, fortelleth his sonnes manie things, that shal happen to their posteritie. Chargeth some of them with faultes past, blesseth euerie one. 29. Appointeth where to burie him. 32. and dyeth.*

<sup>1</sup> AND Iacob called his sonnes, and said to them: Come together, that I <sup>2</sup> may shew you the things that shal come to you in the last dayes. † Come together, and heare you sonnes of Iacob, heare ye Israel your father:

<sup>3</sup> † Ruben my first begotten, thou art my strength, and the begining of my sorow: former in giftes, greater in <sup>4</sup> empire. † Thou art powred out as water, increase thou not: " because thou diddest ascend thy fathers bed, and diddest defile his couch.

[^1]: These are predictions not blessings. S. Amb. li. de Benedict. Patriar.

[^2]: A prophecie not an imprecation. Aug. li. 16. c. 12. cont. Faust.
