[^1]: Whether the band of marriage could be loosed or no in the old law, amongst Christians it can not be dissolved.

Preceptes and whether the lawful to the Iewes, which is also probable, for hat none of the holie Prophetes did euer reprehende it; sure it is, that Christ either by correcting a fault, or by recalling a former dispensation, restored the insolubilitie of mariage to the first institution, saying (*Mat. 19.*) *That which God hath ioyned together, let not man separate*. Further answering the Pharises, concerning this law : that *Moses for the hardnes of your hart permitted you to dismisse your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so*. And albeit he alloweth separation of man and wife for fornication, yet for no cause neither of them can marie againe, so long as the other liueth. As S. Augustin (*li. 1. de adulter. coniugijs. c. 11. & 12.*) by conference of three Euangelistes wordes touching this point, plainly sheweth, concluding that *so much as holie scripture calleth him* (that taketh a woman so dismissed) *not a husband, but an adulterer, she is stil his wife, by whom for fornication she was dimissed*. Likewise he proueth by S. Paules doctrin. (*Rom. 7. & 1. Cor. 7.*) that though diuorce be made for adultrie, yet neither the guiltie nor innocent partie can marie an other, for the Apostle saith : *A woman is vnder the law of her husband, so long as he liueth, if her husband be dead, she is loosed from his law. Therefore her husband liuing, she shal be called an aduoutresse, if she be with an other man. If she part let her remaine vnmaried, or be reconciled to her husband. A woman is bound to the law so long time, as her husband liueth*, &c. These wordes of the Apostle (sayeth he, *li. 1. c. 4.*) so often repeted, so often inculcated, are true, are liuelie, are sound, are plaine. A woman beginneth not to be the wife of a later husband, except she cease to be the wife of the former. And she ceaseth to be the wife of the former, if he die, not if he (or she) committe adultrie. Therefore a wife is lawfully dismissed for fornication, but the bond of the former remaineth; for which cause he is guiltie of adultrie, that marieth her that is dismissed, yea though it be for fornication. Thus and much more sayeth S. Augustin in the same, & in other bookes. And al the ancient fathers, and learned scholmen teach vniformly, that nothing but bodilie death can loose the band of Mariage consummate; nor of vnconsummate, but death, or solemne vow in an approued rule of religion.

*Punishment afflicted according to the fault, but so that he which is beaten haue not aboue fourtie stripes. 4. The oxes mouth not be mooseled that treadeth corne. 5. A maried man dying without issue, his brother must marie the widow. 11.
