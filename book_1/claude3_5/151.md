# GENESIS.

[^1]: To the same purpose he calleth them spies. After the maner of examiners calling suspected persons, as they may seme to be: therby to trie what they would answer. Al for their holsome penance, and withal to procure them afterwards more compassion among the Ægyptians. S. Aug. q. 139. super. Gen.

[^2]: By the health of Pharao.

[^3]: Into hel.

<aside>Disorderlie remission is hurtful.</aside>

<aside>Ioseph calleth his brothers spies for their good.</aside>

<aside>It is lawful to sweare by creatures.</aside>

<aside>In some case more conuenient then to name God expressly.</aside>

<aside>Diuers mansions in hel.</aside>

Ioseph in swearing by Pharaos health, hono­red God, the geuer and conseruer of health, life, power, dignitie and al that was in Pharao, wherby we see that this maner of swearing was lawful. As now likewise Christians lawfully sweare not only by God, but also by his creatures, saying: As God shal helpe them, & his holie Gospels: so it be with due circum­stances, and requisite conditions, namely with those which the Prophet Hie­remie mentioneth, *in truth, in iudgement, and in iustice*: not false, rash, nor of an vniust thing: nor in frequent and comon talke (a most bad custome) for so thou must neither sweare by God himself, nor (as our Sauiour teacheth) by heauen, nor by the earth, nor by Hierusalem, nor by thy head, nor anie other els: signifying that in some case, and due maner we may sweare by any of these. And in this particular Ioseph did rather name Pharao in his oath then God, as wel to conceale himself as yet from his brethren, as to strike more terrour in their hartes, by naming his master the King, in whom he had more interest then they.

For this phrase, of *bringing vnto hel, and descending into hel*, vsually spoken in the old Testament, of al sortes of soules both iust and wicked, signifieth that al went that time to hel, that is, to a lowe place, farre distant from heauen. But some to rest, and some to paine. Wherupon S. Hierom saith: Hel is a place, wherin soules are included, either in rest, or in paines, according to the qualitie of their desertes.

## CHAP. XLIII.

*The famine pressing, the land, Iacob willeth his sonnes to goe againe into Ægypt to bye more corne. 13. Who refusing to goe without Beniamin. 11. he is sent with them, and presents and duble money, lest the former were brought back by error. 16. Ioseph seing Beniamin, 23. deliuereth Simeon, and interteineth them al at dinner.*

<sup>1</sup> IN THE meane time the famine did oppresse al the land very sore. <sup>2</sup> And the prouision being spent, which they had brought out of Ægypt, Iacob said to his sonnes: Goe againe, and by vs a litle victual. <sup>3</sup> Iudas answered: That same man denounced vnto vs vnder attestation of an oath, saing: You shal not see my face, vnlesse you bring your
