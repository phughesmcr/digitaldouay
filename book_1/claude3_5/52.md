Obseruation of cleane and vn- Gen.7,2. cleane beastes for Sacrifice. Of peculiar places dedicated to religious vses where Gen. 4. people mette together to pray. Likwise diuers other things in the first age were 26. figures of Christes Sacraments: the Spirite of God getting powre to the waters, Gen. 1. (as Tertullian S. Hierom and others expound it) and the floud of Noe, by S. 1.Pet.3. Peters testimonie, were figures of Baptisme. Mariage instituted in Paradise, as the very paterne of holie Matrimonie, a Sacrament in the Church of Christ, where one man and one wife are onlie lawful, and not more at once in anie wise, Christ reforming that which in Moyses law was tolerated (for hardnes Mat. 19. of mens hartes, and for auoyding murther, to put away one wife, and take an other) to this first institution as it was in the beginning, two in one flesh, Ge.1,24 not three nor more.
