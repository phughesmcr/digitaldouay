children of God as S. Augustin noteth (q. 70. in Gen.) In like forte of the two sonnes of Isaac, onlie Iacob had the spiritual blessing, and enheritance therto belonging (Gen. 27.) Esau though prophane in maners selling his birthright (Gen. 25. v. 32.) which was a spiritual iurisdiction wherin he was a figure of the reprobate, yet it semeth he kept the true faith (Gen. 35. v. vlt.) But whether he did or no, sure it is, Iob, (who is probably thought to be of his race (Gen. 36.) was a most holie man and a rare example of vertue. But the posterities of them both, and al the progenies of Ismael, and of Abrahams other sonnes by Cetura, sooner or later fel to infidelitie and idolatrie. In other nations of the world, stil new goddes and goddesses were multiplied vpon euerie occasion, As S. Augustin (li. 18. de ciuit.) recounteth diuers. Al which notwithstanding, the true Church and citie of God continued most visible and notorious, yea with meruelous increase, especially after they were more hated and afflicted in Ægypt (Exo. 1.) whither they were brought by the strange and special prouidence of God, more strangely preserued, and most miraculously deliuered from thence.

Much more the Church of Christ (wherof this was a shadow, and figure) hath benne and shalbe euer most visible, from the first foundation therof to the worlds end. For besides the promises and predictions in the new Testament, al the Scriptures also of the old, which foretold Christ, do withal foreshew his Church. Totum quod annunciatur de Christo (saith S. Augustin de vnitate Eccles. c. 2.) <sup>†</sup> caput & corpus est. Al that is spoken of Christ is (of) the head and the bodie; The head is the onlie begotten Iesus Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God: he the Sauiour of the bodie. His bodie the Church. Againe (c. 4.) Totus Christus caput & corpus est. Whole Christ is the head and the bodie. The head, the onlie begotten Sonne of God, and the bodie his Church: the bridgrome and bride, two in one flesh. Yea for no other cause (saith he li. de catech. rud. c. 3.) were al those things written, before the coming of our Lord, which we read in holie Scriptures, but that his coming might be commended, and the future Church prefigured, that is, the people of God through out al nations, which is his bodie. The same doth S. Paul teach vs, not only saying (Gal. 3.) The law was our pedagogue (or conductor) to Christ, but also (1. Cor. 12.) that as the (natural) bodie is one and hath manie members, and al the members of the bodie, wheras they be manie, yet are one bodie; so also Christ. And (Coloss. 1.) that Christes bodie is the Church. As therfore the great blessing of redemption and saluation was promised in Christ (Gen. 12. &c.) so it was withal expressed, that al nations, and kindreds of the earth should be partakers therof, yea so innumerable as the dust of the earth, the starres of heauen, and sandes of the sea. Which S. Paule saith (Rom. 9.) is
