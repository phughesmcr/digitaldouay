forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the
Chananite, and Hethite, and Amorrheite, and Pherezeite,
and Heueite, and Iebuseite, to a Land that floweth with
18 milke & honie. <sup>†</sup> And they shal heare thy voice: and thou
shalt enter in, thou and the ancientes of Israel to the king
of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the
Hebrewes hath called vs: We wil goe three dayes iourney
into the wildernes, to sacrifice vnto the Lord our God.
19 <sup>†</sup> But I know that the king of Egypt wil not dismisse you
20 to goe but by mightie hand. <sup>†</sup> For I wil stretch forth my
hand, and wil strike Egypt in al my maruels, which I wil
doe in the middes of them: after these he wil dismisse you.
21 <sup>†</sup> And I wil geue grace to this people, in the sight of the
Egyptians: and when you shal goe forth, you shal not
22 depart emptie: <sup>†</sup> but ech woman shal aske of her neighbour and of her that is in house with her, vessels of siluer
and of gold, and rayment: and you shal lay it vpon your
sonnes and daughters, and shal spoyle Egypt.

ANNOTATIONS.
CHAP. III.

1. *Our Lord appeared.*] S. Steuen reciting this vision saieth, an Angel appeared to Moyses: and so it is in the Hebrew text, in the Chaldee Paraphrasis, and in the Septuagint Interpreters. Neither is the latin Edition (reading *Lord*) contrarie to the other which reade *Angel*, no more then one place of holie Scripture, is contrarie to an other in the same language, but very consonant in sense, (sometimes attributing the same apparitions and other workes to God, as the author and principal Agent, and sometimes to Angels, the next and immediate ministers of God. For so not only S. Steuen in the place alleaged, but also S. Paul saith plainly *Gal. 3.* that *the Law was deliuered by Angels*. And in made by his Epistle to the Hebrewes, proueth the excellence of Christs Law aboue gels, though the old law, by the difference of the persons, by whom both were geuen: affir- sometimes atming that the former *was spoken by Angels*, and *the declareth by our Lord Iesus tributed to Christ*. Wherof S. Cyril of Alexandria discourseth largely (li. 8. c. 1. Thesu.) God. shewing that in deede God deliuered the Law, yet not by their owne autho- Proued by ritie, but as seruants and legates of God. And before him S. Dionysie of Ario- holie Scrippagite (li. celest. Hierar. c. 4.) taught the very same, *the Law* (sayth he) *as tures and Faour most true word, was geuen by Angels*: yea al apparitions, made to the an- thers. cient fathers before the law, and after it, were made by Angels. A litle after obseruing to himselfe, that diuine Scriptures also testifie, that the law was geuen and granted to Moyses by God, to teach vs that in deede it hath the forme of sacred and diuine law, and receiueth, *eam angelorum aut sacra opera prouisam*, that it came to vs [from God] by the meanes of Angels. In like maner S. Iustinus Martyr
