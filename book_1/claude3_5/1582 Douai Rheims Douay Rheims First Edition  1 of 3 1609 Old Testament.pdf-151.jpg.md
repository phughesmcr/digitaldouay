GENESIS. 131

<aside>Disorderlie remission is hurtful.</aside>

9. *You are spies*] To the same purpose he calleth them spies. After the maner of examiners calling suspected persons, as they may seme to be: therby to trie what they would answer. Al for their belsome penance, and withal to procure them afterwards more compassion among the Ægyptians. S. Aug. q. 139. super. Gen.

<aside>Ioseph calleth his brothers spies for their good.</aside>

15. *By the health of Pharao.* Ioseph in swearing by Pharaos health, honored God, the geuer and conseruer of health, life, power, dignitie and al that was in Pharao, wherby we see that maner of swearing was lawful. As now likewise Christians lawfully sweare not only by God, but also by his creatures, saying: As God shal helpe them, & his holie Gospels: so it be with due circumstances, and requisite conditions, namely with those which the Prophet Hie-

<aside>It is lawful to sweare by creatures.</aside>

[^1]remie mentioneth, *in truth, in iudgement, and in iustice*: not false, rash, nor of an vniust thing: not in frequent and comon talke (a most bad custome) for so

[^2]thou shalt neither sweare by God himself, nor (as our sauiour teacheth) by heauen, nor by the earth, nor by Hierusalem, nor by thy head, nor anie thing els: signifying that in some case, and due maner we may sweare by any of these. And in this particular Ioseph did rather name Pharao in his oath then God, as wel to conceale himself as yet from his brethren, as to strike more terrour in their hartes, by naming his master the King, in whom he had more interest then they.

<aside>In some case more conuenient then to name God expressly.</aside>

38. *Vnto hel.*] To that place where soules remaine, as before. chap. 37.

[^3]For this phrase, *of bringing vnto hel, and descending vnto hel*, vsually found in the old Testament, of al sortes of soules both iust and wicked, signifieth that al went that time to hel, that is, to a lowe place, farre distant from heauen. But some to rest, and some to paine. Wherupon S. Hierom saith: Hel is a place, wherin soules are included, either in rest, or in paines, according to the qualitie of their desertes.

CHAP. XLIII.

*The famine pressing the land, Iacob willeth his sonnes to goe againe into Ægypt to bye more corne*: 3. *Who refusing to goe without Beniamin*, 11. *he is sent with them, and present and duble money, lest the former were brought back by error*. 16. *Ioseph seing Beniamin*, 23. *deliuereth Simon, and interteineth them al at dinner*.

<sup>1</sup>IN THE meane time the famine did oppresse al the land
<sup>2</sup>very sore. And the prouision being spent, which they had brought out of Ægypt, Iacob said to his sonnes: Goe
<sup>3</sup>againe, and by vs a litle victual. Iudas answered: That same man denounced vnto vs vnder attestation of an oath, saying: You shal not see my face, vnlesse you bring your youngest
