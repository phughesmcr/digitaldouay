# PROEMIAL ANNOTATIONS.

containing manifest errors, or faults by Heretikes. Neither can a Christian [^1]
Catholique be otherwise assured, which Bookes are Divine and Canonical
Scriptures, but by declaration of the Catholique Church, which without interruption succedeth the Apostles, to whom our Saviour promised, and sent
the Holie Ghost, to teach al truth. For if in anie thing more then others,
specially one chief and most necessarie point is, to know and declare, which
Bookes are Gods holie Word: being of most singular importance.

# THE SUMME OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, as it is distinguished from the new.

Notwithstanding the subject, & general argument of both Testaments
is one & the same in substance, as is already said, yet they differ in
time, in maner of vttering of Mysteries, in varietie of precepts, & promises,
also in meanes to obserue the thinges enacted, & to attayne the end proposed. In regard wherof S. Ierome saith: Lex Moysi & omne vetus
instrumentum elementis mundi intelliguntur, quibus quasi elementis & Religionis exordijs Deum discimus. The law of Moyses and al the old Testament are vnderstood the elements of the
world, by which, as by first rudiments & beginnings, we lerne
to know God. For that in it we haue first the Law of nature: and afterwards the written, with promises of temporal rewardes as long life,
land flowing with milke & honie, & the like; but it brought nothing
to perfection, as S. Paul saith, when giftes & hostes were offered,
which could not according to conscience, make the obseruer
perfect. For the helpes of that time, were but infirma & egena elemÄ“ta:
weake & poore elements. Likewise in regard, touching the punishments that sometimes happened to the people of the old Testament, when they
transgressed, the same Apostle affirmeth, that al the same chanced to
them in figure, & are written for our correction, vpon whom
the endes of the world are come. So that the old Testament, or Law was
but our pedagogue in Christ. For it serued (saith he) the whole course
of Gods Church, for the space of foure thousand yeares, that is, from the beginning of the world vntil Christ our Redemer. which Diuines diuide into sixe
ages, wherin was varietie & change of her state, three vnder the Law of
nature, and three others vnder the written Law. The seuenth & last age
being this time of grace (wherin we now are) from Christ, to the day of general iudgement: as the world was made in six dayes, and in the seuenth
God is said to haue rested, and therfore sanctified it, in other sort, then the
former six. The eight wil be after the Resurrection, during for al eternitie.
Which six ages of the ancient Church, & old Testament, are thus distinguished. The first from the Creation to Noes floud, conteyning the space of 1656.

[^1]: The Holie Scriptures are discerned by the Church which hath the Holie Ghost to teach al Divine Scriptures.
