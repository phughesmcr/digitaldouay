LEVITICUS.

Our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: <sup>1</sup>Speake to al the assemblie of the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Be ye holie, because I the Lord your God am holie. <sup>2</sup>Let euerie one feare his father, and mother. Keepe my Sabbathes. I the Lord your God. <sup>3</sup>Turne not your selues to idols, neither make you to your selues molten goddes. I the Lord your God. <sup>4</sup>If ye immolate an hoste of pacifiques to the Lord, that it may be placable, <sup>5</sup>that day wherin it is immolated, shal you eate it, and the next day: and whatsoeuer shal be left vntil the third day, you shal burne with fire. <sup>6</sup>if after two daies anie man eate therof, he shal be profane, and guiltie of impietie: <sup>7</sup>and shal beare his iniquitie, because he hath polluted the holie of the Lord, and that soule shal perish out of his people. <sup>8</sup>And when thou reapest the corne of thy lande, thou shalt not sheare the face of the earth to the verie ground: neither shalt thou gather the eares that remaine. <sup>9</sup>Neither in thy vineyard shalt thou gather the clusters, and grapes that fal downe, but shalt leaue them to the poore, and the strangers to take. I the Lord your God. <sup>10</sup>You shal not committe theft.

I the Lord. <sup>12</sup>Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbour, nor oppresse him by violence. The worke of thy hireling shal not abide with thee vntil morning. <sup>13</sup>Thou shalt not speake euil of the deafe man, nor put a stumbling blocke before the blinde: but thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, because I am the Lord. <sup>14</sup>Thou shalt not doe that which is vniust, nor iudge vniustly. Consider not the person of a poore man, neither honour thou the countenance of him that is mightie. Iudge iustly to thy neighbour. <sup>15</sup>Thou shalt not be a criminatour, nor a whisperer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the bloud of thy neighbour. I the Lord. <sup>16</sup>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy hart, but controule him openly, lest thou incurre sinne through him. <sup>17</sup>Seeke not reuenge, nor be mindeful of the iniurie of thy citizens. Thou shalt loue thy freind as thy self. I the Lord. <sup>18</sup>Keepe ye my lawes. Thou shalt not make thy cattel to gender with the beasts of an other kinde. Thy field thou shalt not sowe with diuers seede. A garment, that is wouen of two sortes, thou shalt not put on. <sup>19</sup>If a man lie with a woman by carnal co-
