GENESIS.

scene, he supposed her to be an harlot: for she had couered
her face, lest she should be knowen. <sup>16</sup>And going vnto
her, he said: Suffer me to lye with thee: for he knew her
not to be his daughter in law. Who answering: What wilt
thou geue me that thou maiest enioy my companie? <sup>17</sup>He
said: I wil send thee a kid out of the flockes. And when she
said againe: I wil suffer that thou wilt, if thou geue me a
pledge, til thou send that which thou doest promise;
<sup>18</sup>Iudas said: What wilt thou to be geuen thee for a pledge?
She answered: Thy ring, and bracelet, and staffe which
thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore by once
companying conceaued, <sup>19</sup>and rising she went her way: and
putting of the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood. <sup>20</sup>And Iudas sent a kid by his
shephard the Odollamite, that he might receiue the pledge
againe, which he had geuen to the woman: who when he
had not found her, <sup>21</sup>he asked the men of that place: Where
is the woman that sate in the crosse way? Al making answere:
There was no harlot in this place. <sup>22</sup>He returned to Iudas,
and said to him: I haue not found her: yea the men also
of that place said vnto me, that there neuer sate harlot there.
<sup>23</sup>Iudas said: Let her take it to her, surely she can not charge
vs with a lye, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou
didst not find her. <sup>24</sup>And behold after three moneths they
told Iudas, saying: Thamar thy daughter in law hath played
the harlot, and her bellie semeth to swel. And Iudas said:
Bring her forth :: that she may be burnt. <sup>25</sup>Who when she
was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying:
By the man whose these things are, haue I conceaued:
looke whose the ring is, and the bracelet, and the staffe.
<sup>26</sup>Who acknowledging the giftes, said: She is iuster then I:
because I did not geue her to Sela my sonne. But he knew her
no more. <sup>27</sup>And when she was readie to be brought to bed,
there appeared twinnes in her bellie: and in the verie deliuerie of the infants, one put forth the hand, wherin the
midwife tyed a skarlet string, saying: <sup>28</sup>This shal come
forth the former. <sup>29</sup>But he drawing backe his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition
diuided for thee? and for this cause called his name Phares.
<sup>30</sup>Afterward his brother came forth, in whose hand was the
skarlet string: whom she called Zara.
