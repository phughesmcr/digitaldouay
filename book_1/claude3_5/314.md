duly celebrated, he shal offer the calfe, and praying for him
self and for his house, he shal immolate it: <sup>12</sup> and taking the
thurible, which he hath filled of the burning coales of the
altar, and taking vp with his hand of the compounded per-
fume for incense, he shal goe in beyond the veile into the
Holie place: <sup>13</sup> that when the incense is put vpon the fire,
the cloude therof and the vapour may couer the oracle,
which is ouer the testimonie, and he die not. <sup>14</sup> He shal take
also of the bloud of the calfe, and sprinckle with his finger se-
uen times against the propitiatorie to the east. <sup>15</sup> And when
he hath killed the bucke goate for the sinne of the people,
he shal carie in the bloud therof within the veile, as hath
bene commanded of the bloud of the calfe, that he may
sprinckle it against the oracle, <sup>16</sup> and expiate the San-
ctuarie from the vncleannesse of the children of Israel, and
from their preuarications, and al their sinnes. According to
this rite shal he doe to the tabernacle of testimonie, which is
fixed among them in the middest of the filth of their habita-
tion. <sup>17</sup> Let no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest
goeth into the Sanctuarie, to pray for him self and for his
house, & for the whole assemblie of Israel, vntil he come

the calfe, and of the bucke goate, let him poure it vpon the
hornes therof round about: <sup>19</sup> and sprinkling with his fin-
ger seuen times, let him expiate, and sanctifie it from the vn-
cleannesse of the children of Israel. <sup>20</sup> After he hath clensed
the Sanctuarie, and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him
offer the liue goate: <sup>21</sup> and putting both handes vpon his
head, let him confesse al the iniquities of the children of Is-
rael, and al their offences and sinnes: which praying to light
on his head, he shal send him forth by a man ready therto,
into the desert. <sup>22</sup> And when the goat hath caried al their
iniquities into the solitarie ground, and shal be let goe into
the desert, <sup>23</sup> Aaron shal returne into the tabernacle of testi-
monie, and putting of the vestiments, which he had on him
before when he entred into the Sanctuarie, and leauing them
there, <sup>24</sup> he shal wash his flesh in a holie place, and shal be
clothed with his owne garments. And after that he hath gone
forth and offered his owne holocaust, and the peoples, he
shal pray as wel for him self, as for the people: <sup>25</sup> and the
