to Jacob after he returned from Mesopotamia of Siria, and
<sup>10</sup> he blessed him, saying: Thou shalt not be called any more
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called him
<sup>11</sup> Israel, and said to him: I am God almightie, increase thou
and multiplie: Of thee shal be nations and peoples of nations, kinges shal come forth of thy loynes. <sup>12</sup> And the land
which I gaue to Abraham and Isaac, I wil geue to thee, and
<sup>13</sup> to thy seede after thee. <sup>14</sup> And he departed from him.
<sup>14</sup> But he erected a title of stone, in the place where God had
spoken vnto him: offering vpon it liquide offeringes, and
<sup>15</sup> powring oile on it: <sup>15</sup> and calling the name of that place,
<sup>16</sup> Bethel. <sup>16</sup> And being gone forth from thence, he came in
the spring time to the land which leadeth to Ephrata:
<sup>17</sup> wherin when Rachel was in trauaile, because of difficultie in her trauaile, she beganne to be in danger, and the
midwife said vnto her: Feare not, for thou shalt haue also
<sup>18</sup> this a sonne. <sup>18</sup> And her soule departing for paine, and death
now at hand, she called the name of her sonne Benoni, that
is the sonne of my paine: but his father called him Beniamin,
<sup>19</sup> that is the sonne of the right hand. <sup>19</sup> Rachel therfore died,
and was buried in the hye way that leadeth to Ephrata, this
<sup>20</sup> is Bethlehem. <sup>20</sup> And Jacob erected a title ouer her sepulchre: This is the title of Rachels monument, vntil this
<sup>21</sup> present day. <sup>21</sup> Departing thence, he pitched his tent
<sup>22</sup> beyond the Flocke tower. <sup>22</sup> And when he dwelt in that
countrie: Ruben went, and slept with Bala his fathers concubine: which thing he was not ignorant of. And the sonnes
<sup>23</sup> of Jacob were twelue. <sup>23</sup> The sonnes of Lia: Ruben the
first begotten, and Simeon, and Leui, and Iudas, and Issachar,
<sup>24</sup> and Zabulon. <sup>24</sup> The sonnes of Rachel: Ioseph and Ben<sup>25</sup> iamin. <sup>25</sup> The sonnes of Bala Rachels handmaid: Dan and
<sup>26</sup> Nepthali. <sup>26</sup> The sonnes of Zelpha Lias handmaid: Gad and
Aser: these are the sonnes of Iacob, that were borne to him
<sup>27</sup> in Mesopotamia of Siria. <sup>27</sup> He came also to Isaac his father
in Mambre, the citie of Arbee, this is Hebron: wherin
<sup>28</sup> Abraham and Isaac soiourned. <sup>28</sup> And the dayes of Isaac
<sup>29</sup> were complete an hundred eyghtie yeares. <sup>29</sup> And spent
with age he died, and was put to his people, being old and
ful of dayes: and Esau and Iacob his sonnes buryed him.
