# Genesis

[^1]: B v. 6. 35. ciuit. 2. Reg. 8. Psal. 59.

<aside>It not exclude the meanes by which his wil is done.</aside>

see that Gods forseing, predestinating, and promising exclude not, but in dede include secondarie causes, and ordinarie meanes, by which his eternal wil and pleasure is fulfilled. For as God did forsee that Rebecca should haue children, so he did forsee, that Isaac should pray for it, and she obtayne it; and the one was as sure to come to passe as the other. And the same consequence is true concerning eternal life as S. Gregorie teacheth. li. 1. c. 8. Dialog.

<aside>The couenant made to Abraham pertaned only to Isaac and Iacob, not to the rest of his issue.</aside>

21\. *The elder shal serue the younger*] As before (c. 17. v. 21. & c. 21. v. 12.) the couenant and great promises made to Abrahams sede, are declared to pertaine only to Isaac, and not to Ismael, nor to the other brothers: so the same belong not to Esau, the elder, but only to Iacob the younger sonne of Isaac, the Holie Ghost saying, *The elder shal serue the younger*. And withal signifieth, (saith S. Augustin) that the elder people of the Iewes shal serue the younger Christian people. For although it may be vnderstood literally to be fulfilled, in that the Idumeans coming of Esau, were subdued by King Dauid coming of Iacob; yet it is more conueniently beleeued, that this prophecie tended to a greater thing. And what is this, but that which is euidently fulfilled in the Iewes and Christians?

Another great document of grace S. Paul geathereth vpon this Mysterie: that the twinnes being not yet borne, nor hauing done any thing good or euil, without anie good merites, the younger is elected, the elder reprobate. For doubtles (saith S. Augustin) touching original sinne they were both equal, and concerning proper sinne, neither of them had anie at al. By which example he sheweth Gods mere mercie in the elect, and iustice in the reprobate. as is more largely noted in the English New Testament, vpon the ninth chapter to the Romanes.

<aside>Gods mere mercie in electing his iustice to the reprobate.</aside>

<aside>Iacob lawfully bought but Esau sinned in selling the first-birth-right.</aside>

31\. *Sel me thy first birth right*] Iacob instructed by his mother, that God had chosen him in place of his brother Esau (for to her God had reueled that the elder should serue the younger) did lawfully vse this oportunitie to get Esaus grant of the right pertaining to the first borne, but Esau in selling it sinned, shewing himselfe an intemperate prophane man. Heb. 12.

# Chap. XXVI.

*Isaac by reason of famine goeth into Gerara, 3. where God reneweth to him the promises made to Abraham. 9. King Abimelech blameth him for calling his wife his sister. 15. the people enuying his wealth, quareleth for his welles 26. At last Abimelech maketh league with Isaac.*

<aside>God by Abrahams examplar life inuited the Egyptians to true religion: now commandeth Isaac to stay in Gerara to the like end. S. Theod. q. 76. in Gen.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> And when a famine was risen in the land, after that sterilitie, that had chanced in the dayes of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestines into Gerara. <sup>2</sup> And our Lord appeared to him, and said: Goe not downe into Egypt, but rest in the land which I shal tel thee. <sup>3</sup> And seiourne in it, and I wil be with thee, and wil blesse thee: for to thee and to thy seed, I wil geue al these countries, accom-plishing the oath which I sware to Abraham thy father. <sup>4</sup> And
