In the third moneth of the departure of Israel out of the Land of Egypt, "this day they came into " the wildernesse of Sinai, <sup>2</sup> For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, and there Israel pitched their tentes ouer against the mountaine. <sup>3</sup> And Moyses went vp to God: and our Lord called him from the mountaine, and said: " This shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and shalt tel the children of Israel: <sup>4</sup> Your selues haue sene what I haue done to the Egyptians, how I haue carried you vpon the winges of eagles, and haue taken you vnto me. <sup>5</sup> If therfore you wil heare my voice, and keepe my couenant, you shal be "my peculiar of al peoples: for al the earth is myne. <sup>6</sup> And you shal be vnto me " a priestly kingdome, and " a holie nation: these are the wordes that thou shalt speake to the children of Israel. <sup>7</sup> Moyses came: and calling together the natious of the people, he declared al the wordes which our Lord had commanded him. <sup>8</sup> And al the people answered together: Al thinges that our Lord hath spoken, we wil doe. And when Moyses had reported the peoples wordes to our Lord, <sup>9</sup> our Lord said to him: Now presently wil I come to thee in the darkenesse of a cloude, that the people may heare me speaking to thee, and may beleue thee for euer. Moyses therfore " told the peoples wordes to our Lord. <sup>10</sup> Who said to him: Goe to the people, and sanctifie them to day, and to morow, and let them wash their garmentes. <sup>11</sup> And let them be readie against the third day: for in the third day the Lord wil descend in the sight of al the people vpon the mount Sinai. <sup>12</sup> And thou shalt appoynt certaine limites to the people in circuite, and shalt say to them: Beware ye ascend not into the mount, and that you touch not the endes therof: euerie one that toucheth the mount, dying shal dye. <sup>13</sup> Handes shal not touch him, but he shal be stoned to death, or shal be shot through with arrowes: whether it be beast, or man, it shal not liue. When the trumpet shal beginne to sound, then let them ascend into the mount. <sup>14</sup> And Moyses came downe from the mount to the people, and sanctified them. And when they had washed their garmentes, <sup>15</sup> he said to them: Be readie against the third day, and come not neere your wiues. <sup>16</sup> And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders beganne to be heard,

<aside>To this place (which was their 12. mansion) they came the 47. day after they parted from Egypt. And the third day folowing which was the 50, the law was geuen in mount Sinay.</aside>

<aside>God would haue their free consent, els it were not a perfect couenant Theodoret. q 35. in Exod.</aside>

<aside>In this couenant God promiseth particular loue: Priestly function, whereby they might better serue him; and effectual grace and sanctitie.</aside>

<aside>The people promise loyaltie to God, and to keepe his commandements.</aside>

<aside>So Angels & Saincts offer our prayers & other good workes to God, though he know al things before hand.</aside>
