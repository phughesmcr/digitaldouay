<sup>40</sup> their fathers, and their owne they shal be afflicted: vntil they confesse their owne and their auncetours iniquities, whereby they haue preuaricated against me, and walked contrarie vnto me. <sup>41</sup> I also therefore wil walke against them, and bring them into their enemies land, vntil their vncircumcised mind be ashamed: then shal they pray for their impieties. <sup>42</sup> And I wil remember my couenant, that I made with Iacob, and Isaac, and Abraham. Of the land also I wil be mindful: <sup>43</sup> which when it shal be left of them, shal take pleasure in her sabbathes, being desolate for them. But they shal pray for their sinnes, for that they reiected my iudgementes, and dispised my lawes. <sup>44</sup> Howbeit euen when they were in the land of their enemies, I did not cast them of altogether, neither did I so dispise them, that they should be consumed, and I should make my couenant with them frustrate. For I am the Lord their God, <sup>45</sup> and I wil remember mine old couenant, when I brought them out of the Land of Ã†gypt, in the sight of the Gentiles, for to be their God I the Lord. These are the iudgementes, and preceptes, and lawes, which our Lord gaue between him self and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by the hand of Moyses.
