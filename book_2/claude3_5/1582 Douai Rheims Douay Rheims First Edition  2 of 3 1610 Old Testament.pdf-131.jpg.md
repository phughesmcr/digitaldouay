OF PSALMES. 131

<sup>20</sup> How great tribulations hast thou shewed me, manie and euil: and turning thou hast quickened me: and from the depthes of the earth thou hast brought me backe againe.

<aside>After tribulations recreated me.</aside>

<sup>21</sup> Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence: and being turned thou hast comforted me.

<sup>22</sup> For I also wil confesse to thee in the instruments of Psalme thy truth: Ã´ God I wil sing to thee on the harpe, holie one of Israel.

<sup>23</sup> My p lippes shal reioyce when I shal sing to thee; and my soule, which thou hast redemed.

<aside>I wil prayse thee with mouth and hart.</aside>

<sup>24</sup> Yea and my tongue al the day shal meditate thy iustice: when they shal be confounded and ashamed that seeke euils to me.
