<sup>6</sup> Who turneth the sea into drie land, in the riuer they shal passe on foote, there we shal reioyce in him.

[^1] The read sea, when Iosue brought the people ouer Iordan, in remembring and reciting these singular benefites.

<sup>7</sup> Who ruleth in his strength for euer his eyes looke vpon the gentiles: they that exasperate him let them not be exalted in themselues.

[^2] Gods chosen people the Iewes did often exasperate God by their ingratitude, murmuring, and other sinnes: whom the prophet therfore admonisheth, not to be proud, lest they be subdued, and brought lowe.

<sup>8</sup> Ye Gentiles blesse our God: and make the voice of his prayse hearde.

[^3] By way of inuocation the Psalmist prophecieth the conuersion of Gentiles.

<sup>9</sup> Who hath put my soule in life: and hath not geuen my feete to be moued.

[^4] The voice of the whole Church: confessing Gods prouidence and protection, that he neuer faileth, for the Iewes failing from Christ the Gentiles beleued in him; and some nations, or countries falling from Religion, others are conuerted.

<sup>10</sup> Because thou hast proued vs o God: by fire thou hast tried vs, as siluer is tried.

[^5] God suffereth his Church to be persecuted with al kindes of tribulation, as some are here recited.

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast brought vs into a snare, thou hast laide tribulations on our backe: thou hast set men vpon our heades.

<sup>12</sup> We haue passed through fire and water: and thou hast brought vs out into refreshing.

[^6] But through Gods assistance his seruants passe through, and ouercome al tentations.

<sup>13</sup> I wil goe into thy house with holocaustes: I wil render thee my vowes: <sup>14</sup> which my lippes haue distinguished. And my mouth hath spoken in my tribulation.

[^7] Sacrifice of thankes, and voluntarie vowes, that which anie promiseth to God in tribulation, they must performe accordingly.

<sup>15</sup> Holocaustes with marrow wil I offer to thee, with incense of rammes: I wil offer to thee oxen with bucke goates.

[^8] These were the best external sacrifices of the old law.

<sup>16</sup> Come ye, heare, and I wil tel ye that feare God, what great things he hath done for my soule.

[^9] But both then and now the internal sacrifices of contrite hart, of iustice, and of diuine praise best please God.

<sup>17</sup> To him haue I cried with my mouth, and haue exulted vnder my tongue.

[^10] From the hart which is vnder the tongue, and directeth the tongue what to speake.

<sup>18</sup> If I haue beheld iniquitie in my hart, our Lord wil not heare.

[^11] Whosoeuer wil be heard in prayer, must repent of his sinnes.
