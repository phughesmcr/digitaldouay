<sup>4</sup> They were not hid from their children, in an other generation.

Telling the prayses of our Lord, and his powers, and his meruelous workes which he hath done.

<sup>5</sup> And he *g* raised vp a testimonie in Jacob: and *h* made a law in Israel.

<aside>g God of his mercie without precedent merite, raised vp a peculiar people of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, h and gaue them a particular law, first of Circumcision, & more largely by Moyses.</aside>

How great thinges he commanded our fathers, to make <sup>6</sup> the same knowne to their children : that *k* an other generation may know.

<aside>i Abraham instructed his children and his house after him, Gen. 18. & in like sorte others taught their children.</aside>

The children that shal be borne, and shal rise vp, and shal tel their children.

<sup>7</sup> That they may *l* put their hope in God, and may *m* not forget the workes of God : and may *n* seeke after his commandmentes.

<aside>l For three causes God gaue his law, that his people may haue confidence in him, he shewing his care to instruct and gouerne them; m that they remember his benefites; n and kepe his commandmentes.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> That they become not as their fathers : *o* a peruerse generation and exasperating.

<aside>o The Iewish nation very often, and in great numbers murmured, rebelled, and committed other great sinnes, and therefore Dauid exhorted the people of his time, not to do the like. And this exhortation perteyned more especially to Christians, as S. Paul teacheth, 1. Cor. 10.</aside>

A generation, that hath not directed their hart, their spirit hath not bene faithful towards God.

<sup>9</sup> The *p* children of Ephrem bending, and shooting with bow : were turned in the day of battel.

[^1]

<sup>10</sup> They kept not the testament of God : and in his law they would not walke.

<sup>11</sup> And they forgate his benefites, and his meruelous workes, which he shewed them.

<sup>12</sup> Before their fathers he did meruelous thinges in the land of Egypt, in the filde *q* of Tanis.

<aside>b Tanis the principal citie in Egypt nere the riuer Nilus, where Moyses wrought his great miracles.</aside>

<sup>13</sup> He diuided the sea & brought them through : and he made the waters to stand as in a bottle.

And

[^1]: They first (trusting in their owne strength) without Gods commandment (Num. 14.) went forth to battel: and were ouerthrowne. 1. Par 7. v. 21.
