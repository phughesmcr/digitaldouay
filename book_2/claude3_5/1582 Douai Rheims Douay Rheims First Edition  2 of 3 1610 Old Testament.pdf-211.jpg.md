OF PSALMES 211

<aside>I said in mine excesse: Euerie man is a lyer.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> What shall I render to our Lord, for al thinges that he hath rendred to me?

<aside>Considering that God hath not only geuen, and bestowed manie great benefites vpon me, and al mankind, but also hath rendred good for euil, mercie for our sinnes, we hauing rendered euil for good: what now shal I render, (sayth a true penitent,) for al that he hath thus rendred to me, deseruing so euil?</aside>

<sup>4</sup> I wil take the chalice of saluation: and I wil inuocat the name of our Lord.

<aside>Seing I am not able to render anie thing worthie of Gods fauoure to me, yet I wil do that I can: I wil gratefully accept his great benefite, the cuppe of Christs passion, which he drunke for mankind, and wil praise, and cal vpon his name.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> I wil render my vowes to our Lord before al his people: <sup>6</sup> precious in the sight of our Lord is the death of his Sainctes.

<aside>I wil pay voluntarie vowes, for Gods glorie, and edification of others. I yea I wil offer my life, and suffer death, when Gods glorie shal require it, in whose sight, the death of Sainctes is precious, and most highly esteemed.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> O Lord because I am thy seruant: I am thy seruant, and the sonne of thy handmaide.

<aside>Alwayes vnderstood, that such as suffer persecution, be in good state of their soules, the true seruantes of God, the children of the Church his handmaide.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast broken my bondes: <sup>9</sup> I wil sacrifice to thee the host of praise, and I wil inuocate the name of our Lord.[^1]

<sup>10</sup> I wil render my vowes to our Lord in the sight of al his people: in the courtes of the house of our Lord, in the middes of thee Ã´ Ierusalem.[^2]
