THE BOOKE

<sup>6</sup>Upon thee have I bene confirmed from the wombe: from my mothers bellie thou art my protector.

<sup>7</sup>In thee is my singing alwaies: I was made to manie as a wonder: and thou art a strong helper.

[^1]<sup>8</sup>Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glorie al the day thy greatnes.

[^2]<sup>9</sup>Reject me not in the time of olde age: when my strength shal faile, forsake me not.

[^3]<sup>10</sup>Because mine enimies have said to me: and they that watched my soule, consulted together,

<sup>11</sup>Saying: God hath forsaken him, pursue, and take him: because there is none to deliuer.

<sup>12</sup>O God be not farre from me: my God have respect to mine ayde.

<sup>13</sup>Let them be confounded, and fayle that detract from my soule: let them be covered with confusion, and shame, that seeke euils to me.

<sup>14</sup>But I wil alwaies hope: and wil adde vpon al thy praise.

[^4]<sup>15</sup>My mouth shal shew forth thy iustice: al the day thy saluation. Because I have not knowne lerning, <sup>16</sup>I wil enter into the powres of our Lord: O Lord I wil be mindful of thy iustice onely.

[^5]<sup>17</sup>O God thou hast taught me from my youth: and vntil now I wil pronounce thy meruelous workes.

<sup>18</sup>And vnto ancient age, and olde age: ô God forsake me not? Vntil I shew forth thy arme to al the generation, that is to come.

<sup>19</sup>Thy might, and thy iustice ô God euen to the highest, great mervailes which thou hast done: ô God who may be like to thee?

[^1]: It semeth strange to most men, why the iust haue more trubles then the wicked.

[^2]: A necessarie prayer for perseuerance, which none can haue without special and continual helpe of grace.

[^3]: Against this special danger, and last assaultes of the enimie, Christ hath instituted the Sacrament of Extreme Vnction.

[^4]: The best meanes to conserue vertue, is to exercise the same, adding good workes towards our neighbours, and praises to God.

[^5]: I professe not exact knowlege of natural thinges; but I consider and contemplate the infinite powre of God, which appeareth in his workes, and his iust iudgements, as partly haue appeared in punishing, and rewarding some in this life, but especially wil be manifest in the end of this world.
