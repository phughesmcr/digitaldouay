OF PSALMES
PSALME CXXXII.

*Fraternal concord is commended to al in the Church, as necessarie and delectable in it self, and blessed of God.*

<aside>Fraternal concord. the 7. key.</aside>

A gradual Canticle *of Dauid*.

<aside>Dauid being a most peaceable man, euen toward his enemies, is added by Esdras in this title, as an example for others to imitate.</aside>

**B**EHOLD how good, and how pleasant a thing it is, for brethren to dwel in one:

<aside>That concord is both good and pleasant, nedeth no other proofe, but only to consider, & to behold the fruict therof in euerie communitie, and specially in the Church of God.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> As oyntement on the head, which ranne downe vpon the beard, the beard of Aaron, which ranne downe vnto the skimme of his garment:

[^1]

<sup>3</sup> As the dew of Hermon, which runneth downe vpon mount Sion.

[^2]

Because there hath our Lord commanded blessing, and life euen for euer.

[^3]

PSALME CXXXIII.

*Al, and specially clergie men that serue the Church, are inuited to prayse God by day and by night, that they may be blessed of God.*

<aside>God continually to be praised. the 1. key.</aside>

A gradual Canticle.

**L**O now blesse our Lord, al ye the seruantes of our Lord:

Which stand in the house of our Lord, in the courtes of the house of our God.

<sup>2</sup> In the nightes lift vp your handes vnto the holie places, and blesse ye our Lord.

<sup>3</sup> Our Lord out of Sion blesse thee, who made heauen and earth.

[^4]

[^1]: The ointment, wherewith Aaron, and other High Priestes were consecrated, was precious, and most odoriferous, signifying grace bought by Christes blood, and producing vertues, which make sweete sauoure: it was powred vpon the High Priestes head, who being head of the Church, vnited and concord descended from him to other Priestes, and so to the people, euen to the lowest, and meanest of the Church.

[^2]: An other similitude to declare the excellence of concord: As the dew of mount Hermon, which is perpetually couered with snow, that falleth from the heauen, thence descending refresheth & fructifieth the hil of Sion: so mutual concord, and fraternal charitie amongst the faithful, nourisheth each other, making them fruitful in al good workes.

[^3]: Where there is vnitie God geueth abundance of grace, as where the Apostles with other faithful were gathered, and continued in prayer, the Holie Ghost came vpon them al. And the multitude of beleuers [then increasing] had one hart and one soule. Act. 2. &. 4. v. 32.

[^4]: This last Gradual Psalme, as a conclusion exhorteth al to praise God: & for this end he made al creatures in heauen & in earth
