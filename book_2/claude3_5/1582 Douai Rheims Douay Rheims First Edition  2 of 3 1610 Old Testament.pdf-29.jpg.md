OF PSALMES:

<sup>4</sup> The sinner hath exasperated our Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath he shal not seeke.[^1]

<sup>5</sup> There is no God in his sight: his waies are defiled at al time. Thy iudgementes are taken away from his face: he shal rule ouer al his enemies[^2]

<sup>6</sup> For he hath sayd in his hart: I wil not be moued from generation vnto generation, without euil.[^3]

<sup>7</sup> Whose mouth is ful of cursing, and bitternesse, and guile: vnder his tongue labour and sorrow.

<sup>8</sup> He sitteth in waite with the rich in secrete places, to kil the innocent.

<sup>9</sup> His eyes looke vpon the poore: he lyeth in wayte in secret, as a lyon in his denne.

<sup>10</sup> He lyeth in wayte to take the poore man violently: violently to take the poore man whiles he draweth him. In his snare he wil humble him selfe, and shal fal when he shal haue dominion ouer the poore.

<sup>11</sup> For he hath sayed in his hart; God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see for euer.

<sup>12</sup> Arise Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poore.[^4]

<sup>13</sup> Wherfore hath the impious prouoked God? for he hath said in his hart; He wil not require.

<sup>14</sup> Thou seest, that thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayest deliuer them into thy handes. To thee is the poore left: to the orphane thou wilt be an helper

<sup>15</sup> Breake the arme of the sinner and malignant: his sinne shal be sought, and shal not be found.

<sup>16</sup> Our Lord shal reigne for euer, and for euer and euer: ye Gentiles shal perish from his land.[^5]

<sup>17</sup> Our Lord hath heard the desire of the poore: thy eare hath heard the preparation of their hart;[^6]

<sup>18</sup> To iudge for the pupil and the humble, that man adde no more to magnifie him selfe vpon the earth.[^7]

[^1]: y not seeke to recouer Gods fauour.
[^2]: The wicked doth dominier for a time, and thinketh he shal do so stil.
[^3]: a and neuer fal into any aduersitie but stil remaine without miserie or anie euil.
[^4]: The prayer of the iust in tribulation.
[^5]: ye vilest men.
[^6]: The iust ought alwayes to be readie prepared in hart, to suffer patiently al that shal happen vnto them.
[^7]: As the first workes of Christ in al humilitie and patience were strange, and hidden to the world: so his last iudgement shal be in maiestie and manifest to al in exalting the blessed and suppressing the wicked.
