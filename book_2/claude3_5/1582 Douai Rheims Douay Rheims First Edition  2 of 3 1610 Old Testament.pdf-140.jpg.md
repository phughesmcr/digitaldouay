The Booke

[^1]: The Prophetes also often speake in the preter tense, for the assurance of the thinges to come.

<sup>9</sup> From heaven thou hast made thy iudgement hearde: the earth trembled and was quiet.

<aside>Terrible signes from the firmament appearing before the day of iudgement, persecutors and others being terrified shal be astonished and silent.</aside>

When God arose vnto iudgement, <sup>10</sup> that he might saue al the meeke of the earth.

<aside>God wil come to iudge the world, more specially for the iusts sake.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Because the cogitation of man shal confesse to thee: and the remaines of the cogitation shal keepe festiual day to thee.

[^2]: Men that shal seriously thinke and meditate vpon these thinges, wil praise and thanke God for them: and the effect, and sweete repast of such meditation, shal make as it were a great festiual day, in the deuout soule spiritually ioyned with God.

<sup>12</sup> Vowe ye, and render to our Lord your God: al ye that round about him bring giftes.

[^3]: The soule thus inflamed with Gods loue, is then apt of gratitude, for his goodnes towardes man, to make vowes of thinges whereto we are not obliged, but most necessarie it is to be maturely aduised, and not rashly, nor lightly to vow; for being once vowed, we are strictly bound to whatsoever we haue lawfully promised. And it is great sinne to vow vndiscreetly.

<sup>13</sup> To the terrible, and him that taketh away the spirite of princes, terrible to the kinges of the earth.

[^4]: Remembring that for vowes, and al other workes we must answer to God, who is a terrible iudge, readie to punish in bodie and soule, sparing none for the greatnes, nor princes, nor kinges, nor vulgar sorte, for al are to him alike.

Psalme LXXVI.

<aside>Gods special protection of the seruant. a. key. Anie faithful deuout person meditating Gods benefites, examineth his conscience, that nothing be in his soule, that may offend God. Who is alwayes readie to forgeue: 11. and therfore he stil prayeth his purpose to serue God sincerely, 15. particularly remembring the deliuerie of Israel from Ã†gypt.</aside>

Vnto the end, for *a Idithun*, a psalme *b to Asaph*.

<aside>a For Idithun to sing, or to make tune for it. b For the faithful congregation to consider Gods benefites.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> With my voice I haue cried to our Lord: with my voice to God and he attended to me.

<aside>c Hauing heretofore prayed, d I haue obtained.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> In the day of my tribulation I sought God, with my handes in the night before him: and I was not deceiued.

<aside>e Especially being in tribulation, and praying with hart and handes lifted vp, as wel in the nightes day: f I was not frustrate of my prayer.</aside>
