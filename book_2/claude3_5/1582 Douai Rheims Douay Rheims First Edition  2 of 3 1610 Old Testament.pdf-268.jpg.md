# THE BOOKE OF PROVERBES.

[^1] Al fiue are Canonical and assured holie Scripture: as is shewed before: and may be further proued of the two later, which Protestants denie. It is also euident that King Salomon was Author of the three former: as S. Ierom, S. Augustin, and other Fathers proue by the holie text it selfe. As it is likewise certaine that he either writte, or at least by diuine inspiration vttered much more then is now extant . For the holie Scripture (3. Reg. 4.) testifieth, that he spake three thousand Parables: and his Songes were a thousand and fiue. He disputed of trees from the cedar that is in Libanus, vnto the hyssop which cometh out of the wal: and he discoursed of beastes, and foules, and creeping wormes, and fishes. Iosephus (li. 8. c. 2. Antiq.) folowing some other Edition, saith his songes were fiue thousand, and parables (as the ordinarie text hath) three thousand. For he dedicated a parable (saith Iosephus) throughout euerie kinde of trees, from the hyssop to the cedar. In like maner he treated of beastes, and other liuing creatures of the earth, water, and ayre. For he was not ignorant of anie natural thing, neither omitted to treate therof, but clerly explicated al their natural proprieties. Most briefly S. Ierom declareth both the Author, and matter of these three bookes, saying: Salomon the Peaceable, and amiable of our Lord <sup>a</sup> teacheth manners: <sup>b</sup> teacheth the nature (of creatures) <sup>c</sup> ioyneth the Church and Christ: and singeth the sweete bridal song of the holie Mariage.

[^2] Other bookes of Salomon not extant.

[^3] A brief summe of these three: a Prouerbs, b Ecclesiastes, c Canticles.

# THE ARGVMENT OF THE PROVERBES

[^4] The first booke called Prouerbes, that is, common & vsual pithie sentences, short in wordes, ample in sense; and Parables, signifying likenes or similitudes, whereby more important thinges are vnderstood then expressed; instructeth and exhorteth new beginners, to lerne, and practise al sortes of vertues, the only right way to true Wisdome and eternal happines. It may be diuided into foure partes. In the first nine chapters the author interposing certaine general preceptes, produceth Wisdome her selfe inuiting al men to seeke her, for the spiritual profite, they shal therby enioy. From thence to the 25. chap. he geueth sundrie more particular preceptes, as wel for embracing vertues, as shunning of vices. In the next fiue chapters, more like preceptes of the same author, are added by the care of King Ezechias. In the two last chapters, either an other Author, or rather the same vnder an other title, commendeth to al men certaine most excellent preceptes, receiued of his mother, wherin he admonisheth the praise of a right wise woman: propheticaly the Catholique Church.
