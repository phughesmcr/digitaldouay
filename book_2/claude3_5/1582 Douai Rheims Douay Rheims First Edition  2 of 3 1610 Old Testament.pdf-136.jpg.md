Thou hast redeemed the rod of thine inheritance: mount Sion, in which thou hast dwelt.

[^1] An other reason why God wil conserue his Church, is, because he hath deliuered it often in strong arme; as from bondage in Ægypt, from persecution and oppression in the time of Iudges, and kinges, and lastly redemed it from the tyrannie of the diuel by Christs death.

<sup>3</sup> Lift vp thy handes vpon their prides for euer: how great thinges hath the enimie done malignantly in the holy place?

[^2] Thirdly the pride of the enimies moueth God to reuenge their wickednes, and so to deliuer his owne people.

<sup>4</sup> And they that hate thee haue gloried: in the middes of thy solemnitie.

[^3] They pretend to kepe solemne feastes like to thyne.

They haue sette their signes, for signes: <sup>5</sup> and haue not knowne, as in the issue on high.

[^4] They set vp altars against thyne altares, or some new deuised external shew, against the holie Rites of the Church: and that in publike places, in the endes of high wayes, or portes, and pinnacles.

As in a wood of trees they haue with axes <sup>6</sup> cut out the gates therof together: in hatchet and chippaxe they haue cast it downe.

[^7] The weake complaine that God sheweth not wonted signes, nor sendeth succourse to his people, by raising some prophet, or other meanes to helpe them.

<sup>10</sup> How long ô God shal the enimie vpbraide: the aduersarie prouoke thy name for euer?

<sup>11</sup> Why doest thou turne away thy hand, and thy right hand, out of the middes of thy bosom for euer?

<sup>12</sup> But God our king before the worldes: he hath wrought saluation in the middes of the earth.

<aside>Luc. 3. 70.</aside>

[^8] The perfect as answereth, that God hath, and wil protecte his people.

<sup>13</sup> Thou in thy strength hast confirmed the sea: thou hast crushed the head of Dragons in the waters.

[^9] Made the redde sea like walles: drowned Pharao and his hoste.
