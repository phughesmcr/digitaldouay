THE BOOKE

<sup>12</sup>Put their princes as Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana.

[^1] Al their princes: <sup>13</sup>which haue saide: Let vs possesse the Sanctuary of God for an inheritance.

[^2] <sup>14</sup>My God put them as a wheele: and as stubble before the face of the winde.

<sup>15</sup>Euen as fire that burneth a wood & as a flame that burneth the mountaines:

<sup>16</sup>So shalt thou pursue them in thy tempest:and in thy wrath thou shalt truble them.

<sup>17</sup>Fil their faces with ignominie: and they wil seeke thy name, ô Lord.

[^3] <sup>18</sup>Let them be ashamed, and trubled for euer and euer: and let them be confounded, and perish.

[^4] <sup>19</sup>And let them know that Lord is thy name, thou onlie the Highest in al the earth.

<sup>3</sup>my soule coueteth, and *d* fainteth vnto the courtes of our Lord.

[^7] My hart, and *e* my flesh haue reioiced toward the liuing God.

[^6]: For men afflicted in this vale of miserie. b By the children of Core not being musicians (but porters in the temple,1. Par.26.) S. Augustin here and in other titles of Psalmes, vnderstandeth the faithful children of Christ.

[^7]: The glorious mansion in heauen, which God hath prepared for the iust. d Vehement desires do sometimes depriue vs of external sense.

[^8]: The mind reioycing in hope, the bodie is also recreated, releeued, and reuiued, which before was dull: and heauie.
