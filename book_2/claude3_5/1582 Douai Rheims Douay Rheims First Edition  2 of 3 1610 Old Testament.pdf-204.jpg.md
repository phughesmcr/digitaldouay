<sup>5</sup> Our Lord on thy righthand, *m* hath broken kinges in the day of his wrath.

[^1] Kings that sometimes persecute Christians, are subdued with other people to Christ.

<sup>6</sup> He *n* shal iudge in nations, he *o* shal fil ruines, he *p* shal crush the heads in the land of manie.

[^2] He shal iudge and punish the incredulous people, *s* make great slaughters amongst those that resist: *t* and bring princes with their pompous kingdoms to nothing.

<sup>7</sup> Of the torrent in the way he shal drinke: *r* therfore shal he exalt the head.

[^3] He shal in the meane time (and also his best servants) suffer much tribulation in this life: *r* and for the same be h ghly exalted in life euerlasting.

ANNOTATIONS. CIX.

Christs Priest-hood *pre eminently* both in function and in effect.

*A priest for euer.*] In two respects Christ is a Priest for euer: in that from the first instant of his Incarnation he was, and remaineth a Priest, now also in heauen: and al other Priestes are his ministerial vicares, not successors. So that Christ is stil essential & principal, whiles they doe, he by them doth the same, as the principal Priest. Wherup on (saith S. Paul (1. Cor. 4.) So let a man thinke of vs, as of the ministers of Christ, and dispesers of the mysteries of God. Secondly by daily offering Sacrifice by the handes of his Priestes, doth continually pacifie Gods wrath, in behalf of those sinners, for whom it is duly applied, euen to the end of the world. Wheras the Priesthood of Aaron, and of al others in the old Testament, ceased by their deathes, both in the office, and in the effect.

The resem-blance of Christs and Melchisedecs Priesthood.

*According to the order of Melchisedech.*] As Melchisedech, king of peace and iustice, without father, mother, or genealogie, expressed in holie Scriptures, or otherwise knowen to the world, was Priest of the Highest, offered bread and wine, in visible sacrifice; communicating with both Chananites and Hebrewes, blessed Abraham, and tooke tithes of him and his subiectes: so Christ the true King of peace & iustice, without father of his humanitie, without mother of his Diuinitie, the Sonne of God, of ineffable genealogie, borne of a virgin in his humanitie, the Priest of God, offereth Sacrifice (not only bloodie on the Crosse, but also) vnbloudie in the forme of bread and wine, continueth the same by the ministerie of other Priestes, maketh al nations partakers therof, blesseth them and receiueth of them al dutiful and religious seruice, as of his subiectes.
