OF PSALMES. 61

At <sup>m</sup> euening shal weeping abide: and in the morning gladnesse.[^1]

It often changed from sorow to comforte, and from comforte to sorow.

<sup>7</sup> And I said in my abundance: <sup>n</sup> I wil not be moued for euer.[^2]

<sup>8</sup> O Lord <sup>o</sup> in thy wil, thou hast geuen strength to my beautie. Thou hast <sup>p</sup> turned away thy face from me, and I became troubled.[^3]

<sup>9</sup> To thee ô Lord <sup>q</sup> I wil crie: and I wil pray to my God.[^4]

<sup>10</sup> What profite is in my bloud, whiles I descend into corruption?

Shal dust confesse to thee, or declare thy truth?

<sup>11</sup> Our Lord hath heard, and had mercie on me: our Lord is become my helper.

<sup>12</sup> Thou hast turned my mourning into ioy vnto me: thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladnes.

<sup>13</sup> That my glorie may sing to thee: and I be not compunct: Lord my God for euer <sup>r</sup> wil I confesse to thee.[^5]
