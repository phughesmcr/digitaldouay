OF PSALMES 129

<sup>3</sup> Let them be confounded, and be ashamed, that seeke my soule.

<sup>4</sup> Let them be turned away backward, and be ashamed that wil me euils.

Let them be turned away forthwith ashamed, that say to me: wel, wel.

<sup>5</sup> Let al that seeke thee reioyce, and be glad in thee, and let them say alwayes: Our Lord be magnified: which loue thy saluation.

<sup>6</sup> But I am needie and poore: ô God helpe me: thou art my helper, and deliuerer: ô Lord be not slacke.

PSALME. LXX.

*King Dauid, or anie other iust person, prayeth God to continue his grace, A prayer for
and protection against the malice of the enimie. 5. Recounteth Gods perseuerance
mercie in deliuering him from falling into tentations. 6. prayeth for in vertue.
the same in old age, 9. with confidence of Gods spirit, 20. and promiseth the 7. key.
perpetual gratitude and praises.*

1 A Psalme a for Dauid, b of the sonnes of Ionadab, and c the former captiues.

<aside>a Though this Psalme (as also diuers others) is intitled to, or for Dauid, it proueth not that some other was the author therof, but the Seuentie Interpreters insinuate hereby, that it perteineth in more particular sense to Dauid, growing old; b they adde also the sonnes of Ionadab a most holie familie, c who for their singular pietie, were suffered to remaine in Ierusalem, in the first captiuitie. Ierem. 35.</aside>

IN thee ô Lord I haue hoped, let me not be confounded for euer: <sup>2</sup> in thy iustice deliuer me, and rescue me.

Incline thine eare to me, and saue me.

<sup>3</sup> Be vnto me for a God protector, and for a fensed place: that thou maist saue me:

Because thou art my firmament, and my refuge.

<sup>4</sup> My God deliuer me out of the hand of the sinner, and out of the hand of him that doth against the law, and of the vniust.

<sup>5</sup> Because thou art my patience ô Lord: ô Lord my hope from my youth.

<aside>† Through thy grace I haue patience to expect thy pleasure, when I shal be releeued.</aside>
