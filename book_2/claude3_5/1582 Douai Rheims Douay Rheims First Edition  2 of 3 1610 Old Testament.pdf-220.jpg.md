THE BOOKE

<sup>26</sup> I have uttered my wayes, and thou hast heard me: teach me thy iustifications.

<sup>27</sup> Instruct me the way of thy iustifications: and I shal be exercised in thy meruelous workes.

<sup>28</sup> My soule c hath slumbered for tediousnes: d confirme me in thy wordes.

[^1] Being in so great anguish that I am almost distracted, or overcome, d I cal to thee O God, that thou wilt conserue me, that I wil kepe thy law, vttered by thy wordes.

<sup>29</sup> c Remoue from me the way of iniquitie: and according to thy law, f haue mercie on me.

<aside>Protect me that I fal not to iniquitie. f And of thy mercie conserue me in state of grace.</aside>

<sup>30</sup> I haue chosen the way of truth: I haue not forgotten thy iudgements.

<sup>31</sup> I haue cleaued to thy testimonies ô Lord: g do not confound me.

[^2] Suffer me not to be confounded.

<sup>32</sup> h I ranne the way of thy commandments: i when thou didst dilate my hart.

[^3] Man is able, and doth runne in the right way of Gods commandments, i yet not of himselfe, but when God replenisheth his hart with grace.

He.

<sup>33</sup> a Set me a law ô Lord the way of thy iustifications: and I wil seeke after it alwayes.

[^4] I mercifully teach thy law in myn affliction, make me to loue it, and to desire to be iustified, b so shal I surely and alwayes seeke it.

<sup>34</sup> c Geue me vnderstanding, d and I wil search thy law: and I wil keepe it with my whole hart.

[^5] After thou hast geuen me a desire to kepe thy law, geue me also vnderstanding. d then shal I fruitfully search it. For this is the right order (as before in the first and second verses) first to loue Gods lawe, to be iustified, and to become immaculate; and then to search to know the lawe, and so it is more easily lerned.

<sup>35</sup> Conduct me into the path of thy commandments: f because I would it.

[^6] Gods grace first draweth and leadeth, f then freewil inflamed with desire effectually concurreth.

<sup>36</sup> g Incline my hart into thy testimonies: and h not into auarice.

[^7] Stil the Prophet inculcateth the necessitie of Gods grace, as wel to make vs desire that is good, h as to flee from euil.

<sup>37</sup> Turne away mine eies that they see not vanitie: k in thy way quicken me.

[^8] It is necessarie also to pray that God wil take away occasions, which might moue to sinne: k and also grant his helping grace to progresse in vertue.
