OF PSALMES. 77

*God, resigning himself to Gods wil, confessing his owne iniquitie, and
humbly praying for Gods helpe.*

<sup>1</sup> A Psalme of Dauid, in a recordation of the sabbath.

<aside>In remembrance that by sinne we lost the rest and peace, which man had in the state of
innocencie; secondly we lost the peace of conscience; thirdly the rest and peace of eternal
felicitie.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> LORD rebuke me not in thy furie: nor chastise me in
thy wrath.

[^1]

<sup>3</sup> Because thy arrowes are fast sticked in me: and thou hast
fastened thy hand vpon me.

[^2]

<sup>4</sup> There is no health in my flesh, at the face of thy wrath:
my bones haue no peace at the face of my sinnes.

[^3]

<sup>5</sup> Because mine iniquities are gone ouer my head: and as a
heauie burden are become heauie vpon me.

[^4]

<sup>6</sup> My scarres are putrified and corrupted, because of my
folishnes.

[^5]

<sup>7</sup> I am become miserable, and am made crooked euen to the
end: I went sorowful al the day.

[^6]

<sup>8</sup> Because my loynes are filled with illusions: and there is no
health in my flesh.

<sup>9</sup> I am afflicted and am humbled excedingly: I rored for the
groning of my hart.

[^7]

[^1]: Condemne me not to eternal paine: c nor punish me in purgatorie fire; but purge me so in
this life, that the purging fire be not needful. By which fire (saith S Augustin) though some shal
be saued (grauiori tamen et ille ignis, quam quidquid potest homo pati in hac vita) yet that
fire shal be more greuous, then whatsoever a man can suffer in this life. S. Gregory also expoundeth this same place, as if Dauid sayd thus: I know it wil come to passe, that after the
end of this life, some shal be cleansed by purging flames, some shal be vnder the sentence of
eternal damnation. But because I do esteme that transitorie fire more intolerable then al present tribulation, I desire not only not to be rebuked in furie of eternal damnation, but also
I feare to be purged in the wrath of transitorie correction. Thou therefore O Lord whom I
serue in my spirite, whom I know to be the Sauiour of al men, rebuke me not in furie of perpetual damnation, nor chastise me in wrath of purging punishment. See Annotat. Psal. 6.

[^2]: Afflictions of mind and bodie sent by thy iust iudgement. c thou hast stroke me with an
heauie hand.

[^3]: I already feele in my flesh, in al my bones, and nowtes great affliction, g considering
thy iustice, h and my sinnes.

[^4]: which are excedingly increased, almost ouerwhelming my spirite. k sinnes not washed away
by penance by their weight carie the soule into more and more wickednes.

[^5]: stil corrupting those partes which were whole before, as a pestered sore that is not cured.

[^6]: not able to goe straight to do anie good workes, being guiltie of greuous sinnes.

[^7]: from the sorrow of my hart, my voice hath broken out into clamour.
