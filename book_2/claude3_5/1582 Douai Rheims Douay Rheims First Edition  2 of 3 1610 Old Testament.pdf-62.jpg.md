THE BOOKE

Thou hast often deliuered me. This verse is most aptly applied in al
afflictions of our soules to Gods wil, namely whensoever we receiue the
B. Sacrament; likewise in the houre of death, and at manie other times.

<sup>7</sup>Thou hast hated them that obserue vanities, vnprofitably.
<sup>8</sup>But I haue hoped in our Lord: I shal reioyce and be ioyful
in thy mercie.

Because thou hast respected my humilitie, thou hast saued my
soule out of necessities.

<sup>9</sup>Neither hast thou shut me vp in the handes of the enemie: thou hast set me feete in a large place.[^1]

<sup>10</sup>Haue mercie vpon me ô Lord because I am in tribulation:
myne eies is trubled for wrath, my soule, and my bellie:

<sup>11</sup>Because my life is decayed for sorowe: and my yeares for gronings.[^2]

My strength is weakened for pouertie; and by bones are trubled.

<sup>12</sup>Aboue al myne enemies I am made a reproch both to my neighbours exceedingly: and a feare to my acquaintance.[^3]

They that saw me, fled forth from me: I am forgotten, from <sup>13</sup>the hart as one dead.

I am made as a vessel destroyed: <sup>14</sup>because I haue heard the reprehension of manie that abide round about:

In that whiles, they assembled together against me, they consulted to take my soule.

<sup>15</sup>But I haue hoped in thee ô Lord: I sayd: Thou art my God: <sup>16</sup>my lottes are in thy handes.

Deliuer me out of the handes of my enemies, and from them
that persecute me.

<sup>17</sup>Illustrate thy face vpon thy seruant, saue me in thy mercie:[^4]

that I may vnderstand that is right. and through thy mercie deliuer
force of myne aduersaries.

<sup>18</sup>Lord let me not be confounded, because I haue inuocated
thee.

Let the impious be ashamed, and brought downe into hel:
<sup>19</sup>let the deceitful lippes be made mute.

Which speake iniquitie against the iust, in pride, and in abuse.[^5]

[^1]: not suffered me to be shut vp.

[^2]: al my partes external and internal, body and mind are trubled.

[^3]: My freindes dare not conuerse with me, lest they incurre displeasure for my sake.

[^4]: Make thy light to shine in my soule, me from the

[^5]: so proudly behauing them selues, as if they had no superior, neither in earth nor in heauen, to whom they shal account: m. and abusing their present powre and authoritie, which they haue of God.
