OF PSALMES. 183

I walked through in the innocencie of my hart, in the middes of my house.

<sup>3</sup> I did not propose before mine eies any vniust thing: I hated them that do preuarication.

<sup>4</sup> A peruerse hart hath not cleaued to me: the malignant declining from me I knew not.

<sup>5</sup> One secretly detracting from his neighbour, him did I persecute. One of a proud eye, and vnsatiable hart, with him I did not eate.

<aside>That is, al and euerie one thus wickedly disposed I abhorred.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Mine eies are towards the faithful of the earth that they may sitte with me: he that walketh in the immaculate way, he did minister to me.

<aside>I kept such vnder, as a seruant or slaue.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> He that doth proudly shal not dwel in the middes of my house: he that speaketh vniust thinges, hath not directed in the sight of mine eies.

<aside>Prospered not, gote no benefite by me.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> In the morning did I kil al the sinners of the earth: that I might destroy out of the citie of our Lord, al those that worke iniquitie.

<aside>Speedely and without delay I cutte of al disordered people:</aside>

PSALME. CI.

*A sinner in affliction of mind prayeth God to deliuer him, 10. desolate of al other helpe. 13. conuerteth comfort in Gods eternal goodnes, and singular mercie, in redeeming mankind, and propagating the Church. 24. Prayeth to be made mature in vertue before he die, that he may liue with God: 26. who only and wholy being immutable, establisheth his seruantes for euer.*

The first penitential Psalme, the 7. key.

1 The prayer of the poore, when he shal be anxious, and shal make his petition before our Lord.

2 LORD heare my prayer: and let my crie come to thee.

[^2]

â€  Turne,

[^1]: that others might not be corrupted by them.

[^2]: Euerie petition is a prayer, b and that which procedeth from more feruent affection, is called a crie, though it burst not out into clamour, nor perhaps into anie voice at al. For God said to Moyses, praying in mere silence, but with vehemencie of spirite (Exod. 14.) Why criest thou to me?
