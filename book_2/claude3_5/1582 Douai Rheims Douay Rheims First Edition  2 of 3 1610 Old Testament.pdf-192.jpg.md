<sup>11</sup>Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the corde of your inheritance.

<sup>12</sup>When they were of small number, very few and seiourners therof:

<sup>13</sup>And they passed from nation into nation, & from kingdom to an other people.

<sup>14</sup>He leift not a man to hurt them: and he rebuked kings for their sake.

<sup>15</sup>Touch not my annointed, and toward my prophetes be not malignant.

<sup>16</sup>And g he called a famine vpon the land: and he destroyed al the strength of bread.

<sup>17</sup>He sent a man before them: Ioseph was sold to be a servant.

<sup>18</sup>They humbled his feete in fetters, yron passed through his soule, <sup>19</sup>vntil his word came.

<sup>20</sup>The word of our Lord inflamed him: the king sent, and loosed him; the prince of the people, and released him.

<sup>21</sup>He appointed him lord of his house: and prince of al his possession.

<sup>22</sup>That he might instruct his princes as himselfe: and might teach his ancientes wisedom.

<sup>23</sup>And Israel entered into Ægypt, and Iacob was a seiourner in the land h of Cham.

<sup>24</sup>And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthned them ouer their enemies.

<sup>25</sup>He i turned their hart, that they hated his people: and worke guile toward his servantes.

<sup>26</sup>He sent Moyses his servant: Aaron, k him selfe whom he chose.

<sup>27</sup>He did put in them the wordes of his signes, and of his wonders in the Land of Cham.

<sup>28</sup>He sent l darkenes, and obscured: and did m not exasperate his wordes.

[^4]May it be vnderstood, or beleued (saith S. Augustin) that God turneth the hart of man to committe sinnes? Or is it a sinne, that he turneth the hart to hate the people of God? Or to worke guile toward his servantes? Who wil say this? What then, is God author of these so greveous sinnes, who is not to be supposed the author of a most smal sinne? This learned Father therfore answereth, that God perverteth not a right hart, but turneth that which is selfe perverse, to the hatred of this people, where he might vse that evil wel, not by making them evil, but by bestowing vpon his owne people good thinges, which the evil might easily envie. Which hatred of theirs how God vsed both to the exercise of his people (which is profitable to vs) & to the glorie of his owne name, the thinges that folow do teach vs, which are here remembred to his praise.
