[^1]

<sup>43</sup>Thou hast exalted the righthand of them that oppresse him: thou hast made al his enimies ioyful.

<sup>44</sup>Thou hast turned away the helpe of his sword: and hast not holpen him in battel.

<sup>45</sup>Thou hast destroied him from p emundation: and his seat thou hast broken downe to the ground.

*p From the vse of Sacrifices and Sacraments, whereby sinners were wount to be cleansed.*

<sup>46</sup>Thou hast lessened the daies of his time: thou hast ouerwhelmed him with confusion.

<sup>47</sup>How long 么 Lord doest thou turne away for euer: shal thy wrath burne as a fire?

<sup>48</sup>Remember what my substance is: for hast thou made al the children of men in vaine?

<sup>49</sup>Who is the man that shal liue, and shal not see death: shal deliuer his soule from the hand of hel?

<sup>50</sup>Where are thyne old mercies 么 Lord, as thou swarest to Dauid in thy truth?

<sup>51</sup>Be mindeful 么 Lord of the reproch of thy seruantes (which I haue held in my bosome) of manie nations.

<sup>52</sup>Which thine enimies haue reproched 么 Lord: which they haue reproched q the commutation of thy Christ.

*q As though Christ were changed and turned from vs.*

<sup>53</sup>Blessed be our Lord for euer: r Be it, be it.

*r So we wish and pray that al may blesse and praise thee. Amen.*

ANNOTIONS, PSALME LXXXVIII.

[^2] Although, Christians signified by the children or successors of Dauid, sinne most grieuously, yea suppose they wil sinne with desperation (which S. Augustin) and obstinately persist in sinne, that they offend the eyes of their Father, & deserue to be disinherited: &c. Yet for these Christ shal not remaine without inheritance, the corne shal not also perish for the chafe, some fishes shal be gathered out of the nette into vessels, notwithstanding the euil fishes are cast away. And a litle after, the same Doctor discoursing of eternal glorie both in bodie and soule, of those that dye in Gods fauour, sayth; These thinges are promised concerning Christ, very certaine, very firme, very plaine, and vndoubted. For albeit some thinges are conteined in mysteries, yet some thinges are so manifest, that by them the obscure thinges may most easily be cleared.

[^3] Againe S. Augustin, addeth vpon the next verses folowing: God performed not these promises in Dauid, that when thou seest they were not fulfilled in Dauid, which necessitily must be fulfilled, thou maist seke an other, in whom it may be shewed that they were fulfilled. God promised some thing (a kingdom) for euer of Dauids seede: and Salomon was borne: and became of so great wisdom, and so great prudence, that Gods promise

[^1]: oppressed by the Assi ans, Babylonians, Persians, Grecians, and Romanes: as in the Church impugned by innumerable sortes of Heretikes and other Infidels.

[^2]: Though Christians do sinne yet Christ loseth not his Church.

[^3]: Hard places explicated by the cleare. Gods promises to Dauid were not fulfilled in Salomon, but in Christ.
