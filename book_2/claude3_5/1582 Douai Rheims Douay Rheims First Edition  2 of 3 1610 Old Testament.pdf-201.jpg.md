OF PSALMES. 201

I wil reioyce, and wil diuide Sichem; and I wil mesure the
vale of tabernacles.

<sup>9</sup> Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim the protection of my head.

<sup>10</sup> Iuda is my king: Moab the potte of my hope.
Vpon Idumea I wil extend my shoe: the strangers are made
my freindes.

<sup>11</sup> Who wil conduct me into a sensed citie? who wil conduct
me into Idumea?

<sup>12</sup> Wilt not thou ô God, which hast repelled vs, and wilt not
thou goe forth ô God in our hoastes?

<sup>13</sup> Geue vs helpe out of tribulation: because mans saluation is
vayne.

<sup>14</sup> In God we shal doe strength: and he wil bring our enemies
to nothing.

<sup>2</sup> O God conceale not my prayse: because the mouth of a The ennemies of Christ.
the sinner, and the mouth of b the deceitful man is open
vpon me.

[^1]

<sup>3</sup> They c haue spoken against me with deceitful tongue, and
with wordes of hatred they haue compassed me: and they haue
impugned me without cause.

[^2]

<sup>4</sup> For that they should loue me, they backbited me: but I
prayed.

<sup>5</sup> And they set against me euil thinges for good: and hatred
for my loue.

<sup>6</sup> Appoint d a sinner ouer him: and e let the diuel stand on his
righthand.

[^3]

[^1]: b The Pharisees and Herodians (Mat. 22.) with their mouth acknowleged Christ a true speaker, and a teacher of the way of God in truth, therby to draw him into danger, and to shedde his bloud.

[^2]: c At other times they accused him of great crimes, lastly of treason against Cesar.

[^3]: d A prediction that Iudas would not make recourse to anie good counseller, but complaine of his miserable tormented conscience to the wicked, who gaue him no comfort at al, e and so desparing, the diuel perswaded him to hang himselfe.
