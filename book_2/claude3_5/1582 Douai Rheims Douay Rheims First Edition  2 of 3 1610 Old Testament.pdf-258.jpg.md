[^1]: Made him afterwards king of a great people.

[^2]: Al mankind was vnworthie before Christ, that God should be reuealed vnto them, especially that he should haue care of the progenie of men, after their sinne.

[^3]: In dede man in himself, in his owne nature and frailtie, is but a vaine and transitorie creature, passing from life to death, as a shadow that can not consist of it selfe, neither can man without God.

[^4]: By a poetical description he prayeth for Gods helpe, as if God should make the heauens to bow, and so descend, or make the mountaines smoke, as when Moyses receiued the law; or declare himself by Meteors, as foloweth:

[^5]: Tribulations or tentations.

[^6]: Children of the Church, but of euil life.

[^7]: *They speake in vanitie that promise to kepe Gods Law, and performe it not.*

[^8]: In that principal instrument, apt for a new songe; and for extra ordinarie benefites.

[^9]: Both Iewes & Christians that liue not wel, are as strangers that frame to themselues such a false felicitie, and haue defected: making riches or worldlie pleasures their God.

[^10]: True happines consisteth not in worldlie thinges.

[^11]: But in preferring God before al.

<sup>2</sup>My mercie, and my refuge: my defender, and my deliuerer. My protector, and I haue hoped in him, who subdueth my people vnder me.

<sup>3</sup>Lord what is man, that thou art made knowne to him: or the sonne of man; that thou esteemest him?

<sup>4</sup>Man is made like to vanitie: his dayes passe as a shadow.

<sup>5</sup>Lord incline thy heauens, and descend: touch the mountaynes, and they wil smoke.

<sup>6</sup>Lighten lightening, and thou shalt disperse them: shoote out thine arrowes, and thou shalt destroy them.

<sup>7</sup>Send forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliuer me from manie waters: from the hand of children strangers.

<sup>8</sup>Whose mouth hath spoken vanitie: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquitie.

<sup>9</sup>O God I wil sing to thee a new song: in the psalter of ten stringes I wil sing to thee.

<sup>10</sup>Who geuest saluation to kinges: who hast redeemed Dauid <sup>11</sup>thy seruant from the malignant sword: deliuer me.

And rescue me out of the hand of children strangers, whose mouth hath spoken vanitie, and their right hand, is the right hand of iniquitie.

<sup>12</sup>Whose sonnes, are as new plantes in their youth.

Their daughters comly trimmed: decked about after the similitude of a temple.

<sup>13</sup>Their storehouses ful, flowing out of this into that.

<sup>14</sup>Their ewes ful of yong, abunding in their going forth: their oxen are fatte.

There is no ruine of wal, nor passage, nor crie in their streetes.

<aside>*trans-migra-tion.*</aside>

<sup>15</sup>They haue said, that it is a happie people, which hath these things: blessed is the people, whose God is our Lord.
