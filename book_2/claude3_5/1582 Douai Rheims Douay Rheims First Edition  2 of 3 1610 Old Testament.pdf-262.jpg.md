[^1] Thinges subject to Gods knowledge and wisdom are innumerable.

[^2] Al these and the like benefits do shew Gods incomparable greatnes, wisdom, and goodnes.

<sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord, and great is his strength: and of his wisdom there is no number.

<sup>6</sup> Our Lord receiving the meeke: & humbling sinners euen to the ground.

<sup>7</sup> Sing ye to our Lord in confession: sing ye to our God on harpe.

<sup>8</sup> Who covereth the heaven with cloudes: and prepareth rayne for the earth.

Who bringeth forth grasse in the mountaines: and herbe for the service of men.

<sup>9</sup> Who geueth to beastes their foode: and to *b* the young rauens that cal vpon him.

*b* Both sacred and profane writers testifie, that rauens feing their yong ones, either without fethers, or to haue whitish, vnlike to theirs, as suspecting that they are not their owne birdes, but of some other kinde, leaue them destitute of meate; therfore God the autor of nature, and conseruer of al kindes of creatures, by his special prouidence, feedeth them: either by a certaine deaw hanging nere them in the ayre, as Isidorus supposeth, or by litle beastes, or flees, sent by Gods prouidence, which they catching into their mouthes, are nourished and brought vp, as S. Chrysostom teacheth, ser. in Heliam, or by what other meanes soeuer, al agree that yong rauens are neglected by their parents, and are seldom miraculously by Gods ordinance; by which example the Psalmist sheweth, that much more God hath care of men: especially of such men (saith S. Chrysostom.) as honour him with hymnes and praises, whom also he hath called to be his peculiar people, and his owne portion or inheritance.

<aside>Ho. in hunc psalm.</aside>

<sup>10</sup> He shal not haue pleasure in the strength of an horse: nor in the legges of a man shal he be wel pleased.

<sup>11</sup> Our Lord is wel pleased toward them that feare him: and in them, that hope vpon his mercie.

PSALME CXLVII.

[^3] Gods providence especially towardes the Church, the 6. key.

*Againe God is to be praised for his goodnes towards his peculiar people, 4. yea towards al the world: 7. but most abundantly towards his Church.*

Alleluia.

[^4] The Hebrews ioyne this Psalm with the precedent.

<sup>1</sup> O a Ierusalem praise our Lord: praise thy God Ã´ Sion.

*a* Ierusalem in the litter part of Dauids time, al the time of Salomon, and part of other kinges reignes til the captiuitie, had peace & prosperitie.
