OF PSALMES.

Delivering the needie from the hand of them that are stronger then he: the needie and poore from them that spoile him.

<sup>11</sup> Vniust witnesses rising vp, asked me the things that I knew not.[^1]

<sup>12</sup> They repayed me euil things for good, I sterilitie to my soule.[^2]

<sup>13</sup> But I when they were trublesome to me, *m* did put on cloth of heare.[^3]

I humbled my soule in fasting: and my prayer shal be turned into my bosome.

<sup>14</sup> As a *n* neighbour, as our brother, so did I please: as mour- ning and sorowful so was I humbled.[^4]

<sup>15</sup> And they *o* reioysed against me, and *p* came together: *q* scourges were gathered together vpon me, and I was *r* ig- norant.[^5]

<sup>16</sup> They were dissipated, and not compunct, they tempted me, they scorned me with scorning: they gnashed vpon me with their teeth.

<sup>17</sup> Lord *s* when wilt thou regard? *t* restore thou my soule from their malignitie, myne only one from the lions.[^6]

<sup>18</sup> I wil confesse to thee in *u* the great Church, in a graue *v* people I wil prayse thee.[^7]

<sup>19</sup> Let them not reioyce ouer me that are my aduersaries vniu- stly: *w* that hate me without cause, and twincle with the eies.[^8]

<sup>20</sup> Because they spake in deede *x* peaceably to me: and in the anger of the earth speaking they deuised guiles.[^9]

<sup>21</sup> And they *y* opened their mouth a wide vpon me: they said, Wel, wel, our eies haue seene.[^10]

[^5]: *o.p.q. al this was fulfilled r Our Lord knoweth not anie iust cause, why the Iewes so persecuted him, for they had no iust cause but meere malice.*

[^6]: *s as Psal. 21. and Mat. 27. God why hast thou forsaken me? not deliuered me from temporal death, nor yet from such consolation, as thou givest other Saincts in their agonies? t a prophecie of Christs resurrection.*
