<sup>13</sup> And man, when he was in honour, did not understand: he was compared to beasts without understanding, and became like to them.

[^1] A most pithie and brief consideration, for man to thinke, how absurdly, he being endowed with reason, understanding, & free wil, like unto Angels, and capable of eternal glorie, setteth his whole studie, and care upon corporal and temporal thinges, so making himselfe like unto brute beastes.

<sup>14</sup> This their way is a scandal to them: and afterward in their mouth they shal take pleasure.

[^2] This care of worldlie thinges is the stumbling block, and cause of eternal ruine: yet they shalbe obstinate, and praise their owne desires, stil persisting therin.

<sup>15</sup> As sheepe they are put in hel: death shal feede upon them. And the iust shal rule ouer them in the morning: and their aide shal waxe old in hel from their glorie.

[^3] Amongst other creatures a sheepe can least helpe her selfe in miserie: euen so the damned in hel are altogether vnable to deliuer themselues from thence, or to get any relief, & in the general resurrection they shal be most of al in miserie, as euer dying and neuer dead: the iust whom they wronged, shalbe their iudges, al freindes shal faile them, after they haue passed their glorie, and pleasure in this world.

<sup>16</sup> Neuerthelesse a God wil redeme my soule out of the hand of hel, when he shal take me.

<aside>The confidence of the iust.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> Feare not when a man shal be made rich: and when the glory of his house shal be multiplied,

<sup>18</sup> Because when he shal dye, he shal not take al thinges: neither shal his glorie goe downe with him.

[^4] He shal leaue al worldlie thinges and take nothing with him.

<sup>19</sup> Because his soule in his life shal be c blessed: he wil confesse to thee d when thou shalt do him good.

[^5] c temporally: d so long as he enioyeth worldlie profites he wil seme grateful to God;

<sup>20</sup> He shal enter in, euen to the progenies of his fathers: and he shal e not see light for euer.

[^6] e but they shal not see the true light of heauen.

<sup>21</sup> Man, when he was in honour, did not understand: he was compared to beasts without understanding, and became like to them.

[^7] Remember and consider Ã´ mortal man, that God made thee an excellent creature: which thou neglecting makest thyself like to a beast. As, v. 13.

PSALME. XLIX.

*Christ in his first coming calleth al Nations. 3. in his second wil iudge the world 7. In the meane time God exhorteth al men to serue him in puritie of vertue, which he much preferreth before external sacrifice of the old law 17. reprehending such as professe or teach the right way, and liue wickedly.*
