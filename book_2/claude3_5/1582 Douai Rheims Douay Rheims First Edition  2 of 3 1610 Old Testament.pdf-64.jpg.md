<sup>3</sup> Because I held my peace, my bones are inueterated, whiles I cried al the day.

[^1] not my greuious sinnes, I was stil sore afflicted. g though otherwise I ceased not to pray but without any fruite or good effect.

<sup>4</sup> Because day and night thy hand is made heauie vpon me: I am turned in my anguish, whiles i the thorne is fastened.

[^2] reducing me, i by remorse of myn owne conscience which telleth me that I deserue al this affliction.

<sup>5</sup> I haue made my sinne knowen to thee: and my iniustice I haue not hid.

[^3] do no longer dissemble with men nor am silent to thee, but expresly acknowledge my sinnes.

I said: I wil confesse against me my iniustice to our Lord: and thou hast forgeuen the impietie of my sinne.

<sup>6</sup> For this shal euerie holie one pray to thee, in time conuenient. But yet m in the floud of manie waters, they shal n not approche to him.

[^4] As I do now recal my selfe being stricken with Gods hand, so must euerie one that wil be purged from his sinnes and sanctified pray to thee, when he is afflicted. m Though calamities be meruelous great: like to a diluuie: n yet they shal not opresse him, that relieth vpon God.

<sup>7</sup> Thou art my refuge from tribulation, which hath compassed me: my exultation, deliuer me from them that compasse me.

<sup>8</sup> I wil geue thee vnderstanding, and wil instruct thee in the way, that thou shalt goe; I p wil fasten mine eies vpon thee.

<aside>God speaketh: promising by these tribulations to geue his seruants vnderstanding, and instruction: p with perpetual protection.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> Doe q not become as horse and mule, which haue no vnderstanding.

[^5] Be not therefore carelesse, like to brute beastes, but consider true of your actions.

In r bit and bridle binde fast their cheekes, that approch not to thee.

[^6] The Prophet or anie iust soule besecheth God to hold this fruitful hand of discipline ouer sinners, for their conuersion.

<sup>10</sup> Manie s are the scourges of a sinner, but t him that hopeth in our Lord mercie shal compasse.

<aside>Sinners deserue much punishment. t but repenting, and trusting in God shal finde his mercie.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Be v ioyful in our Lord and reioyce ye iust, and glorie al ye right of hart.

<aside>The end of true penance is ioy: to which therefore the prophet inuiteth al penitents.</aside>
