[^4]

<sup>2</sup>EXPECTING b I expected our Lord, and he hath attended to me.

[^4]: *a perteyning vnto the new Testament.*

[^5]: *b the faithful of the old and new Testament reioyce in the coming of Christ.*

[^6]: *c Christ by him selfe and by others preached the Gospel of saluation. d the multiplication of Christians therby.*

[^7]: *e No sacrifice of the old testament sufficed to satisfie Gods iustice for the sinnes of man. f Christ by the eare of obedience performed the redemption of man by his death, as was determined from eternitie. S. Paul our (eares) saith (bod-). See Annotations. Heb. 10.*
