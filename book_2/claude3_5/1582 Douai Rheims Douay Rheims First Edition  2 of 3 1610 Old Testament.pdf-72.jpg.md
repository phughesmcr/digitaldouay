THE BOOKE

[^1] <sup>22</sup>Arise thou hast sene ô Lord, keepe not silence: ô Lord departe not from me.

<sup>23</sup>Arise and attend to my iudgement: my God, and my Lord vnto my cause.

<sup>24</sup>Iudge me according to thy iustice ô Lord my God, and let them not reioyce ouer me

<sup>25</sup>Let them not say in their hartes: Wel, wel, to our soule: neither let them say: We haue deuoured him.

<sup>26</sup>Let a them blush and be ashamed together, that reioyce at my euils.

Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, that speake great things vpon me.

<sup>27</sup>Let b them reioyce and be glad, that wil my iustice: and let them say alwayes: Our Lord be magnified, that wil the peace of his seruant.

<sup>28</sup>And my tongue shal meditate thy iustice, thy prayse al the day.

PSALME XXXV.

*The prophet describeth the wicked malice of obstinate sinners: 6. Against which he opposeth Gods infinite goodnes, 9. with his prouident mercie towards the worst, and iust reward of the good; 12. praying to escape the dangerous gulfe of pride.*

[^2] <sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, to b the seruant of our Lord Dauid him selfe.

[^3] The c vniust hath said within him selfe, that he e would sinne: there is no feare of God before his eies

<sup>3</sup>Because he hath done deceitfully in his sight: d that his iniquitie may be found vnto hatred.

<sup>4</sup>The wordes of his mouth are iniquitie, and guile: he e would not vnderstand that he might doe wel.

[^1]: *Christs Resurrection is prophecied.*

<aside>a At the day of iudgement: the wicked shal receiue sentence of damnation.</aside>

<aside>b the blessed of eternal glorie.</aside>

[^2]: *Gods prouidence. The 5. key.*

[^3]: *More special by describing the state of men in the new testament, then in the old. b instruction for Dauid not as a king, or a prophet, but as the poore seruant of God.*

[^4]: *c Wittingly and resolutely preferring wicked life before vertuous.*

[^5]: *d God so hateth sinne committed of meere malice, that he commonly reiecteth such sinners, and more often offereth new graces to those, that sinne of frailtie, or ignorance.*

[^6]: *e Some ignorance is inuincible whē one hath a good wil to lerne, doing his endeuour to know the truth in doctrin, & his dutie in maners, but can not yet know these therof, and then he is excused before God, though he erre in opinion, or in fact: others are negligent to lerne, and their error is grosse ignorance and is a sinne, greater or lesse, according to the importance of the thing, which they ought to know. Others are more wilful, desiring to be ignorant, that they may sinne with the lesse remorse, or repining of their owne conscience, and this is affected ignorance, and most greeuous sinne.*
