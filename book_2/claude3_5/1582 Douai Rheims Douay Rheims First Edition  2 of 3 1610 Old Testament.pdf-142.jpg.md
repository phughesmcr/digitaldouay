[^1] A multitude of the sounding of waters: the cloudes gaue a voice.

[^2] Noise of waters meeting after the Israelites were passed, thunders and lightninges also hapened, to the terror of the persecutors, though not mentioned in Exodus.

For in deede arrowes doe passe: <sup>19</sup> the voice of thy thunder in a wheele.
Thy lighteninges shined to the rounde world: the earth was moued and trubled.
<sup>20</sup> Thy way in the sea, and thy pathes in many waters: and thy steppes shal not be knowne.
<sup>21</sup> Thou hast conducted thy people as sheepe: in the hand of Moyses and Aaron.

[^3] By the ministerie of Moyses and Aaron.

<sup>3</sup> How great thinges haue we heard and haue knowne them, and e our fathers haue told vs.

[^8] Which partly we know by written holie Scripture: f partly by Tradition.
