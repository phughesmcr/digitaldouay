<sup>3</sup>When he shal giue sleepe to his beloued: behold the inheritance of our Lord are children: the reward, the fruite of the wombe.

[^1] As arrowes in the hand of the mightie: so are the children of them that are shaken.

[^2] Moreouer as a strong archer striketh deepe with his arrowes: so they that patiently suffer much in this world, do multiplie good workes.

<sup>5</sup>Blessed is the man that hath filled his desire of them: he shal not be confounded when he shal speake to his enemies in the gate.
