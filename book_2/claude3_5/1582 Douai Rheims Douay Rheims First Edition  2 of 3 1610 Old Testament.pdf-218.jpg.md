<sup>5</sup> Would God my waies i might be directed, to keepe thy justifications.

[^1] Therefore the faithful seruant of God, knowing his owne insufficiencie, desireth that God by his grace wil direct and strengthen him, & to kepe his law, called justifications, because thereby man is made iust.

<sup>6</sup> Then shal I / not be confounded, when I shal looke throughly in al thy commandmentes.

[^2] They shal be safe from eternal confusion, when they shal kepe not only part, but al thy commandments. because breach of one bringeth confusion.

<sup>7</sup> I wil confesse to thee *n* in direction of hart: in that I haue lerned the *o* iudgementes of thy iustice.

<aside>*n* with sincere and synced affection, *o* for this great benefite, that I haue lerned, that thy law is according to most iust iudgement.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> I wil keepe thy iustifications: *p* forsake me not wholy.

[^3] I haue therefore a firme purpose, & do faithfully promise to kepe thy law, which maketh the keper therof iust. *q* Albeit thou suffer me sometimes to be in tribulation, or in tentation, yet forsake me not wholy. The Psalmist knew wel (saith S. Gregorie) that he might be profitably left a while, who prayed, that he should not be wholy forsaken.

Beth. House.

[^4] In this second Octonarie, as also in al the rest, the Holie Ghost by the prophets penne teacheth the meanes how to come to perfection in al vertues. Here by way of interrogation, as it were demanding how a young man, that is euerie man prone to worldlie pleasures, & flow in Gods seruice, shal beginne to correct his course? & Whereto the same Holie Ghost answereth, that he must kepe Gods law, called here his wordes. For al the wordes which God vttereth, are lawes to his seruants.

<sup>10</sup> With my whole hart I haue sought after thee: *d* repel me not from thy commandmentes.

[^5] The Psalmist now speaketh in the person of perfect iust men, or of the whole Church in general. Whose common praier seeketh God intirely. *d* And considering that this perfect good wil is the gift of God, prayeth that he wil conserue the same, and not suffer it to be altered, or to erre from his commandments.

<sup>11</sup> In my hart I haue hid thy * wordes: that I may not sinne to thee.

<aside>* *also*</aside>

[^6] An other sincere profession of a resolute good purpose not to sinne.

<sup>12</sup> Blessed art thou Ã´ Lord: *e* teach me thy iustifications.

[^7] A grateful aspiration praising God. *e* Againe the iust prayeth to be more and more instructed in iustifications: that which S. Iohn exhorteth vnto: He that is iust, let him yet be iustified. Apoc. 22.

<sup>13</sup> In my lippes, I haue pronounced al the *b* iudgementes of thy mouth.
