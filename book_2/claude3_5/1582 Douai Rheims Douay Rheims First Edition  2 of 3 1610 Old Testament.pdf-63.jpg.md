OF PSALMES. 63

<sup>20</sup> How great is the multitude of thy sweetenesse Ã´ Lord; which thou hast hid for them that feare thee.[^1]

Thou hast perfited it for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the children of men.[^2]

<sup>21</sup> Thou shalt hide them in the secrete of thy face from the disturbance of men.[^3]

Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.

<sup>22</sup> Blessed be our Lord: because he hath made his mercie merveilous to me in the fensed citie.

<sup>23</sup> But I haue said in the excesse of my minde: I am cast away from the sight of thine eies.[^4]

Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my praier, whiles I cried to thee.

<sup>24</sup> Loue our Lord al ye his sainctes: because our Lord wil require truth, & wil repay them abundantly that doe proudly.[^5]

<sup>25</sup> Doe ye manfully, and let your hart take courage, al ye that hope in our Lord.[^6]
