THE BOOKE

<sup>6</sup>Which wil not heare the voice of the inchanters, and of the sorcerer inchanting wisely.

<sup>7</sup>God shal breake their teeth in their mouth, the cheeke tooth of the lions, our Lord wil breake in peeces.

[^1]<sup>8</sup>They shal come to nothing as water running downe: he hath bent his bow til they be weakened.

<aside>Gods iust determination of punishing the wicked stil remaineth sure and readie, though execution be some while differred.</aside>

<sup>9</sup>As waxe that melteth, shal they be taken away: fyre hath falne on them, and they haue not seene the sunne.

[^2]<sup>10</sup>Before your thornes did vnderstand the old bryar: as liuing so in wrath he swalloweth them.

<sup>11</sup>The iust shal reioice when he shal see reuenge: he shal wash his handes in the bloud of a sinner.

[^3]<sup>12</sup>And man shal say: If certes there be fruite to the iust: there is a God certes iudging them on the earth.

[^3]: Before their malice can bring to effect, the great mischiefes which they plotte and purpose, God suddainly cutteth them of before they fully vnderstand it, either sicknesse or death, casteth them as it were aliue into hel.

[^5]: King Saul hauing thrise attempted in vaine to kil Dauid, (1.Reg. 18. v 11. & c. 19. v. 9.) sent some of his guard to seise him, from his owne house, that he might be slaine: but God moued the mind of Michol, to admonish him of the danger, and to helpe him away in safetie, though Saul thought she would haue been a scandal vnto him (or cause of ruine) by the handes of the Philistians: 1 Reg. 18. v. 21.
