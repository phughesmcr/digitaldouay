## PSALME II.

[^3] *Christs glorie, the World repining therat, 4. shal be propagated in al the world. 7. His diuine power as wel spiritual in conuerting mens hartes, as external, in future iustice, is prophecied.*

<sup>1</sup> WHy did the *a* Gentiles rage, and *b* peoples meditate vaine things?

<sup>2</sup> The *c* kings of the earth stood vp, and the *d* princes came together in one against our Lord, and against his Christ.

<sup>3</sup> Let *e* vs breake their bondes a sunder: and let vs cast away their yoke from vs.

<sup>4</sup> He that dwelleth in the heauens, shal *g* laugh at them: and our Lord shal scorne them.

<sup>5</sup> Then shal he speake to them in his *h* wrath, & in his *i* furie he shal truble them.

<sup>6</sup> But *k* I am appoynted king by him ouer Sion his holie hil, preaching his precept.

<sup>7</sup> The *l* Lord said to me; Thou art my *m* Sonne, I this day haue begotten thee.

<sup>8</sup> Aske of me, and I wil geue *n* thee the Gentiles, for thyne inheritance, and thy possession *o* the endes of the earth.

[^4] *a* Both gentiles *b* and Iewes stirre against Christ.

[^5] *c* Pilate and Herod.

[^6] *d* Annas and Caiphas.

[^7] *e* The voice of wicked men.

[^8] *f* & specially libertines striuing to shake of al discipline.

[^9] *g* God for al this wil turne out their madnes to the hartes of manie.

[^10] *h* seuerly reprehend, *i* and iustly punish the obstinate.

[^11] *k* Christ shal reigne in his kingdome the Church.

[^12] *l* God the Father speaketh to *m* God the Sonne.

[^13] *n* Christ as man hath the Church for his inheritance. *o* Spred through the whole world.
