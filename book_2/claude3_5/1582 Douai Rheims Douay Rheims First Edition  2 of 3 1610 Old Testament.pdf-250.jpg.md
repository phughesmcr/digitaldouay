## PSALME. CXXXVII.

[^1]

To David him self.

[^2]

<sup>1</sup> I wil b confesse to thee ô Lord in my whole hart: *c* because thou hast heard the wordes of my mouth.

*c* God heareth the prayer that is rightly made, for which the supplicant is therfore to geue thankes.

In *d* the sight of Angels I wil sing to thee: <sup>2</sup> I wil adore toward thy holie temple, and wil confesse to thy name.

[^3]

For thy mercie, and thy truth: because thou hast magnified aboue euerie thing *f* thy holie name.

*f* The Name and Maiestie of GOD, The WORD (which is the Sonne of God) also, the name of IESVS, is magnified aboue al names, or temporal thinges:

<sup>3</sup> In what day soeuer I shal inuocate thee, heare me thou wilt multiplie strength in my soule.

<sup>4</sup> Let g al the kinges of the earth ô Lord confesse to thee: because they haue heard al the wordes of thy mouth:

[^4]

<sup>5</sup> And let them sing in the wayes of our Lord: because great is the glorie of our Lord.

<sup>6</sup> Because our Lord is high, and he beholdeth low thinges: and high thinges he knoweth *h* far of.

*h* God knoweth proud men, not as his freindes or seruants, but farre of, as strangers and enimies.

<sup>7</sup> If I shal walke in the middes of tribulation, thou wilt quicken me: and vpon the wrath of mine enimies thou hast extended thy hand, and thy right hand hath saued me.

<sup>8</sup> Our Lord wil repaye for me: ô Lord thy mercie is for euer: despise not the workes of thy handes.
