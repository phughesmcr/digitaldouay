decline from Catholic Religion, long torments, euen to death, except Gods seruants wil
relent, and denie the truth, which they assuredly beleue, and know in their conscience, that
they are bond to professe it.

<sup>7</sup> A thousand shal fal on thy syde, & ten thousand: on thy
righthand: but to thee it shal not approch.

[^1] On thy left side, in aduersitie manie fal from God, & on thy right side, in prosperitie manie
more forgett, and forsake God.

<sup>8</sup> But thou shalt consider with thine eies: and shalt see the retribution of sinners.

[^3] Angels haue protection of men by Gods ordinance. *o* The diuel corruptly alleageth this
scripture (Mat. 4.) omitting the latter part of this verse: which sheweth when Angels protect

not in geuing themselues headlong into needles danger, as the same diuel proposed to our
Sauiour, to cast himself downe from the pinnacle of the temple. Such falling is not the way of

[^4] God speaketh the rest that foloweth in this Psalme.

[^6] Foure sortes of persecution the faithful so fal from true Religion. Sometimes with torments euen to death, which the Catholi- ligion and obscure, which the Prophet here calleth feare in the night: when que faith. ignorant men are tempted by suggestion, or apprehension of temporal
1. afflictions, not knowing that they fal into eternal damnation, by flying from
2. worldlie, or bodilic calamities. Sometimes the tentation threatneth present
death to them that are wel instructed in the truth, and know that they must

day: when the faithful clerly seeth what danger hangeth ouer him, if he
