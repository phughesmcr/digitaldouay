OF PSALMES 195

<sup>14</sup> And they coueted concupiscence in the desert: and tempted God in the place without water.[^1]

<sup>15</sup> He gaue them their petition: and sent saturitie into their soules.

<sup>16</sup> And they prouoked Moyses in the campe: Aaron the *holie* of our Lord.[^2]

<sup>17</sup> The earth was opened, and swalowed Dathan: and ouerwhelmed the congregation of Abiron.

<sup>18</sup> And a fire flamed vp in their sinagogue: the flame burnt the sinners.

<sup>19</sup> And they made a calfe in Horeb: and they adored the sculptil.[^3]

<sup>20</sup> And they changed their glorie into the similitude of a calfe that eateth grasse.

<aside>God being their true glorie, they changed him, for a false god of the Ægyptians (who especially honored a calfe called Apis) making an image therof, and attributed their deliuerance from Ægypt to this imagined god. Exo. 32. v. 4. 8. Of which and the like idolish, and abominable idolatrie S. Paul writeth, Rom. 1 v. 23. They changed the glorie of the incorruptible God, into a similitude of the image of a corruptible man, and of foules, and of foure footed beastes, and of them that crepe: where we see what maner of imagies holie Scriptures condemne, and not the imagies of Christ and his Sainctes.</aside>

<sup>21</sup> They forgat God, which saued them, which did great thinges in Ægypt, <sup>22</sup> merueilous thinges in the land of Cham, terrible thinges in the Read sea.

<sup>23</sup> And he sayd to destroy them: if Moyses his elect had not stood in the way before him:[^4]

To turne away his wrath that he should not destroy them:

<sup>24</sup> and they estemed for naught the land that was to be desired.

<sup>25</sup> They did not beleue his word, <sup>26</sup> and they murmured in their tabernacles: they heard not the voice of our Lord.

<sup>27</sup> And he lifted vp his hand ouer them: to ouerthrow them in the desert:

<sup>28</sup> And to cast downe their seede among the Nations: and to disperse them in the countries.

<sup>29</sup> And they were professed to Beelphegor: and they did eate the sacrifices of the dead.[^5]

<aside>As God is the liuing God, that geueth life to others: so false goddes are called dead, that can not geue life to anie, but doe kill al that serue them; at least spiritually, and often corporally.</aside>

<sup>30</sup> And they prouoked him in their inuentions: and ruine was multiplied on them.

[^1]: According to their carnal desires.

[^2]: Holie by his function.

[^3]: They adored the image that represented a calf, not God.

[^4]: He sayd, he would destroy them, but for Moyses praier spared them.

[^5]: The Idol of Moabites, and Madianites.
