<sup>7</sup>For who in the cloudes shal be equal to our Lord: shal be like to God among the sonnes of God?

<sup>8</sup>God, who is glorified in the counsel of sainctes: great and terrible ouer al that are round about him.

<sup>9</sup>O Lord God of hoastes who is like to thee: thou art mightie ô Lord, and thy truth round about thee.

<sup>10</sup>Thou rulest ouer the powre of the sea: and the mouing of the waues therof thou doest mitigate.

<sup>11</sup>Thou *humbledst the proud one, as one wounded*: in the arme of thy strength thou hast dispersed thine enimies.

<sup>12</sup>The heauens are thine, and the earth is thine, the round earth, and the fulnes therof thou hast founded: <sup>13</sup>the north, and the sea thou hast created.

<sup>14</sup>Thabor and Hermon shal reioice in thy name: thy arme is with might.

Let *h* thy hand be confirmed, and thy *i* righthand exalted:

<sup>15</sup>Iustice and iudgement is the preparation of thy seat.

Mercie and truth shal goe before thy face: <sup>16</sup>blessed is the people that knoweth iubilation.

Lord they shal walke in the light of thy countinance, <sup>17</sup>and in thy name they shal reioyce al the day: and in thy iustice they shal be exalted.

<sup>18</sup>Because thou art the glorie of their strength: and in thy good pleasure shal our *l* horne be exalted.

<sup>19</sup>Because our protection is of our Lord: and of the holie one of Israel our king.

<sup>20</sup>Then didst thou speake in vision to thy sainctes, and saidst: I haue put helpe on the mightie one: and haue exalted an elect one of my people.

<sup>21</sup>I haue found Dauid my seruant: with myne holie oyle haue I anointed him.

<sup>22</sup>For mine hand shal helpe him: and myne arme shal strengthen him.

<sup>23</sup>The enimie shal nothing preuaile in him: and the sonne of iniquitie shal not adde to hurt him.

<sup>24</sup>And I wil cut downe his enimies before his face: and them that hate him I wil put to flight.
