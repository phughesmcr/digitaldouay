Behold

[^1]: Man haue sene, or know euen exactly how Christ came into this world, his conuersation therin, and his going forth: q his reigning now in heauen our Mediatour, by whom al other intercessers haue accesse to God.

[^2]: The Apostles sowing the first seede of Euangelical doctrin, / with whom other Apostolical men, t and other soules of al nations conuerted by their preaching, most ioyfully sing together in hart, voice, and instruments: especially in good workes, shew their grateful affections to our Redeemer.

[^3]: And al this in the particular Churches of diuers Kingdomes, and partes of the world: t beginning with the Israelites in Ierusalem, and so proceding into al Iurie, and Samaria, and to the vtmost of the earth. Act. 1.

[^4]: S. Paul of Iacobs youngest sonne Beniamin, last called to Apostleship, was chiefly sent to the Gentiles.

[^5]: As the Church begane by the omnipotent powre of God: so by the same only powre it is conserued.

[^6]: Chastice therfore ô God, al persecuters of thy Church, who are but as weake wauering reedes, in comparison of thy powre: b be better then bulles, wild kyne, that is, captaines and popular people, c endeuoring to alienate thy seruants from constant professed confession of their faith.

[^7]: A prophecie that manie should be conuerted to Christ in Ægypt, and Æthiopia: as appeareth by the innumerable multitude of religious Monkes, & Nunnes in those countries, shortly after the Apostles dayes.

<aside>Other Apostles of diuers tribes sent first to the Iewes, secondarily to Gentiles.</aside>

<aside>The like afterwards in al other nations, whom therfore the prophet inuiteth to praise God, for so inestimable benefites in the whole world.</aside>
