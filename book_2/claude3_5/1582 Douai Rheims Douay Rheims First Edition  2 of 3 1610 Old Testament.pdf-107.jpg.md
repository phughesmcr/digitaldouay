OF PSALMES. 107

PSALMI. LV.

*David being in danger before Achis king of Geth, confidently imploreth Davids prayer
Gods helpe, against the great malice and power of his enimies; 8. fore- in danger.
sheweth their ruine, his owne exaltation, 12. and offereth praises and the 3. key.
thankes.*

<aside>Vnto a the end, b for a people, that is made far from the
Sainctes, Dauid in c the inscription of the title, d when the
foreiners held him in Geth. (1. Reg. 21. v. 12.)</aside>

<aside>This Psalme perteyneth also to future times, b for the vse of anie iust persona, or people,
that are against their wil separated from the publike diuine Seruice of holie Church : c most
worthie to be noted with title, for perpetual memorie, d made by Dauid when the Philistims detected him to their king in Geth.</aside>

2 Have mercie on me ô God, because e man hath troden
vpon me: f al the day impugning he hath afflicted me.

<aside>Now one sorte of il disposed men, now an other, f neuer cease to seeke my destruction.</aside>

3 Myne enimies haue troden vpon me al the day : because they
are g manie that warre against me.

<aside>Saul with his great armie, the Philistimes, and other strangers, some in manifest hostilitie,
others detecting and betraing me to my aduersaries. So al that liue godly in Christ haue manie enimies visible and inuisible.</aside>

4 <sup>†</sup> From h the height of the day I shal feare : but I wil trust in
thee.

<aside>Of these most eminent great dangers I am in deede afeard, i but so that my trust and assured
confidence is in thee ô God.</aside>

5 In God I wil praise k my wordes, in God haue I hoped : I wil
not feare what flesh may do to me.

<aside>Wordes and promises made to me, or the good which I speake or do by Gods grace.</aside>

6 <sup>†</sup> Al the day did they l deteft my wordes; against me, m al
their cogitations are vnto euil.

<aside>They calumniate what soeuer I say, m al their wordes to euil sense.</aside>

7 <sup>†</sup> They wil n inhabite and keepe secret : they wil obserue
my heele.

<aside>They meete together, and secretly conspire to intrappe me or catch me tripping.</aside>

8 As they haue expected o my soule, p for nothing shalt thou
saue them : q in wrath thou wilt breake peoples.

<aside>to take my life: p for this their vaine purpose to destroy me, thou wilt saue them, as they
deserue, that is, q thou wilt breake them in peeces.</aside>

9 O God, r I haue shewed my life to thee : thou hast set my
teares in thy sight.

10 As also in thy promise : <sup>†</sup> then shal mine enemies be turned
backward.
