<sup>9</sup>Let thy Priests be clothed with justice: & let thy sainctes reioyce.

[^1] Grant therefore that thy Priests, which must offer sacrifice in this Sacred place, be indued with vertues, and good life worthie of their degree: and the Leuites who are ordained to serue there, be likewise made fitte for their diuers functions, both in the old and new Testament.

<sup>10</sup>For Dauid thy seruants sake, turne not away the face of thy Christ.

[^2] And seing thou hast geuen such meeknes, deuotion, zele, sinceritie, and other vertues making him a man according to thyne owne hart, and therupon promised to establish his sede, o differ not to send thy promised Messias, Christ our Redemer.

<sup>11</sup>Our Lord hath sworne truth to Dauid, and he wil not frustrate it: Of the fruite of thy wombe I wil set vpon thy seate.

[^3] Henceforth to the end of this Psalme, the Prophet relateth Gods reuelation to him: That he hath truly promised with an oath, p and wil performe, q to sette one of Dauids sonnes vpon his Throne: which was not only fulfilled in Salomon, who reigned in great peace, and builded the Temple, but especially in Christ the Sonne of Dauid, to whom our Lord God gaue the seate of Dauid his father, & he shal reigne in the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdom there shal be no end. Luc. 1. v. 32. 33. By this promise S. Peter also proueth Christs Resurrection. Act. 2. v. 30.

<sup>12</sup>If thy children shal keepe my testament, and these my testimonies which I wil teach them:

[^4] Concerning the children of Christ, members of his kingdom the Church, the promise is conditional, if they obserue Gods commandments, they shal sit vpon his seate: be coherres of his kingdom. Rom. 8. v. 17.

Their children also euen for euer, shal sit vpon thy seate.

<sup>13</sup>Because our Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for an habitation to himself.

<sup>14</sup>This is my rest for euer and euer: here wil I dwel because I haue chosen it.

<aside>Sion, the Catholique Church, is a perpetual place where God dwelleth.</aside>

<sup>15</sup>Blessing I wil blesse her widow: her poore I wil fil with breades.

[^5] The Church wanting Christs visible presence, is replenished with manie blessings, y and al her humble children are releeued with holie Sacraments.

<sup>16</sup>Her Priestes I wil clothe with saluation: and her sainctes shal reioyce with ioyfulnes.

<aside>The Church hath alwayes some holie Priestes, x and some holie people.</aside>

<sup>17</sup>Thither wil I bring forth a horne to Dauid, I haue prepared a lampe to my Christ.

[^6] Of this Church elected by God, Christ is the Protector, and strong defence: z and the same Church shal be a perpetual lampe, whereby others may come to him.

<sup>18</sup>His enemies I wil clothe with confusion: but vpon him shal my sanctification florish.
