<sup>5</sup>And he shal b continue with the sunne, and before the moone in generation and generation.

[^1] But only Christ, not Salomon, nor anie other king of that people, continueth, or reigneth for euer.

<sup>6</sup>He shal descend as rayne vpon a fleece : and as droppes distilling vpon the earth.

[^2] *The maner of Christs incarnation most silent, swete, and grateful.*

<sup>7</sup>There shal rise in his dayes iustice, and aboundance of peace, vntil the moone be taken away.

[^3] Agane the prophet inculcateth that Christs kingdom, his Church, shal continue for euer.

<sup>8</sup>And he shal rule from sea vnto sea : and from the riuer euen to the ends of the round world.

[^4] *The Church is not only vniuersal in al times, but also in places.*

<sup>9</sup>Before him shal the Ã†thiopians fal downe : and his enimies shal lick the earth.

<aside>Isai. 1.</aside>

<sup>10</sup>The kinges of Tharsis, and the Ilands shal offer presentes: the kinges of the Arabians, and of Saba shal bring giftes.

<aside>Mat. 2.</aside>

[^5] The three Sages or Kinges, which adored our Sauiour, and offered gold, frankencense, and myrrh, were the first that fulfilled this prophecie: and after wards Constantin the great, and other Emperors, Kinges, and Princes. Among other Ilandes great Brytannie (the greatest of Europe) was conuerted to Christ, according to this prophecie: first (some few in the Apostles time (Metaphrastes and Surius, Theodor. ep. ad Timoth. Sophron us, Ser. de Nat. Apost. & alij.) More in the time of Eleutherius. Lastly our English nation by S. Augustin and others sent by S. Gregorie.

<sup>11</sup>And al kinges of the earth shal adore him : al nations shal serue him.

<sup>12</sup>Because he shal deliuer the poore from the mightie : and the poore which had no helper.

<sup>13</sup>He shal spare the poore and needy: and he shal saue the soules of the poore.

<sup>14</sup>From vsuries and iniquitie he shal redeme their soules : and their name shal be honorable before him.

<sup>15</sup>And he shal liue, and there shal be giuen him of the gold of Arabia, and they shal adore it alwaies : al the day they shal blesse him.

[^6] How is this prophecie verified, except the Church be alwayes visible?

<sup>16</sup>And there shal be a firmament in the earth, in the toppes of mountaines, the fruite therof shal be extolled farre aboue Libanus: and they shal florish of the citie, as the grasse of the earth.

<sup>17</sup>Be his name blessed for euer : before the sunne his name is permanent.

And al the tribes of the earth shal be blessed in him : al nations shal magnifie him.
