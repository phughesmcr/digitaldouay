manie admirable and miraculous thinges donne amongst them; with their ingratitude, reiection, and reprobation.

[^1] The fifth principal key, and string is Christ, the promised Redemer of mankind: prophecying his Incarnation, Natiuitie, Trauels, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and Glorie. [^2] The sixe is the propagation of Christs name and Religion, with Sacrifice and Sacramntes, in the multitude of Gentiles beleeuing in him, euen to the vttermost coastes of the earth, the Catholique Church euer visible. [^3] The seuenth is the true maner of seruing God, with sincere faith, and good workes. [^4] The eight, holie Dauid interposeth manie thinges concerning himselfe. As Gods singular benefites towards him, for which he rendereth thankes, and diuine praises, recounteth his enimies, dangers, and afflictions of mind & bodie, namely by Saul, Absalon and others, humbly beseeking, and obtaining Gods protection. He also expresseth in himselfe a perfect image, and paterne of a sincere and hartie penitent: bewayling, confessing, and punishing his owne sinnes. [^5] The ninth is the end and renouation of this world, with the general Resurrection, and Iudgement. [^6] The tenth is eternal felicitie, and punishment, according as euerie one deserueth in this life. These are the tenne keyes of this holie Booke; and tenne stringes of this Diuine Psalter.

Moreouer to finde which of these is the proper key, and principal string of euerie Psalme, lerned Diuines vse foure especial wayes. [^7] First by the title, added by Esdras, or the seunetie two Interpreters, for an introduction to the sense of the same Psalme. So it appeareth that the third Psalme treateth literally of Dauids danger, and deliuerie from his sonne Absalon: which is the eight key, though mystically it signifieth Christs Persecution, Passion, & Resurrection, which is the fifth key. [^8] Secondly, if there be no title, or if it declare not sufficiently the key, or principal matter conteyned, it may some times be found by allegation and application

[^1]: Christs Redemer.

[^2]: Conuersion of Gentiles, the Catholique Church.

[^3]: Faith & good workes.

[^4]: Dauids owne actes.

[^5]: General Resurrection, & Iudgement.

[^6]: Eternal glory and paine.

[^7]: Foure wayes to finde the proper key of euerie psalme. 1. By the title.

[^8]: 2. Allegation in the new Testament.
