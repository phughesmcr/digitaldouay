# OF PSALMES.

S. Ambrose also moveth with like pietie, making two and twentie Sermons in exposition of this Psalme. Affirming in his Prologue, that amongst other Psalmes, especially this sheweth how great a master king David was of moral doctrine. For David as a moral doctor teaching of his owne nature twice, yet most this Psalme, delighteth the eares, and gently toucheth the minde, being uttered, as here is King David a Prophet with pleasantnes of verse, and sweetenes of tongue. Wherefore whereas this great master Royal Prophet in manie places of this booke, powrethout sentences of moral doctrine, or psalmes or songues, as bright starres, that shine and glister to al the world, here Athanasios excellently he produceth a more singular sunshot, as the sunne, of ful light, burning with meridian heate. And for the profite of al, the better to attaine to al Psalmes was that we would, he disposed this Psalme through al the Alphabet: that as composed in children beginning with the first letters, make entrance to further knowlege, order of the so by the same beginninges we should lay the first foundation, and therupon Alphabet. procede in our spiritual building, towards perfection in good life, the true service of God. Which is yet further insinuated (as the same Doctor teacheth) Why eight by the eight verses continually beginning with the same letter, and so other verses are eightin order through the whole Alphabet, to signifie that after seven dayes begynne with travel in this temporal life, we may come to that restie, which we expect in eternal life, the eight day of resurrection, when we hope to rise revived in our Lord Jesus, to reigne with him for ever.

Likewise S. Basil in the Argument of this Psalme admonisheth, that whereas holie David, according to divers states, which he passed, writte divers Psalmes: as when he fled from his enemies, when he lamented his distresses, S. Basile mourned in pensivenes, enjoyed peace and comforte, sanne a right course judgement of vertue, fel from God by sinne, & againe returning observed Gods lawes; in this his one Psalme he comprehendeth al his prayers made to God at sundrie times, Psalme containeth here proposeth the same, as a certaine profitable moral doctrine, to al sortes teacheth the and states of men. Neither doth he preternitte doctrinal pointes of faith, but argument interpreteth them also with moral documents, in such sorte, that this one of manie Psalmes may suffice to teach the wel disposed, how to attaine to perfection in Psalmes. vertue, to purge by the shameful vice diligent care of their soules, to recreate the desolate with spiritual consolations, & briefly it administereth al kindes of medicine, to the divers passions of mortal men.

For the like judgement of other Fathers we remitte the lerned reader, to Other expositors of this S. Hilarie, Theoderet, Prosper, Arnobius, Cassiodorus, Beda, Euthymius and Psalme. others, but can not wel omitte a briefe instruction of S. Ierom. Who in his Epistle to Paula Vrbica: not only sheweth the interpretation of the two and twentie letters, but also explicateth their sense in this place, by connecting them into certaine shorte sentences, in this maner.

Aleph.    Beth.    Gimel.    Daleth;
Doctrina. Domus.   Plenitudo. Tabularum;
Doctrine. Of the house. Fulnesse. Of tables;

S. Ieroms interpretation of the Hebrew Alphabet.

Which is the first connection, signifying that the doctrine of the house, that is, the Church of God, is found in the fulnes of divine bookes.

The second connection is:
He.    Vau.    Zain.    Heth.
Ista.    Et.    Haec.    Vita.
This thing. And.    This.    Life.

For what other life can there be without knowlege of Scriptures? whereby also Christ is knowen, who is the life of them that beleve in him.
