OF PSALMES. 57

I k haue gone round about, and haue immolated in his tabernacle an host of iubilation: I *l* wil sing, and say a Psalme to our Lord.[^1]

<aside>k Diligently recounting al thy benefits, I render thankes by sacrifices and praise.</aside>

<aside>l not only in hart, but also singing with loud voice and instrument.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> Heare ô Lord my voice, wherwith I haue cried to thee: haue mercie on me, and heare me.

<sup>8</sup> My m hart hath sayd to thee, my face hath sought thee out: n thy face ô Lord I wil seeke.[^2]

<sup>9</sup> Turne o not away thy face from me: p decline not in wrath from thy seruant.[^3]

Be q thou my helper: forsake me not, neither despise me ô God my Sauiour.[^4]

<sup>10</sup> Because r my father and my mother haue forsaken me: but our Lord hath taken me.[^5]

<sup>11</sup> Geue me *s* a law ô Lord in thy way: *t* and direct me in the right path, because of mine enemies.[^6]

<sup>12</sup> Deliuer me not into v the soules of them that truble me: because w vniust witnesses haue risen vp against me, and iniquity hath lyed x to it selfe.[^7]

<sup>13</sup> I y beleue to see the good things of our Lord, in the land of the liuing.[^8]

<sup>14</sup> *z* Expect our Lord, doe manfully: and a let thy hart take courage, and b expect thou our Lord.[^9]
