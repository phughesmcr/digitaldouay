OF PSALMES 205

<sup>2</sup> The workes of our Lord are great: exquisite according to al his willes.

<aside>Gods wil is the whole cause of al his workes.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Confession and magnificence his worke: and his iustice continueweth for euer and euer.

<aside>Euerie worke of his is praise worthie, and magnifical.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> He hath made a memorie of his meruelous workes; a merciful and pitiful Lord: <sup>5</sup> he hath geuen meate to them that feare him.

<aside>God hath left one most special and beneficial memorie of al other benefites, his owne bodie and bloud, in memorie of his Passion, and our redemption, the spiritual foode and sustinance of al the soules that rightly feare him.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> He wil be mindful for euer of his testament: <sup>h</sup> the force of his workes he wil shew forth to his people:

<aside>Of his promise to conserue his Church perpetually. h. the powrable operation of his death, and of al his mysteries.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> To geue them the inheritance of the gentiles: the workes of his handes truth, and iudgement.

<sup>8</sup> Al his commandmentes are faithful: confirmed for euer and euer, made in truth and equitie.

<sup>9</sup> He sent redemption to his people: he commanded his testament for euer.

<sup>10</sup> Holie, and terrible is his name: <sup>i</sup> the feare of our Lord is the beginning of wisedom.

<aside>Beginning with feare of God, bringeth at last by other degrees to true wisdom, which two are the first and last of the seuen giftes of the Holie Ghost.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Vnderstanding is good to al that doe it: his prayse remaineth for euer and euer.

[^1]: Gods commandments do iustifie al that kepe them.

[^2]: He also of his mercie redemed man, that he might be able to kepe his precepts.

PSALME CXI.

*True happines consisteth in fearing God, keping his commandments, 5. and in doing workes of mercie. 10. The contrarie bringeth to miserie.*

The meanes to be happie the 7. key.

Alleluia, *a* Of the returne of Aggeus, and Zacharie.

*a* The Seuentie Interpreters added this mention of Aggeus and Zacharie, returning from captiuitie, to signifie that this Psalme was very proper, & meete to be commended to the people at that time, whereby they might lerne, that their sinnes were the cause of their captiuitie, and of al their miseries: and if they desired temporal, or spiritual prosperitie, they must obserue the meanes here prescribed to obtayne the same.

<sup>1</sup> BLESSED is the man that feareth our Lord: *b* he shal haue great delight in his commandmentes.

<aside>He that sincerely feareth God, wil take great delight in keping his commandments.</aside>

[^3]: This Psalme is also composed by the Alphabet, as the next before.
