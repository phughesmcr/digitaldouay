## ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. IX.

[^1] After the 21. verse the late Hebrew Doctors divide this Psalme, beginning there the tenth, without anie new title: but only this word *sela*: Which the Seventie, Theodosion, and Symmachus translate *diapsalma*, that is, a change of meeter, or musike, also pause or rest in singing. Aquila with S. Ierom rather approueth, translateth *semper ever*. Some English Bibles omitte it, others leaue it in the text, not translating it into English. It semeth to most Interpreters to be added as a note to sturre vp attention. And it occureth often, not only in the end of Psalmes, but also in other places. For it is thrise in the third Psalme. And therefore maketh no argument, that this Psalme should be diuided. And those which diuide this into two, ioyne two in the 147. Psalme. So that al agree in the number of 150. Psalmes in the whole Psalter.

## PSALME X.

*Dauid feeming aduising him to flee from the persecution of Saul, he answereth, that his trust is in Gods protection. 2. Though the persecutor be very malitious, 4. yet God wil overthrow him, 5. and deliuer the iust.*

The 3. Key.

[^2] Vnto a the end the psalme of Dauid

<sup>1</sup> TRUST in our Lord: how say b ye to my soule: Passe ouer vnto the mountayne as a sparrow?

<sup>2</sup> For behold sinners c haue bent the bow, they haue prepared their arrowes in the quiuer, that they may shoote in d the darke, at them that be right of hart.

<sup>3</sup> For they haue e destroyed the thinges, which thou didst perfite: but the iust what hath he done?

<sup>4</sup> Our Lord is in his holie temple, our Lord his seate is in f heauen.

<sup>5</sup> His eies haue respect vnto the poore: his f eieliddes examine the sonnes of men.

<sup>6</sup> Our Lord g examineth the iust, and the impious: but he that h loueth iniquity, hateth his owne soule.

<sup>7</sup> He shal rayne snares vpon sinners: fyre and brimstone, and blast of stormes the portion of their cuppe.

[^1]: Some diuide this Psalme into two. Sela a note of change, or of rest in musike, or rather of attention. Al the Psalmes are iust 150.

[^2]: a S. Augustin applieth it to heretikes, persuading Catholikes to repare vnto their separate congregation, falsly calling it the mountayne.
