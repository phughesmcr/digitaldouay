## A BRIEFE NOTE CONCERNING the Gradual Psalmes.

[^1] Here folow in order fifteene Psalmes intitled Gradual Canticles. The Hebrew word Mahaloth signifieth Steppes, or Ascensions. The reason whereof Arias, and some other Rabbins yeld, for that they were songe with highest eleuated voice, that can be in Musike. The Talmud saith they are so called, because they were songe in the fifteene steppes going vp to the Temple But S. Augustine, S. Basil, and other Christian Fathers expound them according to the historie, and immediate propheticall sense, of the deliuerie of the Iewes from captiuitie of Babylon, ascending into Ierusalem: which is so framed on an other sense, that the way from it leadeth vnto it. According to the Mystical sense, of ascending spiritually by vertues to perfection, and eternal felicitie. For the way tending to vertue (saith S. Basil) is like to certaine steppes (or degrees) by litle and litle bringing the man that leaueth wisdome vnto heauen. These Canticles therefore are prayers, mixed with consolations, for the ioyful deliuerie of Gods people, from that great captiuitie in Babylon, which the Psalmist King Dauid saw in propheticall spirit, and which his posteritie felt, and sometime indured. Which againe more signifieth the redemption of mankind from sinne to grace, and from the miserable state of this world into heauen. Whereupon S. Augustin interpreteth them prophecie of the ascension, or eleuation of the iuste, from the vaile of teares. In the meane time, whiles we are in this world, these Psalmes are consolatorie prayers, and propheticall assurance, that Gods people, Catholique Christi an shal be deliuered from thraldom, and persecution of Paganes, Turkes, and Heretikes. As partly we see by the deliuerie from the Romane persecuting Emperors, from the Vandals, Gothes, and Hunnes: & therfore with assured confidence we hope and expect the like deliuerie from Turkes, and al Heretikes of Luthers broode.

*The Iewes in captiuitie of Babylon, Christians in persecution, or other great tribulation, pray with confidence to be deliuered from danger, and slander of wicked tongues, 5. lamenting their long indurance.*
