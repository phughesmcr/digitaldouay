THE BOOKE

<sup>3</sup>GOD save me in thy name : and in thy strength judge me.

<sup>4</sup>O God heare my prayer with thine eares: receive the words of my mouth.

<sup>5</sup>Because strangers have risen vp against me, & the strong have sought my soule: and they have not set God before their eies.

[^1]

<sup>6</sup>For behold God helpeth me: and our Lord is the receiver of my soule.

[^2]

<sup>7</sup>Turne away the evils to mine enimies: and in thy truth destroy them.

[^3]

<sup>8</sup>I wil voluntarily sacrifice to thee, and I wil confesse to thy name ô Lord, because it is good:

[^4]

<sup>9</sup>Because thou hast delivered me out of al tribulation: and mine eie hath looked downe vpon mine enimies.

[^5]

PSALME LIIII.

<aside>Gods providence towards the good and bad: they, key.</aside>

*The prophet (as wel in his owne, as other iust mens person) describeth great calamities suffered, 10. prayeth against the wicked, 13. lamenting especially that those which professe frendshipe, are adversaries: 17. and declareth Gods providence in protecting the good, and destroying the bad.*

<sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, in songes, vnderstanding to David.

[^6]

<sup>2</sup>HEARE my prayer ô God, despise not my petition.

<sup>3</sup>Attend to me, and heare me.

<sup>4</sup>I am made sorowful in my exercise: and am trubled at the voice of the enimie: and at the tribulation of the sinner.

[^7]

Because they have wrested iniquities vpon me: & in anger they were trublesome to me.

[^8]

<sup>5</sup>My hart is trubled in me: and the feare of death is falne vpon me.

[^9]

[^1]: Barbarous highland men have bestraide the place of myne abode to the persecuters.

[^2]: But I feare them not, because I am in Gods protection.

[^3]: A iust prayer, that God wil turne intended mischief, vpon the devisers heades, according to his promise, that he wil defend the innocent.

[^4]: Offering voluntarie sacrifice, more then is commanded: and praise thee ô God,

[^5]: as I am bond to reioyce in thy iust iudgements against the wicked.

[^6]: A song as wel for king David himselfe, as others of al times; to sing, and consider Gods providence, in suffering one man to afflict an other in this life.

[^7]: This life is a warfare, and a continual combate.

[^8]: calumniated me, and persecuted me by great furie.

[^9]: so inwardly afflicted, as if death were at hand.
