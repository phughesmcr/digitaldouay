THE BOOKE

[^1] My <sup>15</sup>bone is not hid from thee, which thou madest in a secret: and my substance in the lower partes of the earth.

[^2] Mine <sup>16</sup>imperfection thine eies haue sene, & in thy booke al shal be written: *m* daies shal be formed, & no man in them.

But to me <sup>17</sup>thy frendes ô God are become honorable exceedingly: their principalitie is exceedingly strengthned.

*n* Aboue al consideration it most excedeth, that God so high and infinite, honoreth his humble frends & fauoreth so excedingly, that it semeth to themselues, farre more then can be due for he rewardeth euen ouer & aboue merit, yea such merites also are granded in Gods mercie geuen without merite.

<sup>18</sup>I wil number them, and they shal be multiplied aboue the sand: *p* I rose vp and I am yet with thee.

*o* The number also of Saintes whom God hath chosen, called, iustified and wil glorifie, excede mans conceipt. *Apoc. 7. p* Inceased with this excellent glorie, and desiring to be of this innumerable multitude, by thy grace I haue risen from sinne, and in confidence of thy perpetual helpe, I stand and hope to perseuer in thy seruice.

<sup>19</sup>If thou shalt kil sinners ô God: *r* ye men of blood depart from me.

*q* And if it be so, yea (seing it is so, that as thou ô God doest exalt thy Sainctes, to exceding and vnspeakable honour: so thou hast also decreed to punish obstinate sinners, with eternal death and damnation: *r* I renounce al wicked association, geue ye away from me al cruel bloudie men, that would draw me into euerlasting torments.

<sup>20</sup>Because you say in thought: they shal receiue thy cities in vayne.

*s* Away from me, you that thinke, t the glorious mansions in heauen, prepared and promised to the iust, are vaine hopes, and in vaine expected.

<sup>21</sup>Did not I hate them, that hate thee ô Lord: and *w* pyned away because of thine enemies?

[^3] *x* with perfect hatred did I hate them: they are become <sup>22</sup>enemies to me.

*z* Proue me ô God, and know my hart: examine me, and <sup>23</sup>know my pathes.

And a see, if the way of iniquitie be in me: *b* and conduct <sup>24</sup>me in the euerlasting way.

[^1]: Or bones of mans bodie imperfection before his birth, *m* dayly formed by God, not by man.

[^2]: Neuer translated this place, translating [thoughts] for [frendes] contrary to the Hebrews, Greke, and Latin, and al ancient Fathers, only pretending that the same word in the Chaldee tongue also signifieth thoughts.

[^3]: This haue of such sinners the iust shal confidently plead, and happie are they that shal be able truly to allege for themselues in the day of iudgement, that they hated al, whom God hateth, *w* yea haue bene with feruent zele, that are Gods enimies.

<aside>*x* Stil the Prophet inculcateth this necessarie perfect hatred, *y* and enimitie towards Gods enimies.</aside>

<aside>*z* For that none in this life (without special and extraordinarie reuelation) knoweth certainly their owne state, whether they be worthie of Gods loue or hatred (Eccle. 9.) the iust submitte themselues to God, examination of their hart and actions:</aside>

<aside>*a* humbly praying God, that if they be in the way of iniquitie, *b* he wil vouchsafe to reduce and guid them into the right way of euerlasting life.</aside>
