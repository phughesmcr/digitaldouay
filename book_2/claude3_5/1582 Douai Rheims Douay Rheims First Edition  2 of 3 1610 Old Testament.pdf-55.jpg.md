ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XXV.

5. *I haue hated the Church of the malignant.*] Holie Dauid forced by reason of persecution to dwel amongst infidels his enemies, after he had twise spared king Saules life (1. Reg. 24. v. 5. c. 26. v. 9.) lamented (v. 1-9.) how great affliction it was to him, *to be cast out, that he could not dwel in the inheritance of our Lord* (where God was rightly serued) and that his enemies had done so much as in them lay, to make him fal into idolatrie, by their fact, as it were saying: *Goe*

[^1]: David in confidence of proceding, and zele against the wicked, alleageth his sincere more then ordinarie men may do, God so inspiring him extraordinarily:

[^2]: The rest of this Psalme professing, & protesting to serue God in his Church, euerie Priest reciteth in Masse, before he offer the holie Sacrifice, putting him selfe in memorie, that he must only communicate with the innocent, or of pure conscience: *f* and so approch to the Altar, *prefigured Leuit. 16. v. 4.*

[^3]: *f* I can not but singularly loue the excellencie of this place dedicated to thy seruice: where is true faith, vnitie, and charitie of thy people, the guard of holie Angels, the administration of sacred mysteries, assistance of the Holie Ghost, real presence of Christ our Lord, al replenished with Diuine maiestie. *k* This representeth vnto me the glorious heauenlie kingdom of God and al Sainctes.

[^4]: *Suffer me not therefore to be contaminate by the wicked, nor to be deuoured with them.*

[^5]: *stil readie to committe more and more iniquities. n themselves being corrupted, endeuour by giftes of worldly commodities to corrupt others.*

[^6]: *ought so to purge his conscience, that he may be innocent, or free from great sinne. p deliuer me from this necessitie of dwelling among the wicked.*

[^7]: *I intend to walke right. r I desire to praise thee amongst thy true faithful seruantes.*
