ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XXXIII.

1. *He changed his countenance* ] S. Augustin by holie Dauids changing of his countenance, and by changing the king of Geths his name, who in the booke of kinges (where the historie is recorded) is called Achis, and here Abimelech, gathereth that here is an hidden, and great Mysterie. Which he explicateth partly by interpretation of the Hebrew names, but more specially by Dauids changing of his countenance, which prefigured Christ, eternal God becoming man, and so making great changes in the world. For as Dauid killed Goliath, and for his good act gotte enuie, so Christ killing the diuel, and humilitie in the flesh merited killing pride, are persecuted by the wicked. For Christ was both to the ruine, and Resurrection of manie. He changed Sacrifice and Priesthood. The Iewes had sacrifice according to the order of Aaron, of oxen, sheepe, and this was in mysterie. For there was not then the Sacrifice of the bodie and bloud of our Lord: which the faithful, and those that haue read the Gospel do know: which Sacrifice is now spread in the round earth. A litle after: the Sacrifice of Aaron is taken away, and the Sacrifice according to the order of Melchisedech begane to be. He therfore, *I say not a man*, changed his countenance, Lest it may be, *I say not a man*, for our Lord Iesus Christ is knowen. He would haue our health to be in his bodie and bloud. From whence did he commend this bodie and bloud? From his humilitie. For vnles he were humble, he would neither be eaten nor drunke. Behold his highnes: In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and God the word. Loe the euerlasting meate, and Angels eate it, supernal powers eate it, celestial spirites eate it, and they eate, and are fatted, and the thing remaineth whole, which sattieth and reioyceth them. How then hath the wisdome of God fedde vs with the same bread, the word was made flesh and dwelt in vs? It were too long to recite this great Doctors whole discourse. He further sheweth that Christ dismissed the Iewes, and went from them to the Gentiles. Thus seeketh now Christ (saith he) among the Iewes, and findeth him not: because he had changed his countenance. For they thinking to haue sacrifice according to the order of Aaron, held not the Sacrifice according to the order of Melchisedech, and haue lost Christ: and the Gentiles haue begunne to haue him. Againe this holie father writeth very remarkably the words: When our Lord Iesus Christ spake of his bodie, he said: Vnles you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you shal not haue life in you. And because he had changed his countenance, this semed as furie, and madnes vnto them, to geue his flesh to be eaten of men, & his bloud to be drunke, therfore Dauid was reputed madde before Achis, when he said: You haue brought this madde man vnto me. Doth it not seme madnes: Eate ye my flesh, and drinke my bloud? He semed to be madde, thus S. Augustin. Neuer imagining the figuratiue interpretation of our new Sacramentaries: who say Christ gaue no more but a figure of his bodie & bloud, for then it had bene easily vnderstood by the Capharnaites, and no such contradiction, nor murmuring had happened. Yet S. Augustin saith more plainly, if more plaine may be. *Christ caried himself in his owne handes*. And how this can be done (saith he) in man, who can vnderstand? For who is caried in his owne handes? A man may be caried in the handes of others, no man is caried in his
