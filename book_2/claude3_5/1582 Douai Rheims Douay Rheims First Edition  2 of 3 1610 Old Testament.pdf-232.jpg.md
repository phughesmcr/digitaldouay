[^1] This religious institution reprehended by diverse Heretikes. Vigilantius. Wiclifists. Lutherans.

[^2] Approved by S. Beda. S. Gregorie. S. Augustin.

[^3] S. Ierom.

[^4] S. Basil.

[^5] S. Cyprian.

[^6] S. Clement.

[^7] Why publike prayer is continued at these houres.

[^8] Not lawful to go to Church, or to pray with Infidels.

[^9] Nor with Heretikes.

the part called Vigiles, or Nocturnes, certaine Heretikes repined, and extenuated the Churches custome, as superfluous and vnfruictful to spiritual worke, violating of Gods ordinance, who made the night for rest, and the day for laboure. For which cause they were called Nyctazantes, Somniculosi, Drowsy heretikes. As the same S. Isidorus testifieth li. 1. c. 21. de Offic. Eccles. S. Ierom Epist. ad Riparium, noteth the same heretike in Vigilantius, calling him Dormitantius, because he reprehended holie Vigiles, as if it were better to sleepe, then wake in time of Divine service. Wiclif also raised vp the same heresie, as witnesseth Thomas Waldensis. To. 3. Tit. 3. c. 21. Lastly Luther and al his broode. But the holie observation of Canonical Houres is proved, by manie ancient Fathers to be altogether agreable to the hol e Scriptures, both of the old and new Testament. So S. Beda. in 18. Luc. & li. 4. c. 7. Hist. Angl. S. Gregorie the Great li. 1. Dialog. c. 14. S. Augustin (ser. 57. de temp.) exhorting the people to rise early to the Vigiles (or Nocturnes) and in answere to some that said: We have no time (saith he) withdraw himselfe from the holie worke, but whom either sicknes, or publique vtilitie, or perhaps some great necessitie hindreth backe. S. Ierom. Epist. 21. ad Eustach. & in Epitaph. Paule c. 10. maketh expresse mention of the Third houre, Sixt, Ninth, Morning, and Evening; also of Midnight, adding that no Religious is ignorant that sometimes they must rise twice in the night to Divine service, twise, yea thrise in the night S. Basil, in Regulis fusius disput. ad interrog. 37. & de Instit. Monachorum. Sith therefore this observance to be so agreable to the holie Scriptures, and namely to this place of the Psalmist. S. Cyprian in fine exposit. Orat. Domini. affirmeth that besides the three houres in which Daniel prayed, and his folowers prayed, the Church of Christ hath added more. And (as manie suppose) S. Clement li. 8. Constit. Apostol c. 40. sheweth the sette Houres of prayers, and the reasons therof: Make your prayers Early in the morning, at the Third houre; Sixt, Ninth, Evening, and at the Time of cocke crowing. Early geuing thankes because our Lord hath illuminated vs, the night being past, & the day coming in: at the Third, because that houre our Lord receiued Pilats sentence: the Sixt houre, because then he was Crucified: the Ninth, because al thinges were moued, when our Lord was crucified, abhorring the audacitie of the wicked, & not bearing the ignominie of our Lord: at Evening, geuing thankes, for that God hath geuen vs the night for rest of dayes laboures: at the Cocke crowing, because that time the coming of the day is denounced, to exercise the workes of light, thus S. Clement. Touching the distinct and sette times of publique prayer, the continual practise of tradition teacheth, that Matines with Laudes were said in the night, about the first Cocke crowing. Prime early in the morning. The other partes in the day time: evening Evensong, and last of al Compline. And touching the place: If for the infidels (saith the same holie Father) there be no accesse to the Church, the Bishop must geather the Assemblie at home, that neither the godlie man not enter into the Church of the wicked: for the place doth not sanctifie man, but man the place. Wherfore if the wicked occupie the place, that place is to be shunned, because it is prophaned by them: for as Priestes do sanctifie holie thinges, so the wicked do contaminate them. If neither at home, nor in the Church Assemblies can be celebrated, let euerie one by himselfe sing, read, pray, or two or three be geathered together. For where two or three are geathered in my name (saith Christ) there am I, in the middes of them. Let not the godlie pray with an heretike, no not at home. *For what societie is there of light with darknes?*
