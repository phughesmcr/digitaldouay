<sup>6</sup> I have cried to thee o Lord, I have said: Thou art *my* hope, *my portion m* in the land of the living.

[^1] Thus self-destitute of al mans helpe, and destitute of al worldlie stuffe, I cried to thee ô Lord, my only, & special refuge, I neither do I desire to live for anie worldlie respect, but having chosen thee ô God for my portion, and inheritance, m I desire to be out of this desert place, and in the land, where al right & religious things flourish.

<sup>7</sup> Attend to my petition because I am humbled exceedingly.

Deliver me from them that persecute me: because they are made strong over me.

<sup>8</sup> Bring forth my soule out of prison, *o to confesse to thy name: p* the iust expect me, til thou reward me.

[^2] Davids desire of libertie, was especially to this end, that he might have convenient place, and others to serve and praise God: p the good, and wel disposed people of Israel, can not new serve thee as they desire, but expect me, q when thou ô Lord, wilt advance to the kingdom, that then we may serve thee, more freely and more commodiously.

[^3] S. Hilarie, Cassiodorus, Cassiodorus; and others expound the whole Psalme, Amongst others S. Beda briefly in these wordes. Whereas in the title, Vnderstanding is premised to Prayer, therby is signified, that David in his distresses, and in the denne whither he fled, vnderstood what our Lord should suffer of the Iewes, and how he would praye to his Father. In the first part our Lord crieth to his Father, complaining of the detestable deceites of Iudas the persecutor. In the second he prayeth to be delivered from the prison of hel (Limbus, where he was free) because the faith of al the Sainctes depended on his Resurrection.

PSALME CXLII.

<aside>King David in anie vehement spiritual or temporal tribulation, distrusting in his owne iustice, layeth open his calamitie, 5. considering Gods benignitie, 6. prayeth to be spedily delivered; 11. and confidently assureth himself therof.</aside>

[^4] A Psalme of David, when Absalom his sonne persecuted him: 1. 2. Reg. 17.

<sup>1</sup> LORD *b* heare my prayer: with thine eares receive my petition in *a* thy truth: heare me in *thy iustice*.

<sup>2</sup> And c enter not into iudgement with thy servant: *d* because no man living shal be iustified in thy sight.

[^5] Deale not with me in rigour of iustice, d for no mortal man is able of himself to be iustified; abstaining from Gods mercie.

<sup>3</sup> Because the enemie *e* hath persecuted my soule: he *f* hath humbled my life in the earth.

*e* sought my life, *f* and brought it into great danger. Spiritually, the divel as a roring lion stil seeking whom he may devoure vehemently.

<sup>4</sup> He hath set me in obscure places as the dead of the world: and my spirit is in anguish vpon me, within me my hart is trubled.

*g I am pressed with great calamitie, temporal or spiritual.*
