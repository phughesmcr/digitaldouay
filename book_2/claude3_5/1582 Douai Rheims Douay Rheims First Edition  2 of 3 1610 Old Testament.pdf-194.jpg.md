Alleluia.

[^1]<sup>1</sup>Confesse ye to our Lord because he is good: because his mercie is for euer.

<sup>2</sup>Who shal speake the powers of our Lord, shal make al his praises to be heard?

[^2]<sup>3</sup>Blessed are they, that keepe iudgement, and doe iustice at al time.

[^3]<sup>4</sup>Remember vs O Lord in the good pleasure of thy people: visite vs in thy saluation:

<sup>5</sup>To see in the goodnes of thyne elect, to reioyce in the ioy of thy nation: that thou maist be praysed with thine inheritance.

[^4]<sup>6</sup>We haue sinned with our fathers: we haue dealt vniustly, we haue done iniquitie.

[^5]<sup>7</sup>Our fathers in Ã†gypt did not vnderstand thy meruelous workes: they were not mindeful of the multitude of thy mercie.

And they prouoked thee to wrath going vp vnto the sea, the Read sea.

<sup>8</sup>And he saued them for his name sake; that he might make his power knowen:

[^6]<sup>9</sup>And he rebuked the Read sea, and it was made drie: and he led them in the depths as in a desert.

<sup>10</sup>And he saued them from the hand of them that hated them: and " he redemed them out of the hand of the enemie.

<sup>11</sup>And water ouerwhelmed those that afflicted them: there did not one of them remaine.

<sup>12</sup>And they beleued his wordes: and they sang his praise.

<sup>13</sup>They had quickly donne, they forgot his workes: and they expected not his counsel.

[^1]: God is of himselfe and essentially good. Also his goodnes is participared of him.

[^2]: No creature can fully expresse Gods perfections.

[^3]: It is a happie state in this life, either to kepe Gods law: or to repent and do worthie penance for transgressions.

[^4]: According to thy wonted beneuolence, promised to thy people.

[^5]: That we may see, and enioy the benefites promised to thyne elect.

[^6]: We haue erred and hurt ourselues: we haue wronged our neighbours: we haue offended against God.
