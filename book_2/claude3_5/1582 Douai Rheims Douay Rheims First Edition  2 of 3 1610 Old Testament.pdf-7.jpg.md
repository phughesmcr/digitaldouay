UPON THE PSALMES. 7

was none before, and prophecied victorie against the enemies. Reason also and experience teach, that as *men of cheerful hart are apt to sing*: so the exercise of reading, singing, or playing Psalmes, is a convenient and a special meanes, to attaine quietnes or cheerfulnes of mind.

But as this holie Psalter is the key of other Scriptures, so it selfe is most especially a sealed, and locked Booke, requiring manie keyes. *Euerie Psalme* (saith S. Hilarie) *hath a peculiar key, and oftentimes there be so manie lockes and keyes of one Psalme, as there be diuers persons that speake, to diuers endes and purposes*.

The first key, or string, is God himself: One in Substance: Three in Persons. Almightie, Alperfect, Powre, Wisdom, Goodnes, Maiestie, Iustice, Mercie, & other Diuine Attributes. The second, is Gods workes of Creation, Conseruation, and Gouerning of the whole world. The third, Gods Prouidence, especially towards man, in protecting and rewarding the iust: in permitting, and punishing the wicked. The fourth, is the peculiar calling of the Hebrew people, their beginning in Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: their maruelous increase in Ã†gypt: diuers estates, manie
