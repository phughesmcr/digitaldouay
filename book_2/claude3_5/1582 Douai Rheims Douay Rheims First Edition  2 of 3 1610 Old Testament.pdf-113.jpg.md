<sup>9</sup> Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim the strength of my heade.

<sup>10</sup> Iuda my king: Moab the pot of my hope.[^1]

Into Edom wil I stretch out my shoe: the foreiners are sub iect to me.[^2]

<sup>11</sup> Who shal conduct me into a fensed citie? who shal conduct me euen into Idumea?

<sup>12</sup> Shal not thou ô God, that hast expelled vs: and wilt not thou ô God goe forth in our hostes?[^3]

<sup>13</sup> Giue vs aide from tribulation: because mans saluation is vaine.

<sup>14</sup> In God we shal doe strength: and he shal bring to nothing them that afflict vs.[^4]
