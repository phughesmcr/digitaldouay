OF PSALMES 141

<sup>4</sup> My soule refused to be comforted, I was mindeful of God, and was delighted, and was exercised: and my spirite fainted.

<aside>I was sometimes in such anguish that nothing semed comfortable, but I relied vpon God so firmly, that my former comfort came to an extasie, or rauance.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Myne eies preuented the watches: I was trubled, & spake not.

<aside>I arose early before the ordinarie time of awayking, I my hart being attentiue invvardly, I vttered nothing vvith my tongue.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> I thought vpon old daies: and the eternal yeares I had in minde.

<sup>7</sup> And I meditated in the night with my hart, and I was exercised, and I swept my spirite.

[^1]

<sup>8</sup> Why, wil God reiect for euer: or wil he not adde to be better pleased as yet?

[^2]

<sup>9</sup> Or wil he cutte of his mercie for euer, from generation vnto generation?

<sup>10</sup> Or wil God forget to haue mercie? or wil he in his wrath keepe in his mercies?

<sup>11</sup> And I sayde: Now haue I begune: this is the change of the right hand of the Highest.

[^3]

<sup>12</sup> I haue bene mindful of the workes of our Lord: because I wil be mindful, from the beginning of thy meruelous workes.

<sup>13</sup> And I wil meditate in al thy workes: and in thy inuentions I wil be exercised.

<sup>14</sup> O God in the holie is thy way: what God is great as our God?

<sup>15</sup> thou art the God that doest meruelous thinges.

<sup>16</sup> Thou hast made thy powre knowne among peoples: thou hast with thine arme redemed thy people, the children of Iacob, and Ioseph.

[^4]

<sup>17</sup> The waters saw thee ô God, the waters saw thee: and they were afrayd, and the depthes were trubled.

[^5]

[^1]: *I diligently examined my conscience.*

[^2]: Assuredly God wil not reiect for euer, but he wil be pleased with his Church.

[^3]: Whiles I thus thought, I erred greatly, now I see and confesse that God suffereth al calamities for the good of his seruantes: p and this I knew not by my selfe, but by the inspiration of God, making this change in me by his gracious hand.

[^4]: The progenie of Iacob, receiued and nourished in Ægypt for Iosephs sake, as his adopted children.

[^5]: The read sea, and Iordan felt thy diuine powre, and obeyed thy wil.
