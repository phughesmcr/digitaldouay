OF PSALMES. 79

<sup>1</sup>Vnto *a* the end, to *b* Idithun him selfe, a canticle of Dauid. *a* Some expound this Psalme of the Iewes in captiuitie in Babylon, but this title, and the matter conteyned shew, that it rather pertaineth to the new Testament, *b* to be songe by Idithun and his scholares & successors, or rather by Christians.

<sup>2</sup>I HAVE said: I wil keepe my waies: that I offend not in my tongue.[^1]

I haue set a gard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.

<sup>3</sup>I was dumme and humbled, and kept silence *d* from good thinges: and *e* my sorrow was renewed.[^2]

<sup>4</sup>My *f* hart waxed hote within me: and in my meditation a fyre shal burne.[^3]

<sup>5</sup>I haue spoken in my tongue: Lord make mine end knowne to me.[^4]

And the number of my daies what it is: that I may know what is lacking to me.

<sup>6</sup>Behold thou hast put my daies measurable, and my *h* substance is as nothing before thee.[^5]

Doubtles al things are vanitie, euerie man liuing.

<sup>7</sup>Surely man passeth as *i* an image; yea and he is trubled *k* in vayne.[^6]

He gathereth treasures: and knoweth not to whom he shal gather them.

<sup>8</sup>And now what is my expectation? is not our Lord? and my substance is with thee.

<sup>9</sup>From al mine iniquities deliuer me: *l* a reproch to the foolish thou hast geuen me.[^7]

<sup>10</sup>I was dumme, and opened not my mouth, *m* because thou *n* didst it: <sup>11</sup>Remoue thy scourges from me.[^8]

<sup>12</sup>By the strength of thy hand I haue faynted in reprehensions: for iniquitie thou hast chastised man.

And thou hast made his *o* soule pyne away as a spider: but vaynly is euerie man trubled.[^9]

[^1]: in affliction not able to deliuer them selues, seeke reuenge, by murmuring and other sinnes, but the perfect resolue to rule their tongues:

[^2]: *d* euen to forbeare some *e* though thereby they indure more persecution.

[^3]: *f* sorow suppressed maketh the hart to burne with zele, and indignation.

[^4]: please thee let me know how long I shal liue, desiring to dye, as Elias desired. 3. Reg. 19.

[^5]: *h* my life and al that I haue is as nothing compared to thy eternitie.

[^6]: *i* as a shadow *k* therefore or image appearing in a glasse, which is quickly forgotte. there is no cause man should be trubled in mind for temporal miseries.

[^7]: *l* Thou hast suffered me to be reproched by the foolish that prosper in this world:

[^8]: *m* because thou *n* I know my tribulation is by thy prouidence.

[^9]: *o* my life decayeth as a spider leauing litle al her moysture.
