<sup>8</sup> Because our Lord is just and hath loved justice: his countenance hath seene equitie.

<sup>1</sup> Unto the end for the octave, the Psalme of David.[^a]

<sup>2</sup> SAVE me Lord, because the holy hath fayled: because verities are diminished from the children of men.[^d]

<sup>3</sup> They have spoken vaine thinges everie one to his neighbour, deceitful lippes, they have spoken in hart and hart.

<sup>4</sup> Our Lord destroy al deceitful lippes, & the tongue that speaketh great thinges[^f]

<sup>5</sup> Which have said: We wil magnifie our tongue, our lippes are of vs: who is our Lord?

<sup>8</sup> Thou Lord wilt preserve us from this generation for ever.[^h]

<sup>9</sup> The impious walke round about: according to thy highnes thou hast multiplied the children of men.[^i]
