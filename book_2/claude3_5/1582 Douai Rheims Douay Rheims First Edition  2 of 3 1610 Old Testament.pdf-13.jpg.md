VPON THE PSALMES.

tion, yet stil the greater part is in Psalmes. Certayne also of the same Psalmes, are without change, or intermission repeted euerie day. And such as haue obligation to the Canonical Houres, must at least read the whole Office priuatly, if they be not present where it is song. The Office also of Masse, ordinarily beginneth with a Psalme. In Litanies, and almost al publique Prayers, and in administration of other Sacraments, and Sacramentals, either whole Psalmes, or frequent verses are inserted. Likewise the greatest part of the Offices, of our B. Ladie, and for the dead are Psalmes. Besides the seuen PÅ“nitential, and fiftene Gradual Psalmes, at certaine times. So that Clergie mens daily office consisteth much in singing, or reading Psalmes. And therfore al Byshops especially, are strictly bond by a particular Canon (*Dist. 38. cap. Omnes psallentes*) to be skilful in the Psalmes of Dauid: and to see that other Clergie men be wel instructed therin. According to the Holie Ghosts admonition, by the pen of the same Royal Prophet (*Psal 46.*) *Psallite sapienter*; or: *intelligenter*, that is, *Sing Psalmes with knowledge, and vnderstanding them*. Not that euerie one is bond to know, and be able to dissolue al difficulties, but competently, according to their charge vndertaken in Gods Church. Otherwise euerie one that is, or intendeth to be a Priest, may remember what God denounceth to him, by the Prophet Osee (*c. 4.*) *Because thou hast repelled knowledge, I wil repel thee, that thou do not the function of Priesthood vnto me*. Thus much touching the Author, the contentes, the poetical stile, & final cause of this holie Psalter.

As for the name, S. Ierom; S. Augustin, and other Fathers teach, that wheras amongst innumerable musical instruments, six were more specially vsed in Dauids time, mentioned by him in the last Psalme: *Trumpet, Psalter, Harpe Timbre*, *Organ, and Cimbal*. This booke hath his name of the instrument called Psalter, which hath tenne strings, signifying the tenne commandements, and is made in
