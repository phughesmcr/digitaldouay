OF PSALMES 203

<sup>26</sup> Helpe me ô Lord my God: *l*, save me according to thy mercie.

<sup>27</sup> And let them know that this is thy hand: and thou ô Lord hast done it.

<sup>28</sup> They wil curse, and thou shalt blesse: let them that rise up against me, be confounded: but thy servant shal rejoyce.

<sup>29</sup> Let them that detract from me, be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their confusion, as with a duble patched cloke.[^1]

<sup>30</sup> I wil confesse to our Lord excedingly with my mouth: and in the middes of manie I wil prayse him:

<sup>31</sup> Because he hath stood on the righthand of the poore, that he might save my soule from the persecutors.

*4. with the Priesthood of Melchisedechs order to the end of the world. the 3. key.*
*6. and shal iudge the world.*

<sup>1</sup> A psalme of David.

OVR a Lord sayd b to my Lord: Sitte on my right hand: c til I make thine enemies, thy footestoole of thy f eete.[^2]

Although not the same, but exclueded al time, wherein the enimie might imagine, that Christs kingdom should cease: signifying that Christ shal reigne til al his enemies be subdued, much more afterwards in al eternitie.

<sup>2</sup> Our Lord wil send forth the rod of thy strength d from al Sion: rule thou in the middes of thine enemies.[^3]

<sup>3</sup> With thee e the beginning in the day f of thy strength, in the brightnes of holie thinges: from the wombe h before the day starre I begat thee.[^4]

<sup>4</sup> Our Lord i sware, and it shal not repent him: Thou art a Priest k for ever according to l the order of Melchisedech.[^5]

[^1]: With al possible confusion.

[^2]: a God the Father. b To God the Sonne, the Lord of David; and of al mankind, yet the sonne of David, according to his humanitie.

[^3]: d The Church of Christ beginning in Ierusalem on whitsunday, the fiftith day from his Resurrection, continueth ever more.

[^4]: e Thou shalt have principalitie, f in the day of thy powerful conquest, and rising from death. g in excellencie of al holie (spiritual) mysteries and graces: h because, i God the Father of my substance begat thee, God the Sonne in eternitie. The same which Micheas saith (c. 5. v. 2.) His coming forth from the beginning, from the dayes of eternitie.

[^5]: i God most firmly, and vnchangeably affirmed: that thou (Christ our Messias) art not only a King, but also a Priest: k not for a time, as Aaron was, but for ever, l neither of Aarons order, but according to the Order of Melchisedec.
