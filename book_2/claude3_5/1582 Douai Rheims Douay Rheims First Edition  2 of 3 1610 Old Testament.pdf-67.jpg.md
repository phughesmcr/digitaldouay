OF PSALMES. 67

whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.[^1]

<sup>13</sup> Our Lord hath looked from heaven: he hath sene al the children of men.[^2]

<sup>14</sup> From his prepared habitation he hath looked vpon al, that inhabite the earth.

<sup>15</sup> Who made their hartes seuerally: who vnderstandeth al their workes.[^3]

<sup>16</sup> The king is not saued by much powre: and the gyant shal not be saued in the multitude of his strength.[^4]

<sup>17</sup> The horse fayleth to safetie, and in the abundance of his force he shal not be saued.[^5]

<sup>18</sup> Behold the eies of our Lord be vpon them that feare him: and on them, that hope vpon his mercie.

<sup>19</sup> That he may deliuer their soules from death: and nourish them in famine.

<sup>20</sup> Our soule expecteth our Lord: because he is our helper and protector.

<sup>21</sup> Because in him our hart shal reioyce: and we haue trusted in his holie name.

<sup>22</sup> Let thy mercie Ã´ Lord be made vpon vs: as we haue hoped in thee.[^6]
