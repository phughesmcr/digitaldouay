OF PSALMES 237

<sup>2</sup> Behold as the eies of seruantes, are on the handes of their masters,

<aside>Seruantes expecting necessaries at their masters handes, are commonly very attentiue to receiue that which they hope for: so must the faithful praying God, be very attentiue, and not distracted in their prayers.</aside>

As the eies of the handmaide on the handes of her mistresse: so are our eies to our Lord God vntil he haue mercie on vs.

<aside>An other example of handmaides, who generally are more diligent then men.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Haue mercie on vs O Lord, haue mercie on vs: because we are much replenished with contempt.

<aside>Though God suffer his seruantes to sustaine some affliction and reproch, yet he heareth and deliuereth them before they be oppressed.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Because our soule is much replenished: reproch to them that abund, and contempt to the prowde.

<aside>Seing persecution stil increase, or continue r long, the faithful are then specially to conceaue hope of speedie reliefe.</aside>

PSALME. CXXIII.

*The whole Church, and euerie iust person, gratfully confesseth, that by Gods protection they are secure, without which none could escape ruine.*[^1]

1 A gradual Canticle.

<sup>2</sup> BVt that our Lord was in vs, let Israel now say: but that our Lord was in vs,

<sup>3</sup> When men rose vp against vs, perhaps they had swalowed vs aliue:[^2]

when their furie was angrie against vs, <sup>4</sup> perhaps water had swalowed vs.

<sup>5</sup> Our soule hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soule had passed through an intolerable water.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be our Lord which hath not geuen vs, for a pray to their teeth.

<sup>7</sup> Our soule as a sparow is deliuered from the snare of the fowlers:

The snare is broken, and we are deliuered.

<sup>8</sup> Our helpe is in the name of our Lord, who made heauen and earth.

[^1]: Gods protection. the 3. key:

[^2]: If God had not sent his helpe, and defence to vs, we could not haue escaped the force of our enimies. The word [perhaps] doth not here import a doubt, or vncertaintie, but in modest maner of asseueration, leaueth the iudgement of the cause that should happen (if God did not protect his seruantes) to their owne consideration: which is an vsual phrase in most languages. So suddenly should the weake, without Gods protection, be deuoured, as some are drowned & swallowed vp by rauening wild beasts, euen before they be throughly dead. So vvas Ionas swallowed into the whales bellie.
