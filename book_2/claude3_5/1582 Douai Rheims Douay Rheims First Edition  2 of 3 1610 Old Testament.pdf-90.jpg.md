<sup>15</sup>And the daughters of Tyre with giftes, al the rich of the people shal beseech thy countenance.

[^1]

<sup>14</sup>Al the glorie of that daughter of the king is within, in borders of gold <sup>15</sup>clothed round about with varieties.

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XLIIII.

[^4]

[^5]

[^1]: Manie of al nations submitte themselues, and al that they haue to Christ.

[^2]: As Apostles came in place of Patriarches and Prophetes: so stil Bishops, and Priestes succede in the Church, pastors, and gouernours therof.

[^3]: These pastors shal stil teach the true Christian doctrin.

[^4]: 7. Thy seate o God for euer and euer] Seing S. Paul (Heb. 1. v. 8.) affirmeth expressly that these wordes are spoken of the Sonne of God, Christ our Sauiour, thereby proueth his excellencie aboue Angels: Iohn Caluin is wonderful bold to auouch that in the simple & proper sense, Dauid spake of his sonne Salomon, and the daughter of Pharao, as if that were the literal sense. But first only expounded mystically. For first the solemne preface in the two first verses importeth farre greater thinges, then agree to anie terrestrial king. Secondly, that excellent beautie described (v. 3.) aboue the sonnes of men, can not be verified of Salomon, for Absalom (2. Reg. 14. 25.) and Adonias were also very beautiful. (3. Reg. 1. v. 6.) As for Salomons wisdom, or other vertues, he perseuered not therin, and for he was not blessed for euer. Thirdly, the prophet here calleth the person of whom, and to whom he speaketh, God v. 7. & 8. Fourthly, not only the ancient Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, but also the Hebrew Rabbins, and the Chaldee paraphrast, expound this Psalme literally of the promised Messias, and his kingdom the Church.

[^5]: No saluation out of the Church.
