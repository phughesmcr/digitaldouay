<sup>5</sup> As with marrow and fatness let my soule be filled: *k* and 6
my mouth shal praise with lippes of exultation.

[^1] <sup>7</sup> If I haue bene mindful of thee vpon my bedde, *m* in the
morning I wil meditate on thee: <sup>8</sup> because thou hast bene
my helper.

[^2] <sup>9</sup> And in the couert of thy winges I wil reioice, my soule hath
cleaued after thee: thy right hand hath receiued me.

<sup>10</sup> But *n* they in vaine haue sought my soule, *o* they shal enter
into the inferiour partes of the earth.

[^3] <sup>11</sup> They *p* shal be deliuered into the handes of the sworde,
they shal be *q* the portions of foxes.

[^4] <sup>12</sup> But *r* the king shal reioice in God, al shal be praised that
sweare by him: because the mouth is stopped of those that
speake wicked thinges.

PSALME. LXIII.

*A confident prayer in tribulation.*

*The 7. key.*

Vnto the end, a Psalme of Dauid.

<sup>1</sup> HEARE ô God my prayer when I make petition: from the 2
feare of my enimie deliuer my soule.

<sup>3</sup> Thou *a* hast protected me from the *b* assemblie of the malignant: from the multitude of them that worke iniquitie.

[^5] <sup>4</sup> Because they haue sharpned their tongues as a sworde: they
haue bent the bow a bitter thing, <sup>5</sup> that they may shoote in
secretes at the immaculate.

<sup>6</sup> Sodanely they wil shoote at him, and wil not feare: they
*c* haue confirmed to themselues a wicked worde.

<aside>They are resolued to intrap me.</aside>

They haue talked to hide snares: they haue saide, who shal see
them?

[^1]: Replenish my soul ô God, with the aboundance of thy grace, & so shal I be more able to praise thee.

[^2]: Being in the night, also in my bed I meditate of thee; *m* I wil more diligently do the same in the morning.

[^3]: My temporal and spiritual enimies: *o* and they shal be damned for their sinnes.

[^4]: It happened literally to Saul, that he was slaine in battle, which he made against his enimies; *q* and his dead bodie was hung on a wall (1. Reg. 31.) exposed to wilde beasts, or birdes, though it was afterwards burnt and buried.

[^5]: By example of thy former protection, *b* from the conspiracie of wicked men, I trust most assuredly in thy helpe.
