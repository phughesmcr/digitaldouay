OF PSALMES. 21

musike, or had authoritie ouer other musitians: or to him, whose office was to phrase, to the sing victories and triumphes. But the Latin, according to the Greeke, hath *in medio thefiles them*, *Psalmi ipsi*, which (most commonly signifying perpetuitie, or continuance vnto the end of anie thing) in the titles of the Psalmes rather signifieth, that the matter conteyned in the Psalme, perteineth to future times, or persons, especially to the new Testament. And so S. Augustine expoudeth it here of Christ, who is *the end* (or perfection) *of the law*. Neither doth this mystical sense exclude the Church, and faithful people, whom the Prophete here exhorteth to haue confidence in God, and consolation in their afflictions, & patience in tribulation, which is the seuenth key, proposing his owne example, & prophetically Christs. The same wherto Christ exhorteth, saying: Ioan. 16. v. vlt. *Haue confidence I haue ouercome the world*. Signifying that his seruantes, through his grace, may also ouercome it.

6. *Sacrifice of iustice.*) Not only external Sacrifice of diuers kindes, were necessary in the law of nature, and of Moyses, and one most excellent and compliment of al, in the new Testament, but also spiritual sacrifices are euer, and is necessarie, required, and that of three sortes. First, Sacrifice of Contrition, or of a contrite hart (Psal. 50.) *An afflicted spirit is a sacrifice to God*. The second is sacrifice of Iustice, here mentioned. The third is Sacrifice of praise (Psal 49.) *Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise*. Concerning the second proposed in this place: He Praise, offereth sacrifice of Iustice, that rendereth to euery one that is due. First to God as our Creator, a resignation of our selues, euen our liues and substance pleasing to him: as to our Master, we must render faith and beleefe, in al that he proposeth; as to our Father, hope, confidence, & reuerential feare; as to our Lord and King, payment of tribute, that is obseruation of his law and commandments; as to our Captaine, the trauail of warfare in this life; as to our Phisitian, patience and toleration, when he permitteth our tentations, for iustice; as to our Spouse, chastity of body and mind, fleeing al carnal and spiritual fornication; as to our Freind, frequent conuersation in adtes of deuotion. We owe to our selues, that being we consist of soule and bodie, we keepe due subordination, that the soule and reason command, & the bodie, and inferiour appetite obey, as the seruant must obey his master, and the handmaide her mistris. We owe to our neighbour, loue from the hart, instruction also from the mouth, and assistance by our helpe, according to his necessitie, and our abilitie; yea though our neighbour be our enemie. But to other enemies contrary thinges are due. To the world, contempt: because the goodes of this world are smal, few, short, vncertaine, deceitful, not satisfying the mind, and mixed with manie euils and dangers: To the flesh we owe chastisement, and daylie care, to tame it, that it serue the soule, & rebel not. To the diuel we must render the shame, that he fell by pride, acknowledging our faultes, and al truthes, and so returne vpon him al vanitie and lying, wherwith he allureth & seduceth. Finally to sinne it selfe, we owe hate, and reuenge, because it is the only euil, that hurteth vs, and due punishment with zele of iustice, because it dishonoreth God. He that thus offereth *sacrifice of iustice*, may iustly (as it foloweth in the Psalme) hope (yea assure him selfe) in our Lord. And lest anie should pretend ignorance, saying: *who sheweth vs good thinges*? as though they lacked instruction, the Prophete preueteth this vaine excuse, saying: *The light of thy countenance* O Lord (the light of reason, which is the image of God, wherto we are created like) *is signed vpon vs*, fixed in our vnderstanding, that we may see there is a God, that ought to be serued, and that he wil reward his seruants.[^1]

[^1]: Light of reason sheweth there is a God that rewardeth.
