<sup>18</sup> Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel, who only doth meruelous thinges. [^1]

<sup>19</sup> And blessed be the name of his maiestie for euer: and al the earth shal be filled with his maiestie. Be it, be it.

<aside>About al other desires the holie prophet wished Gods glorie, and praises in al the earth, as it is in heauen.</aside>

<sup>20</sup> The praises of Dauid, the sonne of Iesse are ended.

<aside>It semeth by this appendix added by Esdras, that this Psalme was last composed, though not put in the last place, but as it came to his handes. Dauid the natural sonne of Iesse, made no more Hymnes, that is, no more musical praises of God after this Psalme, but the prefigured Dauid Christ our Sauiour, the Sonne of God, in his bodie the Church, singeth his new praises. S. Aug. in enarrat. Psal. sequentis. 72.</aside>

PSALME. LXXII.

*The royal prophet, first professing the vnspeakable goodnes of God, 2. in the person of the weake complaineth, that the wicked prosper, and the iust are afflicted. 15. reprehendeth the murmuration, for though we can not comprehend the secrete iudgements of God. 18. yet they are most iust. 23. So with desire to rest in God, he promiseth euer to praise him.*

[^2]

1 A Psalme *a* to Asaph.

*a* To be songe by Asaph the master of musicke, and his companie.

How *b* good is God to Israel, to them, that are of a right hart?

*b* God is so excellent good, as no tongue can expresse, no hart can conceiue.

<sup>2</sup> But my feete were almost moued, my steppes almost slipped.

<aside>The peace and prosperitie of the wicked tempted me, to leaue the right narrow way, and to goe the brode easie way with them.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Because I haue had zele vpon the wicked, seing the peace of sinners.

<sup>4</sup> Because there is *d* no respect to their death: and *e* stabilitie in ther plague.

*d* They neuer thinke of death; *e* and if they suffer some affliction, they quickly remoue it from them.

<sup>5</sup> In *f* the labours of men they are not, and with men they shal not be scourged.

*f* They trauail not so much as good men do, neither are they so often punished.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore *g* hath pride helde them, they are couered with their iniquitie and impietie.

*g* Which maketh them proud, and so they runne into al sortes of iniquitie.

[^1]: No miracles can be donne but by Gods powre.

[^2]: Affliction in this world is recompensed in the end. the. 9. key.
