# OF PSALMES.

## ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. III.

1. *Psalme of David.*] Al Interpreters agreably teach, that king Dauid made not the titles, which are before the Psalmes. Neuertheles they are authentical, as endited by the Holie Ghost. And it is most probable Esdras added those titles which are in the Hebrew: and the Seuentie interpreters wrote the other, in their Greke Edition. Both which S. Ierom translated into Latin.

In these titles fiue thinges may be noted. First, the former two hauing no title at al, the general name of Psalme, common to al, is particularly appropriated to some, and other names to others. Which al are wont to write: Psalme Inscription, Prayer, Canticle, Psalme of Canticle, Canticle of Psalme, Hymne, Testimonie, Vnderstanding, Praise of Canticle, Alleluia, & Gradual Canticle.

Secondly, in the titles of some Psalmes are the names of certaine persons, which by S. Augustins iudgement, cited in the Proemial Annotations, and others, procure not the same persons to be authores of those Psalmes, but signifieth some other thing. Thirdly, in some titles the time is signified, when the Psalme was made, or song. Fourthly, the matter conteined in the Psalme, or vpon what occasion it was made, is expressed in some titles. Fiftly diuers other termes are often vsed in the titles of sundrie Psalmes, as *To the end. For the Octaue. For presses*, and the like, al which we shal briefly explicate, where they first occurre.

First therfore this third Psalme is called *the psalme of Dauid*, not because he is author therof, for he is author of al the Psalmes, whose name is not expressed, as is euident by the testimonie of al the Apostles. *Act. 4. v. 25*. but because it treateth particularly and literally of him.

1. *When he fled from the face of Absalom.*] Here the time is signified, when this Psalme was made, to witte, immediatly after the ouerthrow of his rebellious sonne Absalom, mentioned. *2. Reg. 15*. & before his returne to Ierusalem. For al beit of humane, natural, and fatherly affection, he greatly lamented the death of his sonne, yet he rendered thankes and praises to God, as reason and dutie bond him.

2. *I haue slept, and haue beene at rest, and haue risen vp.*] King Dauid by his sleeping in persecution, and by his resting, and deliuerie from his persecuters, prefigured Christs Death, Burial, & Resurrection. As appeareth, Ioan. 2. v. 22. Where the Euangelist saith: *this meaned he of the temple of his bodie*. But did not the scripture, to witte, this and other like prophecies. For otherwise the old Testament doth not so expresly declare such Mysteries, as the Gospel doth: but signifieth the proper, and grammatical signification of the wordes, and an other thing, in shadowes and figures, and both literal. Wherevpon S. Gregory teacheth (*li. 20. c. 1. Moral.*) that holie Scripture (amongst other incomparable excellences) surpasseth al other doctrines, in the verie maner of speaking: because by one and the same speach, it reporteth a thing donne, and proclaimeth a Mysterie: so relating thinges past, that with the verie same wordes, it foresheweth thinges to come.
