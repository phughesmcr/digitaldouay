<sup>8</sup> All mine enemies whispered against me : they did thinke euils to me:

<sup>9</sup> They haue determined an vniust word against me : / Shal not he that sleepeth adde to ryse againe?

[^3]: o As before in respect of sinners, Christ Iudge of al wil render to euerie one: so here in his owne person he auoucheth his owne innocencie, which made him apt to satisfie for others.

[^4]: p For this mercie of Almightie God in sauing the elect by his Sonnes death, he is to be praised for euer eternally. q Al the blessed agree in this, that God is eternally to be praised and therto say Amen. So be it, so be it.

<aside>The sonnes of Core repented, and departed from their fathers sch sme, and so escaped miraculously the horrible pitte of damnation, into which their father and his complices fel. Num. 26. v 10 By which example al seduced, and deceiued Christians are admonished, not to persist in schisme or other sinnes. And worldlie men are warned to desire & seke God aboue al thinges, first of al the kingdome of heauen (to be liuing members of the Catholique Church) and the iustice therof: to seke thinges which are aboue, not which are vpon the earth, lest hel deuoure them, as it deuoured the complices of Core Num 16.</aside>
