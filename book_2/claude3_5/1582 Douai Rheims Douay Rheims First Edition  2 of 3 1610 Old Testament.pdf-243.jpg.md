PSALME CXXXI.

*The psalmist earnestly prayeth God to geue him leaue, & to shew him where, to build a Temple. But more especially prayeth for, and prophecieth the coming of Christ, the promised Sonne of Dauid, 14. signifying Gods promises therof, and of establishing his Church.*

1 A gradual Canticle.

REMEMBER a Dauid Ã´ Lord, and al his meekenes:

<aside>a It is an vsual thing that Dauid, Moyses, & other Prophetes speake of themselues in the third person.</aside>

2 As he <sup>2</sup>sware to our Lord, b vowed a vowe to the God of Iacob.

<aside>b King Dauid desiring, and so farre as lay in him, promising to build a Temple to God, with great instance prayed that he might performe the same. But God disposing otherwise, that not he, but his sonne should build it, he neuertheles prepared the matter, workemen, and money, the royal site, and al disposed the Leuites how to serue therin.</aside>

3 <sup>3</sup>c If I shal enter into the tabernacle of my house, if I shal ascend into the bed of my couch.

<aside>c Moreouer by vow depriued himself of entering into his owne house, or taking his ordinarie rest, til he might (if it so pleased God) know the place where it should be built.</aside>

4 <sup>4</sup>If I shal geue sleepe to mine eies, and slumbering to mine eie liddes:

5 <sup>5</sup>And rest to my temples: vntil I finde a place for our Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Iacob.

6 <sup>6</sup>Behold we haue heard of it d in Ephrata: we haue found it in e the fildes of the wood.

<aside>d It was reueiled to Dauid, that the Temple should be built, in that part of Ierusalem, which looketh towards Bethlehem (otherwise called Ephrata) where our Sauiour was borne.</aside>

<aside>e Within Ierusalem, which is compassed with woodes. In this vision also the whole forme of the Temple was reueiled vnto him, as he testifieth, 1. Par. 28. v. 19. Al thinges, quoth he, came written with the hand of our Lord vnto me: that I might vnderstand al the workes of the paterne.</aside>

7 <sup>7</sup>f We wil enter into his tabernacle: we wil g adore in the place where his feete stood.

<aside>f Holie Dauid moued with exceding deuotion, repared to the place, where Gods Temple should be built, g & adored God, where his Propitiatorie, as a footstoole representing Gods presence, should stand. What mened then ye deuout mourne Christians, to visite the holie places, where our Sauiour, God and Man was Incarnate, was borne, suffered death, was buried, ascended into heauen, or anie other place where his feete stood.</aside>

8 <sup>8</sup>h Arise Lord into thy rest, thou and i the arke of thy sanctification.

<aside>h O God, leauing Silo, Gabaon, and the like places, come into thy holie Temple. i With the Arke of couenant, where thou sanctifiest thy people. And here againe the Prophet illuminated with a higher Mysterie, and inflamed with more deuotion, prayeth for Christes coming into the world, and that after his Passion he wil rise, not only in glorie of soule, but also of bodie, prefigured by the Arke of testimonie, which was in the tabernacle, and after in the Temple.</aside>
