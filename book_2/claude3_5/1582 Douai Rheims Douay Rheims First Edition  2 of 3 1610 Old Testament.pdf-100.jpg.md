<sup>8</sup> For behold thou hast loved truth: *n* the uncertaine, and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.

[^1] Besides thou hast also geuen me knowledge of true faith, and right doctrine, which thou euer louest, and art accustomed to reueale, and direct such into the true way of penance.

<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt sprinkle me with *o* hyssope, and I shal be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shal be made *p* whiter then snow.

[^2] Most merciful Lord thou wilt (as I see in the spirit of prophecie) sprinkle me, and al men with thy bloud, from the Crosse, where they shal geue thee vinegre about hyssoppe to drinke. (Ioan. 19.) By which washing I shal be cleane from sinne, and become in time pure, yea whiter then snow. A figure of this hyssope was obserued in Moyses Law. Num. 19. signifying the lustie bloud of Christ infinite charitie.

<sup>10</sup> To *q* my hearing thou shalt geue ioy and gladnes, and *r* the bones humbled shal reioyce.

<aside>When my affections shal be cleane purged, I shal take singular great delight to heare of thee, & and al my powers of mind and bodie, which are now afflicted, shal reioyce.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Turne away thy face from my sinnes: and wipe away al mine iniquities.

[^3] I craue not cogitation of punishing, to which purpose first take away my iniquities, for otherwise if they remaine, Gods iustice can not but punish them.

<sup>12</sup> Create a cleane hart in me ô God: and renew a right spirit in my *u* bowels.

[^4] Create in me new grace, wherby my hart shal be pure. So S. Paul calleth a iust soul a new creature. Galat. 6. v. 15. *In my inward thoughtes.*

<sup>13</sup> Cast me not away from thy face: and thy Holie Spirit *w* take not from me.

<aside>suffer me not so to fal againe, that thy grace depart from me.</aside>

<sup>14</sup> Render vnto me *x* the ioy of thy saluation: and *y* confirme me with the principal spirit,

[^5] which I had before my fal, of Christ promised of my seede, and alter not the same for my sinnes. Dauid also and other penitents pray here, that God wil restore vnto them the ioy, which they had in the state of grace, of eternal saluation promised, & confirme & conserue in me hereafter, a strong, constant, and willing spirit to perseruere.

<sup>15</sup> I *z* wil teach the vniust thy waies: and the impious shal be conuerted to thee.

[^6] No way can a penitent better shew himself grateful to God, for remission of his sinnes, then by instructing, exhorting, and perswading other sinners to repentance, to leaue their former il wayes, and turne to God.

<sup>16</sup> Deliuer me *a* from bloudes ô God, the God of my saluation: and my tongue shal exult [for] thy iustice.

[^7] From guilt and punishment of murder, causing Vrias and others with him to be slaine. Other penitents pray to be deliuered from what sinnes soeuer they haue committed, by sheding
