Heare vs Ã´ God our sauiour, the hope of al the ends of the
earth; and in the sea farre.

<sup>7</sup> Preparing mountanes in thy strength; girded with might: 8
which troublest the depths of the sea, the sound of the waues
therof.

[^1] The Gentiles shal / be trubled, and they that inhabite the 9
borders shal be affraid of thy signes: *m* the outegoings of
the morning and euening thou shalt delight.

multiplied to inrich it.
The *n* riuer of God is replenished with waters, thou hast prepared their *o* meat: because *p* so is the preparation therof.

[^3] Inebriate *q* her riuers, *r* multiplie her fruites : in her 11
dropps she shal reioyce springing.

[^4] Thou *s* wilt / blesse the crowne of the yeare of thy goodnes: 12
*t* and thy fildes shal be replenished with plentie.

*w* litle hilles shal be girded about with exultation.

<sup>14</sup> The rammes of the shepe are clothed, and *y* the valleis shal
abounde with corne: *z* they wil crie, yea they wil say an
hyme.
