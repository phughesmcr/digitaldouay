OF PSALMES. 189

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast put on a confession and beautie: being clothed with light as with a garment:

<aside>a Thou possessest al maiestie, and matter of praise.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Stretching out the heauen as a skinne: which couerest the higher partes thereof with waters.

<aside>b Thou hast compassed the sphere of the fixed starres, with a sphere of christalline substance which is as water congealed.</aside>

which c makest the cloude for thee to ascend on: which walkest vpon the winges of windes.

<aside>c According to our capacitie the prophet describeth the speedie coming, or working of God as if he came in a swift cloud, or with winges of the wind, to signifie that he worketh when and when he pleaseth without delay. He saith, and thinges were made: he commanded and they were created, Psal. 32.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Which makest spirits thine Angels: and thy c ministers a burning fyre.

<aside>d Thy messengers to execute thy wil: & the same Angels are as a burning fire in operatiue yet they dispatch more easily, and more speedily then we can conceiue.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Which hast founded the earth vpon f the stabilitie thereof: it shal not be inclined for euer and euer:

<aside>E Most firmly established by natural weight, in the center of the world.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> The g depth, h as a garment, is his clothing: vpon the mountaines shal waters stand.

<aside>g The water h should naturally couer al the earth:</aside>

<sup>7</sup> At i thy reprehension they shal flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shal feare.

<aside>i But by thy commandment the waters are conteined in their limited places.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> The k mountaines ascend: and the plaine fildes descend into the place, which thou hast founded for them.

<aside>k The waters being conueyed in their appointed chanels, both hilles and fieldes appere which otherwise would be couered.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast set a bound, which l they shal not passe ouer: neither shal they returne to couer the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Which sendest forth fontaines in the valles: betwen the middest of mountaines shal waters passe.

<sup>11</sup> Al the beastes of the filde shal drinke: the wilde asses shal expect in their thirst.

<aside>m hope for and receiue</aside>

<sup>12</sup> Ouer them shal the foules of the ayre inhabite: out of the middes of rockes they shal geue forth voices.

<sup>13</sup> Watering the mountaines from his higher places: of the fruite of thy worke shal the earth be filled:

<sup>14</sup> Bringing forth grasse for beastes, and herbe for the seruice of men.
