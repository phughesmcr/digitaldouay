THE BOOKE

<sup>14</sup> And he conducted them in a cloude by day: and al the night by light of fire.

[^1]

<sup>15</sup> He stroke the rocke in the desert: and gaue them water to drinke as in a great depth.

[^2]

<sup>16</sup> And he broughtforth water out of the rocke: and made waters runne downe as riuers.

<sup>17</sup> And they added as yet to sinne vnto him: they prouoked the Highest to wrath in the place without water.

<aside>Which naturally wanted water: but by miracle had abundance.</aside>

<sup>18</sup> And they tempted God in their hartes: so that they asked meats for their liues.

<aside>Not content with Manna, they demanded to haue flesh.</aside>

<sup>19</sup> And they spake euil of God: they saide: Can God prepare a table in the desert?

<aside>Stil incredulous, not beleeuing Gods omnipotecie, they thought that, albeit he had geuen them manna, and water, yet he could not geue them flesh.</aside>

<sup>20</sup> Because he stroke the rocke and waters ranne, & torrentes flowed:

Can he also giue bread, or prepare a table for his people?

[^3]

<sup>21</sup> Therfore our Lord heard, and made delay: and fire was kindled in Iacob, and wrath ascended vpon Israel.

[^4]

<sup>22</sup> Because they beleued not in God, nor hoped in his saluation.

<sup>23</sup> And he commanded the cloudes from aboue, and opened the gates of heauen.

<sup>24</sup> And he rayned them Manna to eate, and bread of heauen he gaue to them.

<sup>25</sup> Bread of Angels did man eate: he sent them victuals in abundance.

<aside>Manna made by Angels.</aside>

<sup>26</sup> He transported the Southwinde from heauen: and in his powre he brought in the Southwestwinde.
