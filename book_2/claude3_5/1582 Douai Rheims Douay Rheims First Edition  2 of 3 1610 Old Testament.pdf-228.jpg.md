<sup>115</sup>Depart from me ye malignant: and I wil search the commandmentes of my God.

[^1]: Whosoever wil seriously and securely search the law of God, must auoide the conuersation of euil men.

<sup>116</sup>Receive me according to thy *word*, and I shal liue: and confound me not in myn expectation.

[^2]: A general and very fitte prayer, when we addid ourselues by a firme resolution to serue God, beseching him to receiue vs into his protection: whereby spiritual life is conserued: which we pray with great confidence, because he hath promised to heare those that seeke, aske, and knocke at the dore of his grace.

<sup>117</sup>Helpe me, and I shal be saued: and I wil meditate in thy iustifications alwayes.

[^3]: We must pray also that he suffer vs not to be confounded, or made frustrate of the reward which we expect; for hope confoundeth not, if charitie be powred in our hartes, by the Holie Ghost, which is geuen vs. Rom. 5. v.5.

<sup>118</sup>Thou hast despised al that reuolt from thy iudgementes: because their cogitation is vniust.

[^4]: God reiecteth sinners: so long as they thinke peruersly: that is, vntil by his grace, some returne to a better mind, which of themselues they can not do.

<sup>119</sup>Al the sinners of the earth I haue reputed preuaricatours: therfore haue I loued thy testimonies.

[^5]: As God accounteth al sinners, so the iust also esteemeth them, conforming his iudgement to Gods.

<sup>120</sup>Pearce my flesh with thy feare: for I am afrayd of thy iudgementes.

[^6]: Seruil feare is profitable as this place maketh euident: though perfect charitie afterwards succeding, expelleth that feare, and moueth to do wel for the loue of God, not for feare of punishment. 1.Ioan. 4.

Ain. A fountaine, or an eye.

<sup>121</sup>I haue done iudgement and iustice: deliuer me not to them that calumniate me.

<aside>The iust againe in feruent zele, not arrogantly, but confidently professing his innocencie, prayeth to be defended from calumniators.</aside>

<sup>122</sup>Receiue thy seruant vnto good: let not the prowde calumniate me.

[^7]: Grant therfore Ã´ God the good, and lawful request which I demand.

<sup>123</sup>Mine eies haue fayled after thy saluation: and for the *word* of thy iustice.

[^8]: By long expecting to be deliuered, and saued from tribulation.

<sup>124</sup>Doe with thy seruant according to thy mercie: and teachet me thy iustifications.

<sup>125</sup>I am thy seruant: geue me vnderstanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
