OF PSALMES. 149

PSALME LXXVIII.

*The Prophet, in person of the Church, lamenteth the crueltie of persecutors The Church suffereth verie (both in the old and new testament) 1. prayeth for release, with iust great perse-*
*reuenge against Gods enemies, that blaspheme his name, 3. and promiseth cutions.*
*to be grateful in diuine praises.*

1 A Psalme *a* to Asaph.
2 *to be soung by Asaph and his companie, in the behalfe of people vnited in faith.*

O God *b* the Gentiles are come into thine inheritance,
they *c* haue polluted thy holie temple: they haue made
Ierusalem *d* as a watchtowre of fruite.

<aside>b Cruel infidels haue inuaded, spoile th places, which perteyne to thy Church: c euen possessed and prophaned the holie temple of the Iewes, and Churches of Catholique Christians. Fulfilled by Antiochus, in Ierusalem: by the Vandals in Afrike, by Protestants, and Puritanes, in diuers partes of Europe, and wil be more vniuersally by Antichrist in al Christendom. d In stead of great and faire Churches, Gods seruantes are faine to vse meane houses, yea poore cotages.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> They haue made *e* the carcasses of thy seruants, meats for
the foules of the aire: the flesh of thy sainctes for the beastes
of the land.

[^1]: e Some persecutors suffer not Martyrs bodies to be buried, but hang them on poles, and pinacles, where birdes may eate them.

<sup>3</sup> They haue poured out their bloude as water round about
Ierusalem: and there was none to burie them.

<sup>4</sup> We are *f* become a reproch to our neighboures: a scorne
and mocke to them that are round about vs:

[^2]: f Christianes Galileans, Catholiques Homousians, and now Papistes, in spite and reproch.

<sup>5</sup> How long Ã´ Lord, wilt thou *g* be angrie for euer: shal thy
zele be kindled as a fire?

[^3]: g Sinnes prouoking Gods wrath, are the cause why he suffereth his people to be persecuted.

<sup>6</sup> Poure out thy wrath vpon the Gentiles, that haue not
knowne thee: & vpon the kingdomes, that haue not inuocated
thy name.

[^4]: h Though the faithful committe some sinnes, yet in respect that they belieue rightly, haue zele in Gods cause, and denie not God, they are neerer to grace and fauour.
