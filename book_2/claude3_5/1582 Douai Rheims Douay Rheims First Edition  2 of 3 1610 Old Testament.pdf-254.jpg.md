# THE BOOKE

[^1] But as for the just, they shal confesse to thy name: and the righteous shal dwel with thy countenance.

## PSALME CXL.

[^2] *The Church prayeth that her children may auoide sinful wordes, & not make excuse of sinnes committed, nor communicate with others in sinne, nor to heare flatterers: & but to pray that they may amend. (The Psalmist by the way prophecieth that manie shal be conuerted) & though sometimes persecution be great, the Church faileth not.*

A Psalme of Dauid.

<sup>1</sup> LORD I haue cried to thee, heare me : attend to my voice, when I shal crie to thee.

<sup>2</sup> Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight : the eleuation of my handes as b euening sacrifice.

<sup>3</sup> Set Ã´ Lord c a watch to my mouth: and d a doore round about my lippes.

<sup>4</sup> Decline not my hart e into wordes of malice, to make excuses in sinnes.

With men that worke iniquitie : and I wil not communicate with the chiefe of them.

<sup>5</sup> The iust shal rebuke me in mercie, and f shal reprehend me: the oyle of a sinner g fatte my head.

<sup>6</sup> Because, h yet also my prayer is in their i good pleasures : k their iudges are swalowed vp ioyned to the rocke.

<sup>7</sup> They shal heare my wordes m because they haue preuailed : n as the grossenes of the earth is broken out vpon the earth.

[^1]: Eternal glorie consisteth in seeing God.

[^2]: The Church prayeth and preuaileth. Isa. 6. key.

[^3]: In these wordes the Church prayeth, offering incense in her solemne Offices.

<aside>a As the fume of incense is sweet and ascendeth vpwards: so the Church prayeth that her petitions may be grateful, and ascend to God. b In the old testament morning sacrifice was rather more solemne, and more frequent, but the Prophet seemeth to allude vnto Christes Sacrifice, which he was to offer towards euening on the Crosse: and the same also in vnbloudie maner, the euening before his Passion, in the Eucharist.</aside>

<aside>c A iust care and consideration, what to speake, before the mouth be opened. d lippes must not be alwayes stopt, for it is sometimes necessarie to speake, but as a dore that is to be opened, and shut at due seasons, for a mans owne good conscience, and Gods truth:</aside>

<aside>e ibute from f Decline not my hart into wordes of malice, to make excuses in sinnes.</aside>

<aside>f Admonition of the iust, is a profitable reprehension, g but the fawning of flatterers is pernicious.</aside>

<aside>h The Church ceaseth not to pray for sinners, i though as yet they take pleasure in their sinnes, k but the very chiefest of them, which seeme most potent, if they remaine obstinate to their death, shal then perish, as men throwne against rockes.</aside>

<aside>l They shal then heare and vnderstand, that the prayers of the Church m are effectual, n obtaining grace of constancie to her children, not to feare anie persecution, nor anie kind of death;</aside>
