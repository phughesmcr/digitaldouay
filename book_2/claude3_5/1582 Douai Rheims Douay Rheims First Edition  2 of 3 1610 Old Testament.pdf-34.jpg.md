PSALME. XIIII.

*For attayning eternal glorie in heauen, it is necessarie to flee from sinnes, and do good workes.*

**The Psalme: of Dauid.**

<sup>1</sup> LORD who shal dwel in a thy tabernacle? or who shal rest in thy holie hil?

<sup>2</sup> He that walketh b without spot, and c worketh iustice:

<sup>3</sup> He that speaketh truth in his d hart, that hath not done guile in his e tongue. Nor hath f done euil to his neighbour, and hath not taken g reproch against his neighbours,

<sup>4</sup> The malignant is brought to nothing in his sight; but them that feare our Lord, he h glorifieth: he that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiueth not,

<sup>5</sup> i that hath not geuen his money to k vsurie, and hath not taken l giftes vpon the innocent:

He that doeth these thinges, shal not be moued for euer.

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XIIII.

1. The Psalmes of Dauid] As the appropriating of the general name of Psalmes vnto forme, doth not preiudice, but that the rest are also Psalmes, though they be called Praiers, Canticles, Testimonies, and the like: so the application of Dauids name to certaine Psalmes, is no preiudice to other authores of the rest. But the name of Psalm sheweth a spiritual songe, apt for musical instrument; and the name of Dauid by interpretation signifieth, that it particularly pertaineth to the blessed.

[^1] Why this and certaine others are called the Psalmes of Dauid.

[^2] Both faith and good workes are necessarie to saluation.

[^3] a In heauen, as appeareth by the last verse.

[^4] b One requisite thing is to be free, or cleansed from sinne. c the second is to do good.

[^5] d Sincerely in thought,

[^6] e word, and

[^7] f dede: g nor harkened to detraction.

[^8] h Glorie is the reward of good workes.

[^9] i Vsurie excluded from heauen.

[^10] k Likewise doing wrong for bribes.

<aside>exceth with grace.</aside>

<aside>Venial sinnes exclude not from heauen. Good workes done in mortal sinnes are Ino. to saluation.</aside>

<aside>Of eternal Beatitude. The 10. key.</aside>
