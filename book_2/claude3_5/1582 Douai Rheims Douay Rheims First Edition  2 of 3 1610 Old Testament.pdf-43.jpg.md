wherein he perpetually dwelleth. g Christ the bridgrome, and the Church his bride are neuer diuorced; his loue, wisdome, and powre, euer conseruing her by his immaculate law.

<aside>Luc. 24.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> He hath reioyced as a giant to runne the way, his comming forth from the toppe of heauen: And his recourse euen to the toppe therof: neither is there that can hide him selfe from his heate.

<aside>Mat. 17. Mar. 13.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> The law of our Lord is immaculate *h* conuerting soules: the testimonie of our Lord is faithful, geuing wisedome to litle ones.[^1]

<sup>9</sup> The iustices of our Lord be right, making hartes ioyful: the precept of our Lord lightsome; illuminating the eies.

<sup>10</sup> The feare of our Lord is holie, permanent for euer and euer: the iudgementes of our Lord be true, iustified in themselues.

<sup>11</sup> To be desired aboue gold and much pretious stone: and more sweete aboue honie and the honie combe.

<aside>Mat. 27. Mar. 15.</aside>

<sup>12</sup> For thy seruant keepeth them; in keeping them is *k* much reward.[^2]

<sup>13</sup> Sinnes who vnderstandeth: from my secrete sinnes cleanse me: <sup>14</sup> and from other mens spare thy seruant.[^3]

If *m* they shal not haue dominion ouer me, then shal I be immaculate; and shal be cleansed from the greatest sinne.[^4]

<sup>15</sup> And the wordes of my mouth shal be such as may please: and the meditation of my hart in thy sight alwayes.

O Lord *n* my helper, and my *o* redeemer.[^5]
