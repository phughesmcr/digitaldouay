# THE BOOKE

[^1] <sup>11</sup> I will declare thy name to my brethren ] Here it is evident that this Psalme is of Christ, not of David, by S. Pauls allegation (*Heb. 2. v. 11.12.*) saying : He that sanctifieth (to wit Christ) disdained not to cal the sanctified his bretheren.

<sup>23</sup> In the middle of the Church I will praise thee ] After Christs Passion and Resurrection, in the rest of this Psalme, other two principal pointes of Christian Religion are likewise prophecied : His perpetual visible Church, and the B. Sacrament of his bodie. The former is here prophecied by way of inviting *al the seede of Iacob to glorifie God, and al the seede of Israel to feare him* (v. 25.) to wit, innumerable Christians the true Israelites, the universal Church in the whole world. For the heretical partes, or parcels in the world, such as the Donatistes, which going forth from the Catholique Church say : Christ hath lost his great Church, the divel hath taken the whole world from him, and he remaineth only in a part of Africa, they do not praise God (saith S. Augustin) *in hunc but dishonour God and Christ, as if God were not faithful in his promise, as if psal.* Christ were dispossessed of his kingdome the Catholique Church. Lest anie should replie, that Christs praise though the Church be decaied, or be very smal, the Holie Ghost hath prevented such arguments, saying : *v. 26. This praise is in the great Church*. Which could neither be verified in the part of Donatistes in Afrike, nor now in the part of Protestantes since Luther in Europe. Further S. Augustin explicateth, & urgeth the verses folowing in this Psalme, against the same blind, deafe, and obstinate Donatistes, who did not, or would not see, nor heare, that *al the endes of the earth shal remember, and be converted to our Lord*. The holie Scripture faith not, *the endes of the earth*, but *al the endes* : yet too (saith this [great Doctor) peradventure there is but one verse, thou talkest with thy brother, when one read this; marke, he repeateth and knocketh : *even the deafe, al the families of the Gentiles shal adore in his sight*: Yet the heretike is deaf, he heareth not, let one knocke againe : *because the kingdom is our Lords, and he shal have dominion over the Gentiles*. Hold these three verses bretheren. Thus wrote S. Augustin against those that thinke the true Church may faile, or become invisible or obscure. And though it be not in like prosperous state at al times, and in al places, yet it is alwayes conspicuous, and more general then anie other congregation professing whatsoever pretensed religion.

[^2] <sup>27</sup> *The poore shal eate.* ] Seing this Psalme is of Christ, as is proved by S. Pauls allegation of 23 verse, and by the concordance therof with the Evangelists, it necessarily deduceth, that the *poore* mentioned in the former verse, and these wordes, *the poore shal eate and be filled*, can not be referred to the sacrifices of the old Testament, but to the blessed Sacrifice and Sacrament of the Eucharist, which our Saviour promised, after he had replenished the people with five loaves, and which he instituted at his last supper in presence of his Apostles. So S. Augustin teacheth not to understand it, and to teach, as wel in his double exposition of this Psalme as in his 120. Epistle. c. 27. The poore, that is the humble and poore in spirit shal eate & be filled, the satte ones, or the rich being proud, do also adore and eate, but are not filled. They also are brought to the table of Christ, and participate his bodie & bloud, but they adore only, are not also filled, because they do not imitate : (Christ humbled) they disdaine to be humble. Where it is clere, this holie father by Christs bodie and bloud meaneth not bread and wine as signes of his bodie and bloud, for bread and wine cannot be lawfully adored; neither doth he meane our Lords bodie as it was on the crosse, or is in heaven, for so it is not eaten, but as it is in formes of bread and wine on Christs table, the Altar.
