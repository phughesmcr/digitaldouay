<sup>30</sup>And Phinees stood, and pacified: and the slaughter ceased.

<sup>31</sup>And it was reputed to him unto justice, in generation and generation even for ever.

<sup>32</sup>And they provoked him at the waters of contradiction: and <sup>33</sup>Moyses was vexed for them: because they exasperated his spirit.

[^1]

<sup>34</sup>And he playnely affirmed in his lippes: they destroyed not the nations, of which our Lord spake to them.

<sup>35</sup>And they were mingled among the nations, and learned <sup>36</sup>their workes: and they served their sculptils: and it became a scandal to them.

<sup>37</sup>And they immolated their sonnes, and their daughters to divels.

<sup>38</sup>And they shed innocent bloud: the bloud of their sonnes and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the sculptils of Chanaan.

<aside>Some Iewes offered these most cruel, vnnatural, and abominable sacrifices: as in the times of Iudges, when they were mingled with idolatrous people, and serued their goddes: Iud. 2. v. 11. c. 3. v. 6. But it is more expresse after Dauids time, wherof he here prophesieth, and was verefyed by Achaz. 4. Reg. 16. v. 3. and by Manasses. 4. Reg. 21. v. 6. Which with other idolatrie king Iosias destroyed. 4. Reg 23. v. 11.</aside>

<sup>39</sup>And the land was infected with bloud, and was contaminated in their workes: and they did fornicate in their inventions.

<sup>40</sup>And our Lord was wrath with furie vpon his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.

<sup>41</sup>And he delivered them into the handes of the nations: and they that hated them, had the dominion of them.

<sup>42</sup>And their enimies afflicted them: and they were humble vnder their handes: <sup>43</sup>he did often deliver them.

[^2]

But they exasperated him in their counsel: and they were humbled in their iniquities.

<sup>44</sup>And he saw when they were afflicted: and he heard their prayer.

<sup>45</sup>And he was mindeful of his testament: and it repented him according to the multitude of his mercie.

[^1]: Moyses afflicted in spirit, by the enormous murmuring of the people, doubted whether God would geue them water of the rocke or no, not doubting of his powre, but of his wil: and so when he should haue spoke to the rocke, Num. 20. v. 8. he spoke to the incredulous people. v. 10. and therin offended God, for which he was temporally punished. v. 12. Deut. 1. v. 37. & c. 3. v. 26. c. 4. v. 21.

[^2]: God respected them with his merciful eye, and gaue them grace to repent.
