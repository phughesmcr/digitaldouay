[^1]

<sup>7</sup>When he is judged, let him come forth condemned: and let his prayer be turned into sinne.

<sup>8</sup>Let his dayes be made fewe: and let an other take his bishopricke.

<sup>9</sup>Let his children be made orphans: and his wife a widow.

<sup>10</sup>Let his children be transported wandering, and let them begge: and let them be cast out of their habitations.

<sup>11</sup>Let the usurer search al his substance: and let strangers spoile his labours.

<sup>12</sup>Let there be none to helpe him: neither let there be anie to have pittie on his pupilles.

<sup>13</sup>Let his children come to destruction: in *h* one generation let his name be cleane put out.

<sup>14</sup>Let the iniquitie of his fathers returne to memorie in the sight of our Lord: and let not the sinne of his mother be blotted out.

<sup>15</sup>Let them be before our Lord alwayes, and let the memorie of them perish out of the earth: <sup>16</sup>For that he remembred not to doe mercie.

<sup>17</sup>And he persecuted the poore, and needie man, and the compunct in hart to kil him.

<sup>18</sup>And he i loued cursing, and it shal come to him: and he would not blessing, and it shal be far from him. And he put on cursing *as* a garment, and it entred as water into his inner partes, and as oile in his bones.

<sup>19</sup>Be it to him as a garment, wherwith he is couered: and as a girdle, wherwith he is alwayes girded.

<sup>20</sup>This is the worke of them, that detract from me before our Lord: and that speake euils against my soule.

<sup>21</sup>And thou Lord, Lord, doe with me for thy names sake: because thy mercie is sweete.

<sup>22</sup>Deliuer me because I am needie, and poore: and *k* my hart is trubled within me.

<sup>23</sup>As a shadow when it declineth, am I taken away: and I am shaken as locustes.

<sup>24</sup>My knees are weakened with fasting: and my flesh is changed by reason of oile.

<sup>25</sup>And I am made a reproch to them: they saw me, and wagged their heades.

[^1]: The office of Apostleship. The poste ritie, or succession of wicked persecuters prosper not long in this world.

*h* Arch heretikes that deuise newe opinions, are shortly forgotten, their followers stil coining new heresies of their owne, dissenting from their false maisters.

*i* Let them obserue this, that vse more swearing and blaspheming, then praying or meditating.

*k* Christes soule was pensiue when he prayed in the garden, and he did workes of penance for our sinnes at his life.
