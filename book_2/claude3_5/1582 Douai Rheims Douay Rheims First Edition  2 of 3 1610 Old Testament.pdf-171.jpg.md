present death if he stand constant, and damnation if he denie his faith. Somtimes the tentation is more vehement, but yet obscure, which he calleth, sufferes walking in darknes: when by false endeuoures, framing argumentes in excuse of sinne, men are perswaded that they may lawfully take some oath, or do some other thing, which in dede is not lawful: and so by earnest, and suttle perswasions they ignorantly decline from Catholique Religion, or commit other greuous sinnes. But the greatest and manifest tentation is called inuasion & midday diuel: when persecuters seing neither more easie perswasions can deceaue Gods seruants, nor present death force them to denie the truth, they then assault them more vehemently, and more dangerously with long, and continual afflictions, not remitting their crueltic til the afflicted either yeld to their wil, or dye in long tormentes. And by these two latter kindes of persecution manie are ouerthrowne, which were constant in the former. For whiles tyrants proponed dangers to simple people, and deceaued some, yet threatning present death to others, that were better instructed, and confirmed in Religion, innumerable preferred eternal, and gloriously died in confession of Christian Catholique faith. But by suttle arguing of hard pointes of christian doctrin or paradise; and by long tormentes manie haue bene seduced, blindly falling into errors, and manie wittingly haue denied the truth, which they clerly beleued in their hartes, to auoide this midday diuel, the extremitie of long manifest, and greuous afflictions. Neuertheles in al these tentations God protecteth them that firmly trust in him. Those (saith this holie Father) haue failed, none but those which presumed of themselues, which dwelt not in the helpe of the Highest, that first leaue and in protection of the God of heauen: which said not to our Lord: Thou art my Protector, and my refuge, which trusted not vnder the shadow of his winges, but relied, or attributed much to their owne strength.

PSALME XCI.

*God is by al maner of voices and instrumentes to be praised in his admirable workes. 7. which the foolish not seing are punished; 11. and the wise are rewarded.*

<sup>1</sup> A Psalme of Canticle, in the sabbath day.[^1]

<sup>2</sup> It is good to confesse to our Lord; and to sing to thy name ô Highest:[^2]

<sup>3</sup> To shew forth thy mercie in the morning: and thy truth in the night.[^3]

<sup>4</sup> In f the instrument of tenstrings, in g Psalter: with Canticle, on h the Harpe.[^4]

<sup>5</sup> Because thou hast delighted me ô Lord in thy workmanship: and in the workes of thy handes I wil reioyce.

[^1]: a Voices beginning instrumentes prosecute this song: b when we rest from worke then especially we ought to thinke vpon Gods workes, praise and thanke him for the same.

[^2]: c To geue thankes.

[^3]: d In prosperitie, e in aduersitie.

[^4]: f On an instrument of tenne stringes, signifying the obseruation of the tenne commandments: g namely on the Psalter. h Also on the harpe, which signifieth mortification.
