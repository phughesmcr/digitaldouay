OF PSALMES 169

<sup>15</sup> We haue reioyced for the daies wherein thou hast humbled vs: the yeares, wherin we haue seene euils.

*Yea the more we suffer in this life for the truth, the greater is our comforth in hope of reward.*

<sup>16</sup> Looke vpon r thy seruants, and vpon thy workes: and direct their children.

<aside>r Not only in that we are thy creatures, but also in that we are thy seruants, we are thy proper worke, therfore in both these respectes, Ã´ God looke vpon vs with clemencie. s lead also our posteritie into the right way, and make them thy seruantes.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> And s let the brightnes of our Lord God be vpon vs, and direct thou the workes of our handes ouer vs: and y the worke of our handes doe thou direct.

<aside>t O God illuminate our vnderstanding, v make our actions by thy grace profitable to vs: w and make perfect in vs the worke of faith: In which one worke, al good workes are included and to which al other are directed. For then workes are right (sayth S. Augustin) when they are directed to this one end.</aside>
