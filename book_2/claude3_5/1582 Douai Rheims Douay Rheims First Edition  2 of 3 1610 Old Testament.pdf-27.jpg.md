OF PSALMES. 27

<aside>Why is thy clothing redde, and thy garments as theirs, that tread in the wine presse? I have troden the presse alone. S. Au- gustin also applieth it morally to the Church, where Christ is the vine, the Apostles are the branches, & spreaders (that is preachers) of the Ghospel, Chri- stians are the grapes, Christian vertues are the wine. Namely patience, and fortitude in afflictions. Whereby the good are purified, and severed from a- mides the reprobate, as wine is pressed out of the grapes, barreled, and laid vp in sellers, and * the huskes and carnels cast to hogges, or other beastes.</aside>

PSALME. IX.

*The Church prayseth God for her protection, 4. in repelling the enemies force, 8. in punishing the wicked, and rewarding the iust.*

1 To the end, for the secrets of the sonne, the Psalme of David.

<aside>Christs de- minie, and Christians afflictions, are hidden from the world, in Gods providence.</aside>

6 Thou hast rebuked the g Gentiles, and the impious hath pe- g *Al sinners* rished: their h name thou hast destroyed for euer, and for euer *called gentiles, and euer. because generally accounted wicked.*

<aside>h The vaine glorious fame of sinners partly decayeth in this world, but most especially in the world to come.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> The swordes of the enemie haue fayled vnto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed:

<sup>8</sup> Their memorie hath perished with a sound: and our Lord abideth for euer.

9 He hath prepared his throne in i iudgement: † & he wil iudge i *iudicial sea- the whole world in equitie, he wil iudge the peo- le in iustice. te of most iust iudgement.*

<sup>10</sup> And our Lord is made a' refuge for the poore: an helper k *God doth in oportune times, in tribulation. not presently deliuer the good from affliction: but when it is their spiritual profite.*
