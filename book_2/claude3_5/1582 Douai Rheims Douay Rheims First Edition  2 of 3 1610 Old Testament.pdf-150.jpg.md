<sup>7</sup>Because they have devoured Jacob: and his place they have made desolate.

<sup>8</sup>Remember not our old iniquities, let thy mercies quickly prevent us: because we are become exceeding poore.

[^1]

<sup>9</sup>Help us O God our saviour: and for the glorie of thy name O Lord deliver us: and be propicious to our sinnes for thy names sake.

<sup>10</sup>Lest they say perhaps amongst the Gentiles: *where is their God?* and be notified in the nations before our eies. The revenge of the bloud of thy servants, which hath benne shed: <sup>11</sup>let the groning of thefettered enter in thy sight.

[^2]

According to the greatnes of thine arme, possesse thou *the children of them that are put to death*.

[^3]

<sup>12</sup>And render to our neighboures sevenfold in their bosome: their reproch wherewith they have reproched thee O Lord.

[^4]

<sup>13</sup>But we thy people, and the sheepe of thy pasture, wil confesse to thee for ever:

[^5]

Unto generation and generation we wil shew forth thy praise.

PSALME LXXIX.

*The Prophet prayeth for the release of Israel in great tribulation. 15. forsheweth the coming of Christ to redeme man from sinne, and from thraldome of the divel.*

<sup>1</sup>Unto *a* the end, for *b* them, that shal be changed, testimonie to *c* Asaph, a Psalme.

[^6]

[^1]: Especially when they repent, and confesse their sinnes, then those that neither know nor wil know God; but obstinately impugne and resist the truth, & so much afflicted, and despised, that none wil regard the truth which we professe.

[^2]: Albeit O Lord, thou sufferest to be punished, yet suffer not thyn enemies to insult, as though thou were not our God; and consequently thou haddest no people at al in the world. Therefore we pray, that the revenge of thy servants bloud may be notified, that it can not be denied, nor doubted of. Which is also here prophecied, that it wil so come to passe in the end.

[^3]: Preserve also, Ã´ God, the reliques of thy servants, the successors of thy Martyrs.

[^4]: This also is a prophecie, that God wil most severely revenge the blasphemie of persecutors.

[^5]: Gods people delivered from persecution, and perpetually conserved, wil alwayes praise God for the same.

[^6]: a Perteyning to the new Testament, b especially to Gentiles, that shal be converted to Christ. c for perpetual memorie to the congregation of faithful.
