<sup>1</sup> A Canticle of Psalme to Asaph.

<sup>2</sup> O God *a* who shal be like to thee? *b* hold not thy peace, *c* neither be thou appeased ô God:

[^2]

<sup>3</sup> For behold *d* thine enimies haue made a sound: they that hate thee, *e* haue lifted vp the head.

[^3]

<sup>4</sup> They haue taken malignant counsel vpon thy people: and they haue deuised against thy saincts.

<sup>5</sup> They haue saide: Come, and let vs destroy them out of *f* the nation: and let *g* the name of Israel be remembred no more.

<sup>6</sup> Because they haue deuised with one consent: they haue together made a couenant against thee.

<sup>7</sup> The tabernacles of *h* the Idumeans, and *i* the Ismahelites *k* Moab, and *l* the Agarens,

[^5]
