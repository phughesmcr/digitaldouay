[^1]<sup>2</sup> His seede shal be mightie in the earth: the generation of the righteous shal be blessed,

<sup>3</sup> Glorie, and riches in his house: and his iustice abideth for euer and euer.

[^2]

<sup>4</sup> Light is risen vp in darkenes to the righteous: he is merciful, and pitiful, and iust.

[^3]

<sup>5</sup> Acceptable is the man, that is merciful and lendeth, that <sup>6</sup> shal dispose his wordes in iudgement: Because he shal not be moued for euer.

[^4]

<sup>7</sup> The iust shal be in eternal memorie: he shal not feare at the hearing of euil.

<sup>8</sup> His hart is readie to hope in our Lord, his hart is confirmed: <sup>9</sup> he shal not be moued til he looke ouer his enemies.

<sup>10</sup> He distributed, he gaue to the poore: his iustice remaineth for euer and euer his horne shal be exalted in glorie.

<sup>11</sup> The sinner shal see, and wil be angrie, he shal gnash his teeth and pine away: the desire of sinners shal perish.

[^5]

Alleluia.

<sup>1</sup> PRAYSE our Lord ye children: praise ye the name of our Lord.

<sup>2</sup> Be the name of our Lord blessed, from henceforth now and for euer.

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sunne vnto the going downe, the name of our Lord is laudable.

<sup>4</sup> Our Lord is high aboue al nations, and his glorie aboue the heauens.

<sup>5</sup> Who is as the Lord our God, that dwelleth on high, <sup>6</sup> and beholdeth the low thinges in heauen and in earth?

<sup>7</sup> Raising vp the neeide from the earth, and lifting vp the poore out of the dung:

[^1]: So doing he and his shal prosper.

[^2]: The iust shal not only prosper in this world but also in the next.

[^3]: God wil also comfort the iust in tribulations.

[^4]: That shal geue discrete and wholsome counsel to the afflicted.

[^5]: Workes of mercie are also called iustice, because they conduce to mans iustification, and to his saluation.
