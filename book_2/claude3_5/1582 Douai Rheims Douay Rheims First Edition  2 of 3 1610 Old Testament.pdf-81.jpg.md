OF PSALMES. 81

<sup>9</sup> In the head of the booke it is written of me, that I should doe thy wil: my God I would, and thy law in the middes of my hart.

<aside>The summe of holie Scripture is of Christs Incarnation & death for redemption of man.</aside>

<sup>10</sup> I haue declared thy iustice in the great Church, loe I wil not stay my lippes: Lord thou hast knowen it.

<aside>Heauie Christ inculcateth the preaching and receiuing of his Gospel in the whole world.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Thy iustice I haue not hid in my hart: thy truth and thy saluation I haue spoken. I haue not hid thy mercie, and thy truth from the great councel.

[^1]

<sup>12</sup> But thou ô Lord make not thy commiserations farre from me: thy mercie and thy truth haue alwayes receiued me.

[^2]

<sup>13</sup> Because euils haue compassed me, which haue no number: mine iniquities haue ouertaken me, & I was not able to see.

[^3]

They are multiplied aboue the heares of my head: and my hart hath forsaken me.

[^4]

<sup>14</sup> It may please thee ô Lord to deliuer me: Lord haue respect to helpe me.

[^5]

<sup>15</sup> Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seeke my soule, to take it away.

[^6]

Let them be turned backward, and be ashamed that wil me euils.

<sup>16</sup> Let them forthwith receiue their confusion, that say to me: Wel, wel.

[^7]

<sup>17</sup> Let al that seeke thee, reioyce and be glad vpon thee: and let them that loue thy saluation, say alwayes: Our Lord be magnified:

[^8]

[^1]: In the greatest and widest congregations of this world, Christ concealeth not his mercie and truth. So himselfe preached before Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, and theire councels. S. Paul preached Christ at Athens, and in manie nations, and so the other Apostles. For their voice went into al the confines of the earth.

[^2]: The prophet now speaketh in the name of Christs mystical bodie the Church: praying to be made partaker of mercie, and to be deliuered from euiles.

[^3]: The sinnes also of those which beleue in Christ are so manie, that they can not be fully sene in particular.

[^4]: Almost faint in considering so manie and so great iniquities amongst those that professe Christ.

[^5]: The whole Church prayeth in the name of al for the infirme members.

[^6]: The prophet forsheweth that the reprobate for their obstinate malice, seking to hurt others shalbe confounded.

[^7]: that skornfully say: wel, wel: wishing al euil to good men.

[^8]: which not only in mouth and outward profession, but also in sinceritie of hart seeke thee, may with confidence reioyce, and praise God.
