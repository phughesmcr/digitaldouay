OF PSALMES. 153

<sup>4</sup> Sound ye with trumpet in the new moone, in the notable day of your solemnities.[^1]

<sup>5</sup> Because it is a precept in Israel, and iudgement to the God of Iacob.

<sup>6</sup> He put it for a testimonie in Ioseph, when he came out of the Land of Ægypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not.

<sup>7</sup> He turned away his backe from burdens: his handes serued in baskettes.[^2]

<sup>8</sup> In tribulation thou didest inuocate me, and I heard thee: I heard thee in the secret of the tempest: I proued thee at the water of contradiction.[^3]

<sup>9</sup> Heare ô my people: and I wil contest thee: Israel *if* thou wilt heare me.[^4]

<sup>10</sup> There shal be no new God in thee, neither shalt thou adore a strange God.[^5]

<sup>11</sup> For I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Ægypt: dilate thy mouth and I wil fil it.[^6]

<sup>12</sup> And my People heard not my voice: and Israel attended not to me.

<sup>13</sup> And I let them alone, according to the desires of their hart, they shal goe in their owne inuentions.

<sup>14</sup> If my people had heard me: if Israel had walked in my wayes:

<sup>15</sup> I had *p* for nothing, *q* perhaps humbled their enimies: and had laide my hand vpon those that afflict them.[^7]
