<sup>91</sup>By thy ordinance the day continueth: because al thinges serue thee.

<sup>92</sup>But that thy law is my meditation: I had then perhaps perished in my humiliation.

<sup>94</sup>I am thine, saue me: because I haue sought out thy iustifications.

<sup>95</sup>Sinners haue expected me to destroy me: I vnderstood thy testimonies.

<sup>96</sup>Of al consummation I haue sene the end: thy commandment is exceding large.

Mem. Of them.

<sup>97</sup>How haue I loued thy law Ã´ Lord: al the day it is my meditation.

<sup>98</sup>Aboue mine enemies thou hast made me wise by thy commandment: because it is to me for euer.

<sup>99</sup>Aboue al that taught me haue I vnderstood: because thy testimonies are my meditation.

<sup>100</sup>Aboue ancients haue I vnderstood: because I haue sought thy commandments.

<sup>101</sup>I haue staied my feete from al euil way: that I may keepe thy wordes.

<sup>102</sup>I haue not declined from thy iudgements: because thou hast set me a law.

[^1] Al thinges of this world, man excepted, do Gods wil.

[^2] Man, except he meditate Gods law, and therby be holden vp, is in danger, perhaps in eternal damnation to perish eternally: for he can neuer rise out of mortal sinne, by his owne power, and al should perish if Gods mercie did not spare some, and geue them new effectual grace to repent.

[^3] Alwayes vnderstood, that Gods grace preuented, els no man can seeke to obserue the commandments.

[^4] Al worldlie thinges haue their consummation and end: Gods commandment continueth euer. For we are perpetually bound, to loue and serue God: to loue our neighbours, yea and enemies. The reward also for keping Gods commandments, & punishment for breaking them, are eternal without end.

[^5] It is merueilous a perfect iust man, that he hath so much loued, and obserued Gods law. By acknowledging whereof, he yeldeth praise and thankes to God, whose gift it is.

[^6] The fruictes of obseruing Gods law are manie and great. Amongst others, it maketh the obseruer, wiser then his enimies.

[^7] It maketh the obseruer wiser, then his temporal maisters, that taught him, towit, then those that teach wel, and do not performe the same.

[^8] Yea gerin haue I kept Gods commandments, are wiser then the more ancient that kept them not.
