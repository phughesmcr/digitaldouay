OF PSALMES 165

<sup>2</sup> Let Israel be ioyful in him, that made him : and let the children of Sion reioyce in their king.[^1]

<sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name in quire : on tymbre, and psalter let them sing to him :

<sup>4</sup> Because our Lord is wel pleased in his people : and he wil exalt the meeke vnto saluation.

<sup>5</sup> The sainctes shal reioyce in glorie : they shal be ioyful in *b* their beddes.

<sup>6</sup> The *c* exaltations of God in their throte : and *d* two edged swordes in their handes:[^2]

<sup>7</sup> To doe reuenge in the nations : chastisements among the peoples.

<sup>8</sup> To binde their kinges in fetters : and their nobles in yron manicles.[^3]

<sup>9</sup> That they may doe in them the iudgement, that is *e* written: *f* this glorie is to al his sainctes. Alleluia.[^4]

*God absolutely most excellent is to be praised,5. with al sortes of instruments, and by al other meanes.*

1 Alleluia.

PRAYSE ye our Lord *a* in his holies : prayse ye him in *b* the firmament of his strength.[^5]

<sup>2</sup> Prayse ye him in *c* his powers : prayse ye him *d* according to the multitude of his greatnes.[^6]

<aside>*a* Al ye Angels and men that are in the holie and highest heauen praise our Lord.</aside>

<aside>*b* Al ye creatures that are in, and vnder the first moueable firmament praise our Lord.</aside>

<aside>*c* And you specially (Gods peculiar people) amongst whom, and for whom, diuine miracles haue bene wrought praise our Lord, *d* with al your possible endeuoure, for though his infinite Excellencie excedeth the power of al creatures to praise him sufficiently, yet it resteth that you may infinitly extend your wil and desire to praise our Lord, according to the multitude of his greatnes.</aside>

[^2]: *c* Highest praises of God shal be continually vttered by Sainctes in glorie : for stil as praises passe by their tongues and mouthes, more like praises shal succede from their throte, and hartes affection, to our of the abundance of the hart their mouth shal stil speake Gods praise. *d* Glorified Sainctes shal also haue iudiciarie powre. First, al in general shal like and approue Gods iustice in punishing the wicked. Secondly the wicked shal be iustly condemned in the vision of the blessed, who passed through, and ouercame the like, yea and greater tribulations and tentations then those, by which the damned were ouercome. Thirdly, certaine more excellent Sainctes, namely the Apostles, and al those that forsaking proprietie of temporal goodes, geue that they haue to the poore, as some religious Orders doe; or as Communities the Apostles, and manie primitiue Christians did (Mat. 4. v. 10. cap. 19. v. 17. Act. 2. v. 4. v. 34. 1. Cor. 6. v. 3.) shal sitte in iudgement (euen as iudges with Christ, and iudge those that render account, of wel or euil spending the temporal landes or goodes, which they possessed in this world. So teach S. Augustin 5 Ierom. S. Beda, and others.

[^3]: Decreed by God.

[^4]: This iudicial powre is part of Sainctes glorie.

[^5]: God most excellent and most laudable. the first key.

[^6]: *e* Prayse
