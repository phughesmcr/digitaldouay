<sup>12</sup>Because God loveth mercie and truth: our Lord wil geue grace, and glorie.

[^1]The Divine wisdom so vseth mercie, and veritie, that neither may preiudice the other: and so geueth grace in this life, and glorie in the next.

<sup>13</sup>He wil not depriue them of good thinges, that walke in innocencie: ô Lord of hoastes blessed is the man, that hopeth in thee.

[^2]Besides innocencie conserued without sinne, there is also innocencie after remission of sinne, of which the prophet here speaketh.

# PSALME. LXXXIIII.

<aside>Incarnation of Christ, the 5. key.</aside>

*With commemoration of Gods former benefites, 5. Christs Incarnation is prophecied, 9. bringing peace and saluation, 11. mercie and iustice concurring together.*

<sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, to the children of Core, a Psalme.

<sup>2</sup>O Lord thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captiuitie of Iacob.

[^3]God bestowed manie great benefites vpon the people of Israel: he brought them out of the bondage of Ægypt.

<sup>3</sup>Thou hast forgiven the iniquitie of thy people: thou hast couered al their sinnes.

[^4]Remitted their manifold sinnes: pardoned also a great part of due punishment.

<sup>4</sup>Thou hast mitigated al thy wrath: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thine indignation.

<sup>5</sup>Convert vs ô God our sauiour: and auert thy wrath from vs.

[^5]As thou hast shewed thy peculiar people, so we besech thee ô God creator and general Sauiour of al mankind, mitigate thy wrath towards vs al

<sup>6</sup>Wilt thou be wrath with vs for euer? or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation vnto generation?

<sup>7</sup>O God thou being turned shalt quicken vs: and thy people shal reioyce in thee.

[^6]Til God first shew his mercie, sinners lye dead in guilt of sinne, but by his grace they are stirred vp, and quickened: and ioyfully returne to God.

<sup>8</sup>Shew vs ô Lord thy mercie: and giue vs thy saluation.

<sup>9</sup>I wil heare what our Lord God wil speake in me: because he wil speake peace vpon his people.

[^7]The wordes of the prophet, signifying that God had reueled vnto him the redemption of mankind.

And vpon his saincts: and vpon them, that are conuerted to the hart.

<aside>Not al men are iustified, and saued, but those that are hartely and sincerely conuerted.</aside>
