THE BOOKE

<sup>4</sup>Because a thousand years before thine eies, are as yesterday, that is past.

[^1]

And as a watch in the night, <sup>5</sup>things that are counted nothing shal their yeares be.

<sup>6</sup>In the morning as an herbe he shal passe, in the morning he shal florish, and passe: in the euening he shal fal, be hardened, and withered.

[^2]

<sup>7</sup>Because we haue faynted in thy wrath, and in thy furie we are trubled.

<sup>8</sup>Thou hast put our iniquities in thy sight: our *age in the light of thy countenance.

<aside>*Secu lum.</aside>

[^3]

<sup>9</sup>Because al our daies haue failed: and in thy wrath we haue failed.

Our yeares shal be considered as a spyder: <sup>10</sup>the daies of our yeares in them, are seuentie yeares.

[^4]

And if in strong ones eightie years: and the more of them, labour and sorrow.

[^5]

Because mildenes is come vpon vs: and we shal be chastised.

[^6]

<sup>11</sup>Who knoweth the powre of thy wrath: and for feare <sup>12</sup>to number thy wrath?

[^7]

So make thy righthand knowne: and men learned in hart, in wisdome.

<sup>13</sup>Turne Ã´ Lord, how long? and be intreated for thy seruants.

<sup>14</sup>We are replenished in the morning with thy mercie: and we haue reioyced, and are delighted al our daies.

We

[^1]: Though some liued long (none for al that did reach to a thousand yeares) yet it is nothing before God, and in respect of eternitie.

[^2]: The youth of man quickly passeth: & old-age can not last long: wherof cometh our English prouerb: A young man may dye sovvne, an old man can not liue long.

[^3]: Sinne the cause of shortnes of mans life.

[^4]: Mans life as brittle as a spiders web: or mans life passeth continually, as a spider wasteth her self by spinning, and consuming her owne substance.

[^5]: These numbers literally shew the shortnes of the longer sorte of mens liues. Myst cally, seuen signifie the rest after laboures of this world, and perteyn to the old testament: eight signifie the reward in the resurrection, perteyning to the new testament Which multiplied by tenne, a perfect number, make seuentie and eightie. Which ioyned together make an hundred and fiftie. The number of al these Psalmes.

[^6]: It is of Gods milde prouidence, that mans life is short, for that manie if they were sure, or had probabilitie to liue long, would presume to sinne more.

[^7]: Seing God of his iustice punished al mankind, for one sinne of our first parentes, his wrath must nedes be very great to euerie sinner, for his owne proper sinnes.

[^8]: The hope of glorious resurrection turneth our calamities into spiritual ioy.
