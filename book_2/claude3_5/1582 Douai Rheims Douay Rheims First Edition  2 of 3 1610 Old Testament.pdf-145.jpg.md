<sup>27</sup>And he rayned vpon them flesh as dust: and as the sand of the sea fethered fowles.

<sup>28</sup>And they fel in the middes of their campe: about their tabernacles.

<sup>29</sup>And they did eate and were filled exceedingly, and their desire he brought to them:

<sup>30</sup>They were not defrauded of their desire.

<aside>As yet their meats were in their mouth:</aside>

<sup>31</sup>And the wrath of God ascended vpon them.

And he killed their fat ones, and *d* the chosen of Israel he hindered.

[^1]

<sup>32</sup>In al these things they sinned as yet: and they beleeued not in his meruelous workes.

<sup>33</sup>And their daies failed in vanitie: and their years *e* in hast.

[^2]

<sup>34</sup>When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned, and *f* early they came to him.

[^3]

<sup>35</sup>And they remembred that God is their helper: and the high God is their redemer.

<sup>36</sup>And they loued him *g* with their mouth, and with their tongue they did lie to him.

[^4]

<sup>37</sup>But their hart was not right with him: neither were they counted faithful in his testament.

<sup>38</sup>*h* But he is merciful, and wil be propicious to their sinnes: and he wil not destroy them.

[^5]

And he abunded to turne away his wrath: and he kindled not al his wrath.

<sup>39</sup>And he remembered that they are flesh: *i* spirit going, and not returning.

[^6]

<sup>40</sup>How *k* often haue they exasperated him in the desert: prouoked him to wrath in the place without water.

[^7]

[^1]: The most fresh strong men died, and so were hindered from possessing the promised land of Chanaan

[^2]: *In fourtie yeares aboue six hundred thousand died.*

[^3]: *They offeÂ­red morning sacrifices.*

[^4]: *But were not sincere in their hartes.*

[^5]: Howsoeuer multitudes of people committe great sinnes, and are seuerely punished, yet Gods mercie preserueth some by his effectual grace, and neuer suffereth the whole Church to faile, nor to be destroyed.

[^6]: *Mans life is like the winde, that stil passeth, and the same returneth not. As Aristotel teacheth. Here the Hebrewes note the middes of the Psalter, in 1263. verses: and so manie in the rest.*

[^7]: The people of Israel murmured so often in the desert, that it was not easie to tel how often. See the Annotation.
