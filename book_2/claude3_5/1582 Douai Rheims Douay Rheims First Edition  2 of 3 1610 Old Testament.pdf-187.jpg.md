OF PSALMES                                187

<sup>8</sup> Our Lord is *n* pitiful, and *o* merciful : *p* long suffering, and very merciful.

<sup>9</sup> He wil *q* not be angrie alwayes : neither wil he threaten for euer.

<sup>10</sup> He hath not done to vs according to our sinnes : neither according to our iniquities hath he rewarded vs.

<sup>11</sup> For according to the height of heauen from the earth : hath he strengthned his mercie vpon them that feare him.

<sup>12</sup> As far *r* as the East is distant from the West : hath he made our iniquities far from vs.

<sup>13</sup> As a father hath compassion of his children, so hath our <sup>14</sup> Lord compassion on them that feare him : † because he hath knowen / our making.

<sup>15</sup> He remembred that we are dust : † man, his daies are as grasse, as the floure of the fielde so shal he florish.

<sup>16</sup> Because the spirit shal passe in him, and he shal not stand: and he shal know his place no more.

<sup>17</sup> But the mercie of our Lord from euerlasting, and vnto euerlasting vpon them that feare him.

And his iustice is vpon the childrens children, to them that keepe his testament.

<sup>18</sup> And are mindful of his commandmentes, to *t* doe them.

<sup>19</sup> Our Lord hath prepared his seate in heauen : and his kingdom shal haue dominion ouer al.

<sup>20</sup> Blesse our Lord al ye his Angels : mightie in powre, doing his word, that feare the voice of his wordes.

<sup>21</sup> Blesse our Lord al ye his hostes: you his ministers, that doe his wil.

<sup>22</sup> Blesse ye our Lord *v* al his workes: in euerie place *w* of his dominion, my soule blesse thou our Lord.

<aside>*n* God is naturally pitiful, to releeue the afflicted. *o* merciful towards sinners. *p* loth to be angrie, or to punish.</aside>

<aside>*q* God punisheth not penitents with eternal paine, but with temporal: for though (as in the next verse) our sinnes of their owne nature, deserue eternal punishment, yet Christ paying our ransome, true penitents are only punished temporally.</aside>

<aside>*r* See here the perfect washing away, and separation of sinnes.</aside>

<aside>*s* In regard of our frailtie he hath compassion: yet his mercie only auaileth to them that feare him: as in the next wordes before, and v. 17.</aside>

<aside>*t* A iust man not only knoweth, and remembreth, but also doth the commandments.</aside>

<aside>*v* Al creatures, though naturally senseles, yet praise God, because they are his worke,</aside>

<aside>*w* and because they are in his dominion.</aside>
