Life.

<sup>57</sup> My portion Lord, I sayd to keepe thy law.

<aside>The Prophet proceedeth speaking in the person of the iust tending to perfection, and saying: This is my happie choise, that I desire no other enheritance, nor possession, but to keepe Gods Law.</aside>

<sup>58</sup> I besought thy face, with al my hart: haue mercie on me according to thy word.

<aside>And seeing this excedeth my proper strength, I prayed God of his mercie to make me able to kepe it.</aside>

<sup>59</sup> I e thought vpon my wayes: and conuerted my feete vnto thy testimonies.

<aside>Pondering my former actions, I turned my pathes to obserue more perfectly the Law, which God hath testified to be the right way.</aside>

<sup>60</sup> I d am prepared, and am not trubled: to keepe thy commandments.

<aside>With promptnes of mind, and without hesitation I resolued to kepe the commandments.</aside>

<sup>61</sup> The e cordes of sinners haue wrapped me round about: and f I haue not forgotten thy law.

<aside>The wicked laide cordes, nettes, or snares to intrappe, and hinder me, & but I kept thy law fresh in memorie.</aside>

<sup>62</sup> At g midnight I rose to confesse to thee; for the iudgements of thy iustification.

[^1]

<sup>63</sup> I am partaker of al that feare thee: and that keepe thy commandments.

<aside>A great benefite, and a singular consolation, that al true liuing members of Christ, are partakers of al the prayers, good workes, and merites, of the whole Church militant and triumphant. Which in our Crede is called, The Communion of Sainctes.</aside>

<sup>64</sup> The i earth O Lord is ful of thy mercie: k teach me thy iustifications.

<aside>So great is the mercie of God, extended, communicated, and multiplied in the whole earth: I iustified me, and direct me therfore O God, that I may learne and obserue thy law, and so be iustified, and made participant of so great mercie.</aside>

Teth. Good.

<sup>65</sup> Thou hast a done bountie with thy seruant O Lord: b according to thy word.

[^2]

[^1]: This is not to be vnderstood only mystically in time of affliction, but also literally and prophetically, that some special seruantes of God, should obserue a godlie profession of praying at midnight, the word [I rose] maketh it probable. S. Paul & Silas, either of a holie custome, or at least vpon special occasion (and such occasions were to them, and others frequent) prayed, and praised God at midnight. And now in the Church of Christ some religious men pray, and praise God continually at midnight, besides other houres, mentioned more distinctly v. 164.

[^2]: a Dealt very bountifully b as thou didst promise.
