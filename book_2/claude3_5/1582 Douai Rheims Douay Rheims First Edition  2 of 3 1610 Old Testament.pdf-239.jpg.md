thought it rather a vision, then a true deliuerie. Such spiritual ioy deuoute soules haue when they are deliuered from sinne.

<sup>2</sup> Then was our mouth replenished with ioy: and our tongue with exultation.

Then *b* shal they say among the Gentiles: Our Lord hath done magnifically with them.

<aside>b Wheras in the two former verses (and very commonly) the Prophet speaketh in the preter tense, for the assurance of that he foresheweth, as if it were already donne, yet here he vttereth his prophecie in the future tense, that the Gentiles wil confesse that God dealeth magnifically with his people.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Our Lord hath done magnifically with vs: we are made ioyful.

<sup>4</sup> Turne our captiuitie Ã´ Lord, *c* as a torrent in the South.

<aside>c The Prophet forseing al this in spirit, prayeth for the performance therof.</aside>

<aside>d And that it may spedely be done, as a torrent that runneth in the south part of the world, is commonly very great, much desired, but scarce expected.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> They that sow in teares, *e* shal reape in ioyfulnesse.

<aside>e This is the ordinarie disposition of God, that his seruants shal make their seding, which is, doe good workes (saith S. Augustin) with teares, in tribulation vpon earth:</aside>

<aside>f and reape a plentiful haruest, the reward of their suffering and wel working, in the next life. In assured hope whereof the Psalmist, and the whole Church ioyfully conclude this Psalme with the two verses folowing.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Going they went and wept, casting their seedes.

<sup>7</sup> But coming they shal come with exultation, carying their sheaues.

PSALME CXXVI.

*Neither house nor citie can be built, or kept without Gods special prouidence and helpe, 3. those that trust in him shal prosper in their endeuours.*

[^1]

1 A gradual Canticle *a* of Salomon.

<aside>a God not permitting Dauid to build the Temple, promised that his sonne should build it:and therfore besides other good admonitions, geuen to his sonne Salomon, he directeth this Psalme to be song at the building therof. 3. Reg. 8.2. Par. 1.</aside>

VNLESSE *b* our Lord build the house, they haue laboured in vayne that build it.

<aside>b Vnlesse God be the principal Agent, no worke can prosper.</aside>

Vnlesse our Lord kepe the citie, he watcheth in vayne that keepeth it.

<sup>2</sup> It is vaine for you to rise *c* before light: *d* rise ye after ye haue sitten, which eate *e* the bread of sorow.

<aside>c It is vaine to attempt anie thing without Gods grace assisting: d they that so doing, & thinking they haue done something, rest a after their painful trauel, must rise againe & beginne anew, because that which they seme to haue done wel, is nothing worth, nor shal haue reward.</aside>

[^1]: Gods helpe in al good workes, the j. key.
