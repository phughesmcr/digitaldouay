ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XXI.

1. *For the morning enterprise.*] In respect of the end for which Christ suffered, this Psalme is intitled *For the morning enterprise*, that is, for Christs glorious Resurrection, and other effects of his Passion. Which holie Dauid by the spirite of prophecy so describeth here long before with diuers particular circumstances as if the Euangelistes haue since historically recorded, that it may not vntily be called, *The Passion of Iesus Christ according to Dauid*.

2. *Thou wilt not heare.*] Our B. Sauiour fearing his most terrible death imminent, prayed conditionally, *if it pleased his heauenlie Father*, to haue the same remoued from him: and was not heard, as the Psalmist here prophecieth. The principal reason was, because God of his diuine iustice had decreed, that mankind should be redemed by this death of his Sonne. Christ also him selfe of his excellent charitie, consented here vnto & therfore persisted not in his conditional prayer, but added and absolutly prayed, that not his owne wil, but his Fathers might be fulfilled. And so was heard in his owne more glorie, and other infinite benefites of innumerable soules, yet foloweth, *v. 25. when I cried to him he heard me*. S. Paul also witnesseth (Heb. 5. v. 7.) that Christ *praying and supplicating to him that could saue him from death, was heard for his reuerence*: that is, in respect of his inestimable merite in humane nature vnited in person to God. Another cause, why Christ was not deliuered from violent death, as manie holie persons were, when they cried to God in distresses, as S. Augustin sheweth (Epist. 120. c. 11.) was for example to Christians, whom God wil haue to suffer temporal afflictions, and death, for the glorie of life euerlasting, according to S. Peters doctrin, *Christ suffered for vs, leauing an example that you may folow his steppes*.

18. *They haue digged.*] Of obstinate malice the Iewes haue corrupted this place (and God knoweth how manie others) in the Hebrew text of some editions, reading *caari*, which signifieth *as a lion*, without al coherence of the sense: for *caaru they digged or pearced*, to auoid so plaine a prophecie of nailing Christs handes and feete to the crosse.

[^1]: Although men can neither deserue to be conuerted, nor to perseuer in iustice: yet Christ meriteth to haue a continual kingdom, which is the perpetual visible Catholique Church.

[^2]: Not only the poore sorte, but also the mightie ones of the world shal be conuerted to Christ, participate his B. Bodie in the Sacrament: and religiously adore the same. Al that adore God, shal adore him in this Sacrament.

[^3]: Death being once ouercome, the Catholique Church.

[^4]: Apostles, and other preachers of Christ.
