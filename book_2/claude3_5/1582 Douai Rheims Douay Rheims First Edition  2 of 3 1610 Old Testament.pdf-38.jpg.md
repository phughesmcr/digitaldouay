Mine enemies haue compassed my soule, <sup>10</sup> they haue shut vp their fatte: their mouth hath spoken pride.

[^1]: they haue shut out al pitie or commiseration.

<sup>11</sup> Casting me forth now haue they compassed me: they haue sette their eies to bend them vnto the earth.

[^2]: They intend utterly to destroy me euen to the ground.

<sup>12</sup> They haue taken me as a lion readie to the pray: and as a lions whelpe dwelling in hid places.

<sup>13</sup> Arise Lord, preuent him, and supplant him: deliuer my soule from the impious, <sup>14</sup> thy sword from the enemies of thy hand.

[^3]: Except God preuent, mans industry is not sufficient, that they may no persecute so much as they intend.

Lord from a few out of the land diuide them, *f* in their life: their bellie is filled of thy secretes.

[^4]: This is a prophecy, that the wicked shal be separated from the elect & the pleasures of this world, which God approueth not, nor acknowledgeth amongst good thinges.

They are filled with children: and they haue leaft their remnantes to their litle ones.

<sup>15</sup> But I in iustice shal appeare to thy sight: I shal be filled when thy glorie shal appeare:

[^5]: Nothing doth satiate mans minde, but the sight of God in eternal glorie.
