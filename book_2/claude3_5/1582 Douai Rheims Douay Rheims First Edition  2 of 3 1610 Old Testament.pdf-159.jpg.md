OF PSALMES. 159

<sup>10</sup> But yet his saluation is nigh to them that m feare him: that glorie may inhabite in our land.

<aside>m Though al be not saued (because manie wil not cooperate to Gods grace) yet verie manie hauing the feare of God, which is the beginning of godlie wisdom, freely accept of Gods mercies, and so the Church is gloriously propagated.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> n Mercie and truth haue met each other: r iustice and peace haue kissed.

<aside>n Whereas Gods mercie would saue al, and his truth, or iustice requireth that sinnes be duly punished, by Christs passion and death, sufficient satisfaction is offered for al sinnes, and those that wil be partakers by penance, and conformitie to Gods law, may haue remission, r and so iustice is obserued, and peace made between God and his subiects.</aside>

<sup>12</sup> p Truth is risen out of the earth: q and iustice hath looked downe from heauen.

<aside>p Integritie of conscience reigneth in good men, q God sending iust meanes from heauen to saue them.</aside>

<sup>13</sup> For r our Lord certes wil geue benignitie: and s our land shal geue her fruite.

<aside>r God geueth grace, s and men yeld fruict.</aside>

<sup>14</sup> t Iustice shal walke before him: and shal set his steppes in the way.

<aside>t To they walke in iustice, and right path of Gods law.</aside>
