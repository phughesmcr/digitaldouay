<sup>12</sup> They compassed me as bees, and were inflamed as fire in thornes: and in the name of our Lord I was reuenged on them.

<aside>In great troopes, and furie, & with sharpe though shorte force, and with special noise, to terrifie me, but in God I ouercame al.</aside>

<sup>13</sup> Being thrust I was ouerturned to fal: and our Lord re-ceiued me.

<aside>I was sometimes by vehemencie of tentation, declining to sinne: but Gods grace assisted and strengthened me.</aside>

<sup>14</sup> Our Lord is my strength, and my prayse: and he is made my saluation.

<sup>15</sup> The voice of exultation, and of saluation in the tabernacles of the iust.

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of our Lord hath wrought strength: the right hand of our Lord hath exalted me, the right hand of our Lord hath wrought strength.

[^1] The same word [right hand] thrise mentioned, signifieth the B. Trinitie. Also [Our Lord] signifying Christ in his humanitie the chief instrument of God, is here often repeted, to signifie the singular efficacie therof.

<sup>17</sup> I shal not die, but shal liue: and I wil tel the workes of our Lord.

<sup>18</sup> Our Lord chastising hath chastised me: and to death he hath not deliuered me.

[^2] God chastiseth his children, because he would not that they should dye eternally. So he punisheth as a father, not as an enimie.

<sup>19</sup> Open ye the gates of iustice to me, being entred into them <sup>20</sup> I wil confesse to our Lord: this is the gate of our Lord, the iust shal enter into it.

<aside>The Prophet now speaketh in the person of iust soules, requiring spiritual doctrin, and foode, and promising to serue God.</aside>

<sup>21</sup> I wil confesse to thee because thou hast heard me: and art become my saluation.

<sup>22</sup> The stone, which the builders reiected: the same is made into the head of the corner.

[^3] An euident prophecie of Christ vttered by the Royal Psalmist, and now confessed by euerie Christian, that our Sauiour reiected by the Iewes, is neuertheles the builder of his Church, by ioyning the two peoples of Iewes and Gentiles, as two walles into one house.

<sup>23</sup> This was done by our Lord: and it is meruelous in our eies.

<sup>24</sup> This is the day, which our Lord made: let vs reioice, and be glad therein.

[^4] God orday ned this acceptable time of grace.

<sup>25</sup> O Lord saue me, Ã´ Lord geue good successe: Blessed be he that cometh in the name of our Lord.

<aside>The songes of the Hebrew children, when Christ entered Ierusalem with palmes of triumph, and acclamations.</aside>
