<sup>8</sup> He is permanent for euer in the sight of God: his g mercie and h truth who shal require?

[^1] Who is able to vnderstand, or expresse how great Christs mercie is in redeeming vs, and his truth in performing his promised rewardes?

<sup>9</sup> So i wil I say a Psalme to thy name for euer and euer: that I may render my vowes k from day to day.

[^2] For so inestimable benefites, I wil alwayes praise thee with Psalmes, Canticles, or other thankes in this life: k and eternally in the life to come.

PSALME. LXI.

[^3] Exhortation to good life, in respect of reward, or punishment, the 7. key.

*A iust man encourageth his owne soule to serue God in sincere humilitie, 9. exhorteth also al others to trust in God, not in false and worldlie policies, or wealth, because Gods powre and mercie wil render to euerie one as they deserue.*

<sup>1</sup> Vnto the end, for a Iduthun a Psalme of Dauid.

[^4] Directed to Idithun, one of the masters of musike, to sing it, or to make tune for it.

<sup>2</sup> Shal b not my soule be subiect to God? for of him is my saluation.

[^5] The wicked threating to ruinate others, Dauid, or anie iust man, feareth them not, because his soule is subiect to God.

<sup>3</sup> For he is my God, and my sauiour: my receiuer c I shal be moued no more.

[^6] Therfore I firmely purpose neuer to be moued from God.

<sup>4</sup> How long set you violently vpon a man: e you al doe kil: as it were vpon f a wal, that is leaning, and a wal shaken.

[^7] In vaine do you my aduersaries stil assault me, though ye be al confederate to kil me; f supposing me to be like a ruinous, or shaken wal, that is easily throwne downe.

<sup>5</sup> But g yet they thought to repel my price, h I ranne in thirst: i they blessed with their mouth, and cursed with their hart.

[^8] They thinke stil to depriue me of my reward, the price of my labours and merites, h but I runne so much more diligently, as thirsting after righteousnes in this life, i and glorie in the next, to finish my course. A most dangerous tentation, when after threates and cruelties, persecutors endeuour by sweete wordes, and promises to perswade the iust to fal into sinne.

<sup>6</sup> But yet my soule be thou subiect to God: because my patience is from him.

<sup>7</sup> Because he is my God, and my sauiour: my helper k I shal not remoue.

[^9] I resolutly purpose not to yeld to anie tentation.

<sup>8</sup> In God is my saluation, and my glorie: the God of my helpe, and my hope is in God.

<sup>9</sup> Hope in him l al ye the congregation of people: powre out your harts before him, God is our helper for euer.

[^10] Gods faithful seruantes are not only constant themselues, but also exhorte and perswade al others, as much as in them lieth, to serue God and trust in him.
