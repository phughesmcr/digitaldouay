PSALME XVI.

*A iust mans prayer in tribulation, 5. describing his enemies crueltie, 13. by Gods prouidence protesting his innocencie, 15. and declareth his hope, that the iust shal be satisfied in glorie.*

<sup>1</sup> The " prayer of Dauid.

HEARE ô Lord my a iustice: attend my petition: with thine eares heare my prayer, b not in deceitful lippes.

<sup>2</sup> From c thy countenance let my iudgement procede: let thine eies see equities.

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast proued d my hart, and visited it e by night: f by fire thou hast examined me, g and there is no iniquitie found in me.

<sup>4</sup> That my mouth speake not the workes of men: for the h wordes of thy lippes I haue kept the i hard wayes.

<sup>5</sup> Perfite my pathes in thy pathes: that my steppes be not moued.

<sup>6</sup> I haue cried, because thou hast heard me ô God: incline thyne eare to me, and heare my wordes.

<sup>7</sup> Make thy mercies meruelous, which sauest them that hope in thee.

<sup>8</sup> From them that resist thy right hand keepe me, as the apple l of the eie:

<sup>9</sup> Vnder the shadowe of thy winges protect me: m from the face of the impious, that haue afflicted me.
