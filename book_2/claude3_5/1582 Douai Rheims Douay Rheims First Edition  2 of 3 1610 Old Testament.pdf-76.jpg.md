<sup>27</sup>Decline from evil, and doe good: and inhabite for euer and euer.

<sup>28</sup>Because our Lord loueth iudgement, and he wil not forsake his sainctes: they shal be preserued for euer.
The vniust shal be punished: and the seede of the impious shal perish.

<sup>29</sup>But the iust shal inherite the land: and shal inhabite for euer vpon it.

<sup>30</sup>The mouth of the iust shal meditate wisdome, and his tong shal speake iudgement.

<sup>31</sup>The law of his God in his hart: and his steppes shal not be supplanted.

<sup>32</sup>The sinner considereth the iust: and seeketh to murder him.

<sup>33</sup>But our Lord wil not leaue him in his handes: neither wil he condemne him, when iudgement shal be geuen of him.

<sup>34</sup>Expect our Lord, and keepe his way: and he wil exalt thee, that thou mayst inherite the land: when the sinners shal perish thou shalt see.

<sup>35</sup>I haue seene the impious highly exalted, and aduanced as the ceders of Libanus.

<sup>36</sup>And I passed by, and behold he was not: and I sought him, and his place was not found.

<sup>37</sup>Keepe innocencie, and see equitie: because there are remaynes for the peaceable man.

<sup>38</sup>But the vniust shal perish together: the remaines of the impious shal perish.

<sup>39</sup>But the saluation of the iust is of our Lord: and he is their protector in the time of tribulation.

<sup>40</sup>And our Lord wil helpe them, and deliuer them: and he wil take them away from sinners, and saue them: because they haue hoped in him.

PSALME XXXVII.

*King Dauid, or anie other penitent, earnestly prayeth God to remitte his sinnes, and mitigate the paines which he acknowledgeth him selfe to haue deserued, 12. lamenting the afflictions which he suffereth by such as were his freindes, 15. whose tentations he now resisteth, trusting in God.*

[^1]: In these two principles, declining fro euil and doing good, true iustice consisteth. *n* and he that finally obserueth these two pointes, meriteth and shal possesse heauen.
