<sup>8</sup> My eye is trubled for furie: I haue waxen old among al myne enemies.

<sup>9</sup> Depart from me al ye that worke iniquitie: because our Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.

<sup>10</sup> Our Lord hath heard my petition, our Lord hath receiued my prayer.

<sup>11</sup> Let al myne enemies be ashamed, & very sore trubled: let them be conuerted and ashamed very quicly.

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. VI.

[^1] 1. *For the octaue.*] Literally it semeth that the Psalmes which haue *octaue*, in their titles, were to be song on an instrument of eight stringes. So the Caldee paraphraseth: *With singing vpon the harpe of eight stringes*. But prophetically S. Augustin, & others expound it, to perteine to the Resurrection in the end of this world. So Dauid, and al penitent sinners bewaile their sinnes, and do penance in this life, for the octaue, that is for the world to come.

[^2] 1. *In thy fury, not in thy wrath.*] By *furie* is signified diuine iustice, irreuocably condemning the wicked to eternal torments: by *wrath*, Gods fatherlie chastisement correcting sinners, whom he loueth. Whereupon S. Gregorie teacheth, that the faithful soule not only feareth furie, but also wrath, because *after the death of the flesh, some are deputed to eternal torments, some passe light through the fire of purgation.* Which doctrine the same holy father confirmeth, by the iudgement of S. Augustin more ancient: Who likewise affirmeth, that al those which haue not laide Christ their fundation, are rebuked in furie, because they are tormented in eternal fire: and those which vpon right fundation of true faith in Christ haue built wood, hay, stubble, are chastised in wrath, because they are brought to rest of beatitude but purged by fire. Let therfore the faithful soule (considering what she hath done, and contemplating what she shal receiue) say: *Lord rebuke me not, in thy furie: nor chastise me in thy wrath.* As if she said more plainly: This only pray my whole intention of hart, I craue, this incessantly with al my desire I couete, that in the dreadful iudgement, thou neither strike me with the reprobate, nor afflict me with those, that shal be purged in burning flame. Thus S. Gregorie, *in 1. Psalm p≈ìnitent. v. 1.*

PSALME VII.

*Dauid in confidence of his iust cause, and vniust persecution, prayeth for Gods helpe, 7. and iust reuenge of his enemies: 15. describing their malicious intentions, and ruine.*

The Psalme of Dauid which he song to our Lord, for the <sup>1</sup> wordes of Chusi the sonne of Iemini: (2. *Reg. 16.*)
