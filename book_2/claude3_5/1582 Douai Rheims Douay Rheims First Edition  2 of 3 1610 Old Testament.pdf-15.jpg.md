PSALMES

PSALME I.

*The Royal prophet David placed this Psalme as a Preface to the rest, containing a true happines, which consisteth in flying sinnes, and serving God. 5. The good doe prosper, 5. not the wicked: 6. as wil appeare in the end of this world.*

<aside>Mat. 5.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> BLESSED <sup>a</sup> is the man, that <sup>b</sup> hath not gone in the counsel of the impious, & hath <sup>c</sup> not stoode in the way of sinners, and hath <sup>d</sup> not sitte in the chayre of pestilence: [^1]

<aside>Ios. 1.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> But <sup>e</sup> his wil is in the way of our Lord, and in his law he <sup>f</sup> shal meditate day and night. [^2]

<aside>Iere. 17.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> And he shal be as a tree, that is planted nigh to <sup>g</sup> the streames of waters, which shal geue his fruite in his time: [^3]

<sup>4</sup> And <sup>h</sup> his leafe shal not fal: and <sup>h</sup> al thinges whatsoeuer he shal doe, shal prosper. [^4]

<sup>5</sup> The impious not so: but <sup>i</sup> as dust, which the winde driueth from the face of the earth. [^5]

<sup>6</sup> Therfore the impious shal <sup>k</sup> not rise againe in iudgement: nor sinners in the <sup>l</sup> councel of the iust. [^6]

<sup>7</sup> For our Lord <sup>m</sup> knoweth the way of the iust, and the way of the impious <sup>n</sup> shal perish. [^7]
