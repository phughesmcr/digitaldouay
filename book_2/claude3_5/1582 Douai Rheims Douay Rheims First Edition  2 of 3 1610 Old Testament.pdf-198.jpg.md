<sup>4</sup>They wandered in the wildernes, in a place without water: the way of citie for habitation they found not.

[^1]: Literally of such as wander in this world, hauing no setled place to dwel in: spiritually of al mankind after his fal.

<sup>5</sup>Hungrie, and thirstie; their soule fainted in them.

<sup>6</sup>And they cried to our Lord when they were in tribulation: and he deliuered them out of their necessities.

<aside>When soeuer they cal vpon God, he heareth them, as is best for their spiritual health.</aside>

<sup>7</sup>And he conducted them in to the right way: to goe into a citie of habitation.

<sup>8</sup>Let the mercies of our Lord confesse to him: and his meruelous workes to the children of men.

[^2]: Al Gods benefites, which are of his mercie, not of mans desertes, are iust matter of praising God.

<sup>9</sup>Because he hath filled the emptie soule: and the hungrie soule he hath filled with good thinges.

<sup>10</sup>Them that sitte in darkenes, and in the shadow of death: bound in needines, and yron.

<sup>11</sup>Because they exasperated the wordes of God: and they prouoked the counsel of the Highest.

[^3]: Calamities in this world are commonly inflicted for sinnes.

<sup>12</sup>And their hart was humbled in labours: they were weakened, neither was there anie to helpe.

<sup>13</sup>And they cried to our Lord when they were in tribulation: and he deliuered them out of their necessities.

<sup>14</sup>And he brought them out of darkenes, and the shadow of death: and brake their bondes asunder.

<sup>15</sup>Let the mercies of our Lord confesse to him: and his meruelous workes to the children of men.

<sup>16</sup>Because he hath destroyed the gates of brasse: and the barres of yron he hath broken.

<sup>17</sup>He hath receiued them out of the way of their iniquitie: for they were humbled for their iniustices.

<sup>18</sup>Their soule did abhorre al meate: & they approched euen to the gates of death.

<sup>19</sup>And they crie to our Lord when they were in tribulation: and he deliuered them out of their necessities.

<sup>20</sup>He sent his word, and healed them: and deliuered them out of their destructions.

<sup>21</sup>Let the mercies of our Lord confesse to him: and his meruelous workes to the children of men.

And
