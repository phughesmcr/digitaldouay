<sup>1</sup> DELIVER me from mine enimies ô my God: and from them that rise vp against me defend me.

<sup>3</sup> Deliuer me from them that worke iniquitie: and from bloudy men saue me.

<sup>4</sup> Because loe they *b* haue taken my soule: the strong haue falne violently vpon me.

*b* They haue so sharply beseiged me, that it is now in their handes, to take away my life.

<sup>5</sup> Neither is it mine iniquitie, nor my sinne ô Lord: *c* without iniquitie haue I runne, and gone directly.

*c* Of my part I haue committed no fault against myne enimies, for which they can haue iust cause to persecute me.

<sup>6</sup> Ryse vp to meete me, and see: and thou ô Lord the God of powres, God of Israel attend to visite *d* al nations: haue *e* no mercie on al that worke iniquitie.

*d* The prophet foreseeing in spirite, that the Catholique Church shal be vniustly persecuted, prayeth, and teacheth others to pray, that God wil mercifully visite his faithful people of al nations: *e* and punish their obstinate persecuters.

<sup>7</sup> They wil returne *f* at euening: and they shal suffer famine *g* as dogges, and shal compasse the citie.

*f* Persecuters laboring how much, or how long soeuer, shal at night, that is, in the end of al their wicked endeuoures be vnfatisfied in their desires, *g* as hungrie dogges that runne hunting al the day, & night also, stil seeking & not finding wherewith to fil their rauenous mouthes and deuouring bellies.

<sup>8</sup> Behold they *h* wil speake in their mouth, and a sworde in their lippes: *i* because who hath heard?

*h* They threaten and determine to vse al crueltie, *i* as if there were no God, that heareth, and wil punish it.

<sup>9</sup> And thou ô Lord wilt scorne them: thou wilt bring to naught al the nations.

<sup>10</sup> I wil keepe my strength to thee: *k* because thou art my <sup>11</sup> receiuer: my God, thy mercie shal preuent.

*k* Though Gods grace the Church is stil strong and the vertuous do perseuere.

<sup>12</sup> God wil shew vnto me concerning mine enimies, kil them not *l* lest sometime my peoples forgete.

*l* God suffereth afflictions to fal vpon his seruants to kepe them exercised, lest in prosperitie they forgete their duties to him.

Disperse them in thy strength: and *m* depose them my protector ô Lord.

*m* Depriue them of powre, that they may not do so much euil as they desire.

<sup>13</sup> The sinne of their mouth, the word of their lippes: and let them be taken in their pride.

And
