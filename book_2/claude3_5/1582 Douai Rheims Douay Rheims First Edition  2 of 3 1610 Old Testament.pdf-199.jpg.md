OF PSALMES.

<sup>21</sup> And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and shew forth his workes in exultation.

<sup>23</sup> They that goe downe into the sea in shippes, making trafficke in the great waters.

<sup>24</sup> They haue sene the workes of our Lord, and his merueilous thinges in the depth.

<sup>25</sup> He said, and the blast of the storme stood: and the waues therof were exalted.

<sup>26</sup> They ascend euen to the heauens, and they descend euen to the depthes: their soule pyned away in euils.

<sup>27</sup> They were trubled, and were moued as a drunken man: and al their wisedom was deuoured.

<sup>28</sup> And they cried to our Lord when they were in tribulation, and he brought them out of their necessities.[^1]

<sup>29</sup> And he turned his storme into calme: and the waues therof were quiet.

<sup>30</sup> And they reioyced because they were quiet: and he conducted them into the hauen of their wil.

<sup>31</sup> Let the mercies of our Lord confesse to him: and his meruelous workes to the children of men.

[^2]

<sup>32</sup> And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and in the chayre of the ancientes let them praise him.

<sup>33</sup> He turned the riuers into a desert: and the issues of waters into drienesse.

[^3]

<sup>34</sup> The fruiteful land into salt ground, for the malice of them that inhabite it.

[^4]

<sup>35</sup> He turned the desert into pooles of waters: and the land without water into issues of waters.

<sup>36</sup> And he placed the hungrie there: and they built a citie of habitation.

[^1]: As before in the 6, 13, and 19, verses.

[^2]: This verse also is foure times in this Psalme v 8 15 21. and 31. to admonish vs, that as there is one meanes to escape from al dangers by crying to God, so v 6 13. 19. and 28; with mourning and penance: so there is one cause of praise and thankes for our deliuerie, which is Gods mercie and grace.

[^3]: God to shew sometimes his powre, also to benefite some, and to punish others, changeth the accustomed course of thinges, and state of men, as his diuine pleasure is: here the Royal prophet reciteth some examples. And some others are recorded in diuers times and places. No doubt much change was made in the earth by Noes flood. And manie thinkes that the land of Chanaan, was made more fruitful in the time of the Iewes inhabiting, and now is more barrane againe.

[^4]: He alludeth to the countrie about Sodome, and Gomorre, which was most fruitful, and most pleasant, Gen. 13. v. 10. but shortlie after was burnt with fire and brimston, Gen. 19. v. 24. subuerted, and turned into a dead and salt sea.
