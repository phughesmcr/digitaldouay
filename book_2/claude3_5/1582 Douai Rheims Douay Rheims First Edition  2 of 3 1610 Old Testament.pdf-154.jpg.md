<sup>16</sup> The enemies of our Lord have lied to him: and r their time shall be for ever.

[^1] The wicked that promise to serve God, and do it not shal be in eternal torments:

*In the meane time God inflicted these punishes upon them, for their infidelitie sake.*

PSALME LXXXI.

[^2] *The Prophet declareth, a, that God reprehendeth unjust Judges and Magistrates: premonisheth them of his severe & eternal punishment: 8. Wherto the prophet conforming his wil prayeth for the same.*

<sup>1</sup> A Psalme to Asaph.

God stood in the assemblie *a* of goddes, and in the middes he *b* iudgeth goddes.

[^3] The wordes of the prophet, admonishing al magistrates, that when they sitte in judgement, or determine anie cause, God who is there, and everie where present, *b* attendeth their processe: and therefore it behoveth them to be advised what they doe: even as if they heard God speaking as here foloweth:

<sup>2</sup> *c* How long judge ye iniquitie: and accept ye the persons of sinners.

[^4] The wordes of God, though not uttered sensibly, yet in effect intimated by his law, according wherto he wil procede in iudgement against uniust Judges.

<sup>3</sup> Judge ye for the needie and the pupil: iustifie ye the humble, and the poore.

<sup>4</sup> Take away the poore: and deliver the needie from the hand of the sinner.

<sup>5</sup> They *d* knew not, neither did they understand, they walke in darkenesse: *e* al the fundations of the earth shal be moued.

[^5] Such iudges procede in grosse ignorance, not caring to understand, but content to walke in darkenesse. *e* And so evil disposed, that you would thinke al upside downe, iustifying the wicked, and condemning the iust.

<sup>6</sup> I saide: Yow are *f* goddes, and the sonnes of the highest al.

[^6] For your office which you participate of me, you are certaine goddes upon earth.

<sup>7</sup> *g* But you shal die as men: and fal *h* as one of the princes.

[^7] But when you die you shal find that you are men, subiect to Gods iudgement. *h* yea your punishment wil be grevous, and importable for the mightie shal mightely suffer torments. sap. 6.

<sup>8</sup> *i* Arise Ã´ God, iudge the earth: *k* because thou shalt inherite in al the Gentiles.

[^8] Againe the wordes of the prophet praying God, *k* that sing he is Lord of al he wil iudge al.
