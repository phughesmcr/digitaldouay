PSALME. CIIII.

*The Israelites are exhorted to sing praises to God, 5. for his meruelous benefites towards Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, 13. whose particular familie, being then smal, went from Chanaan into Ã†gypt (17. whither Ioseph by Gods prouidence was caried before) there increased in number, 23. was persecuted, 26. deliuered by Moyses and Aaron, working manie great miracles, 36. protected, and fedde in the desert, 44. and finally possessed Chanaan.*

[^1]

a Alleluia.

a Alleluia signifieth more then Laudate Dominum, Praise ye our Lord. For by these two hebrew wordes, Allelu ia, the Prophet inuiteth al men to praise God, with gladnes, and iubilation, with hart, voice, and gesture, with instruments, and howsoeuer we are able. And therfore S. Ierom, S. Augustin, and al Catholique writers keepe the same wordes, and translate it not, neither in the titles of Psalmes, nor ordinarily in anie place of holie Scripture. This is the first Psalme that vseth it, and is the same Psalme in sense, and in good part of the wordes, which the royal Prophet made, and caused to be songe, when he brought the Arke of God from the house of Obededom into his owne house. 1. Par. 16. v. 8.

<sup>1</sup> CONFESSE ye to our Lord, and inuocate his name: shew forth his workes among the Gentiles.[^2]

<sup>2</sup> Chaunt to him, and sing to him: tel ye al his meruelous workes.

<sup>3</sup> Prayse ye him in his holie name: let the hart of them reioice that seeke our Lord.

<sup>4</sup> Seeke ye our Lord, and be confirmed: seeke e his face alwayes.[^3]

<sup>5</sup> Remember ye his meruelous workes, which he hath done: his wonders, and the iudgments of his mouth.

<sup>6</sup> The seede of Abraham, his seruantes: the children of Iacob his elect.

<sup>7</sup> He is the Lord our God: in d al the earth are his iudgements.

<sup>8</sup> He hath bene mindeful for euer of his testament: of the word, which he commanded e vnto a thousand generations.[^4]

<sup>9</sup> Which he disposed to Abraham: and of his oath to Isaac.

<sup>10</sup> And he appointed it to Iacob for a precept: and to Israel for an eternal testament.[^5]

[^1]: Gods special benefites towards the Iewes, the 4. key.

[^2]: For an exposition of this Psalme read the places quoted in the inner margin.

[^3]: How much more grateful is it now to God, that we celebrate the greater mysteries of the new Testament.

[^4]: His present helpe, not only in Israel, but in al the world.

[^5]: For euer, to the end of the world.
