OF PSALMES. 117

<sup>7</sup> They have searched iniquities: they have failed searching with scrutanie.

<aside>But as they have failed: so they shal stil faile, and be overreached in their bad counsels; as Achitophel. 2. Reg. 17.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> Man shal come to a deepe hart: and God shal be exalted.

<sup>9</sup> Childrens arrowes are made their woundes: <sup>10</sup> and their tongues are weakned against them.

<aside>God hath chosen the weake of this world to confound the strong.</aside>

Al that saw them were trubled: <sup>11</sup> and everie man feared:

<aside>much marveled, seing the wicked so punished.</aside>

And they shewed forth the workes of God: and they understood his doings.

<sup>11</sup> The iust shal reioice in our Lord, and shal hope in him, and al the right of hart shal be praised.

<aside>The iust shal be praised, for rightly serving God.</aside>

PSALME. LXIIII.

*God is rightly praised in Sion and Ierusalem (in his Church only) for his benefits bestowed and promised. 8. Vnto which also in the time of grace, al nations shalbe called.*

1 To the end, a Psalme of David, a Canticle of Ieremie, and Ezechiel, to the people of the transmigration, when they began to goe forth.

<aside>The seventie Interpreters seing David here prophecie of the peoples returne from Babylon, added the names of Ieremie and Ezechiel, who being in the captivitie, prophesied the same more largely. As likewise these and other Prophetes, foresaw in spirite, and more especially prophecied the going forth of al nations from Babylon, that is, forsaking Idolatrie, and embracing true Religion in the Church of Christ, S. S. Augustin, Eutymius, and others.</aside>

2 A hymne Ã´ God becometh thee in Sion: & a vow shal be rendered to thee in Ierusalem.

<aside>Not in Babylon, nor els where, but in the Church, praises and vowes are grateful to God.</aside>

3 Heare my prayer: al flesh shal come to thee.

<aside>Al nations shal know thee.</aside>

4 The wordes of the wicked have prevailed vpon vs: and thou wilt be propitious to our impieties.

<aside>The wicked are insolent in threatening, e but thou mercifully pardoning our sinnes, they shal not hurt vs.</aside>

5 Blessed is he, whom thou hast chosen, and taken: he shal dwel in thy courtes.

<aside>They are happie to whom thou hast prepared grace, and glorie.</aside>

6 We shal be replenished in the goods of thy house: holie is thy temple, mervelous in equitie.

<aside>The voice of the faithful, reioycing in the hope of eternal glorie. Rom. 5. h nothing polluted shal enter into heaven. Apo. 21.</aside>
