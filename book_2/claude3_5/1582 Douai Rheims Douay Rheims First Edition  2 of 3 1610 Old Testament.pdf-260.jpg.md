<sup>14</sup> Our Lord i lifteth vp al that fal: and setteth vp al that are bruised.

<sup>17</sup> Thou openest thy hand: and fillest k euerie liuing creature with blessing.

<sup>18</sup> Our Lord is iust in al his wayes: and holie in al his workes.

<sup>19</sup> Our Lord is neere to al that inuocate him: to al that inuocate him in truth.

<sup>21</sup> Our Lord keepeth al that loue him: and he wil destroy al sinners.

<sup>22</sup> My mouth shal speake the prayse of our Lord: and let al flesh blesse his holie name for euer, and for euer and euer.

ANNOTATIONS PSALME CXLIIII.

[^1] *I wil exalt thee*] As this Psalme is the first of the seuen, which conteyne more particular instruction of perpetually praising God: so it is the seuenth of those, which are composed in order of the Alphabet, to witte, the 24. 33. 36. 110. 111. 118. and this 144. Of which the three former want some letters: signifying (as Cassiodorus interpreteth) such in Gods Church, as sing his praises, but with some imperfections: the other foure haue the perfect Alphabet, signifying those, that sing Gods praises with perfect deuotion. Which only foure S. Ierom calleth Alphabetical Psalmes. *Epist. ad Paulam Vrbicam*, & *Præfat. in Lament*.

[^2] *Our Lord is faithful*] This verse is not now in the ordinarie Hebrew text, and therefore either the same is defectiue, or els this Psalme should seme not to be composed with a perfect Alphabet in the fountaine tongue: For here it wanteth the letter Nun. But seing S. Ierom counteth this one of the foure Alphabetical Psalmes, omitting the other three, which consist of vnperfect Alphabets, it is very probable that this verse was once in the Hebrew text, as both the Greek & Latin, which they annotated, appeareth, that there is no certaintie, to correct the Greek, or Latin Bible by the Hebrew, which is now extant, but rather by them that may be supplied, which the Hebrew wanteth.
