OF PSALMES

<sup>2</sup>O Lord my God I haue hoped in thee: saue me from al that persecute me, and deliuer me.[^1]

<sup>3</sup>Lest sometime he as a Lyon violently take my soule, whiles there is none to redeme, nor to saue.[^2]

<sup>4</sup>O Lord my God if I haue done this, if there be iniquitie in my handes;[^3]

<sup>5</sup>If I haue rendered to them that repayed me euils, let me worthely fall emptie from myne enemies.[^4]

<sup>6</sup>Let the enemie persecute my soule, and take it; and treade downe my life in the earth, and bring downe my glorie into the dust.[^5]

<sup>7</sup>Arise Lord in thy wrath: and be exalted in the coastes of myne enemies.[^6]

And arise ô Lord my God in the precept which thou hast commanded: <sup>8</sup>and a synagogue of peoples shal compasse thee.[^7]

And for it returne on high: <sup>9</sup>our Lord iudgeth peoples.[^8]

Iudge me ô Lord according to my iustice, and according to my innocencie vpon me.[^9]

<sup>10</sup>The wickednesse of sinners shal be consumed, and thou shalt direct the iust, which searcheth the hart and raynes ô God.[^10]

<sup>11</sup>My iust helpe is from our Lord, who saueth those that be right of hart.

<sup>12</sup>God is a iust iudge, strong, & patient: is he angrie euerie day?[^11]

<sup>13</sup>Vnlesse you wil be conuerted, he shal shake his sword, he hath bent his bow, and prepared it.[^12]

<sup>14</sup>And in it he hath prepared the vessels of death: he hath made his arrowes for them that burne.

<sup>15</sup>Behold he hath bredde with iniustice: he hath conceiued sorow, and brought forth iniquitie.[^13]

<sup>16</sup>He hath opened a pit, and digged it vp: and he is fallen into the diche, which he made.[^14]

<sup>17</sup>His sorow shal be turned vpon his head: and his iniquitie shal descend vpon his crowne.[^15]

<sup>18</sup>I wil confesse to our Lord according to his iustice: and wil sing to the name of our Lord most high.
