# THE BOOKE

[^1] OVR Lord God of reuenges: the God of reuenges hath <sup>1</sup> done freely.

[^2] :: A prayer of iust zele, <sup>2</sup> Be exalted thou that iudgest the earth: render retribution to the proude.

<sup>3</sup> How long shal sinners ô Lord: how long shal sinners glorie?

<sup>4</sup> Shal they vtter, and speake iniquitie? shal al they speake, that worke iniustice?

[^3] <sup>5</sup> Thy people ô Lord they haue humbled: and thine inheritance they haue vexed.

<sup>6</sup> The widow, and the stranger they haue slaine: and the pupilles they haue killed.

[^4] <sup>7</sup> And they haue saide: The Lord shal not see, neither shal the God of Iacob vnderstand.

<sup>8</sup> Vnderstand ye foolish in the people: and ye fooles be wise at sometime.

<sup>9</sup> He that planted the eare, shal he not heare? Or he that made the eie doth he not consider?

<sup>10</sup> He that chastiseth nations, shal he not rebuke: he that teacheth man knowledge?

<sup>11</sup> Our Lord knoweth the cogitations of men: that they be vaine.

[^5] <sup>12</sup> Blessed is the man, whom thou shalt instruct ô Lord: and shalt teach out of thy lawe.

<sup>13</sup> That thou maist geue him quietnes from the euil daies: til a pitte be digged for the sinner.

[^1]: God more commonly called the God of mercie (which vertue in him is aboue al his workes, Psal. 144) is also the God of reuenges, according to his iustice. 4 He proceedeth in iudgement resolutly, not depending, nor fearing, not respecting anie person, powre, dignitie, wisdome or other like qualitie, but their iust merites.

[^2]: A prayer of iust zele,

[^3]: Shal most wicked men stil be suffered to speake so insolently?

[^4]: Scarse anie Atheistes are so blind, as thus to thinke but manie sin next to behave themselues, as if God saw not, knew not, or at least cared not what they do.

[^5]: So vnpossible is it that God should be ignorant, or careles what men do, that he also knoweth and obserueth their most secret thoughtes.

<aside>Mitigate and temper his afflictions, that by patience and fortitude, the iust may perseuer, and not be ouerwhelmed.</aside>
