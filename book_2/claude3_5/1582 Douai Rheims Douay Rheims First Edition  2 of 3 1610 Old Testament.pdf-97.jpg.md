OF PSALMES.                                                27

<sup>1</sup> A Psalme *a* to Asaph.

<aside>a To be songe or tuned by Asaph a maister of musike.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> The God of goddes our Lord hath spoken: and he hath called the earth, from the rysing of the sunne euen to the going downe.

<aside>b God almightie, who is greater then are al falsly supposed goddes, or holie persons, that participating of his goodnes are called goddes (as Kinges, Priestes, Iudges) coming into this world in mans nature, calleth al men to saluation.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Out of Sion the beauty of his comelinesse.

<aside>c *The Church of Christ began in Sion.*</aside>

<sup>4</sup> God wil come *d* manifestly: our God and he wil not kepe silence. *e* Fire shal burne forth in his sight: and round about him a mighty tempest.

<aside>d Christ that came in humilitie, and more obscurely to suffer, and to redeme vs, wil come in maiestie, and manifestly to iudge. e Immediatly before the general iudgement, fire shal burne al transitorie thinges.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> He shal *f* cal the heauen from aboue: and *g* the earth to discerne his people.

<aside>h Which know that to kepe Gods commandments in folowing vertues, is aboue the obligation of external sacrifice.</aside>

[^1]: Gene signes in the firmament, v and in earth.

<sup>6</sup> Gather ye together his saincts vnto him: which ordaine his testament *h* aboue sacrifices.

<sup>7</sup> And the heauens shal shew forth his iustice: because God is Iudge.

<sup>8</sup> Heare Ã´ my people, and I wil speake: Israel, and I wil testi- fie to thee: God thy God am I.

[^2]: God instru- cteth his peo- ple.

<sup>9</sup> I wil not rebuke thee in thy sacrifices: and thy holocaustes *k* are in my sight alwayes.

[^3]: Sacrifices are gratefull to God.

<sup>10</sup> I wil *l* not take calues out of thy house: nor buckegoats out of thy flockes.

<aside>l but in regard that God needeth not these earthly thinges, he rather requireth a gratefull mind. For otherwise man can geue nothing to God: seing al that is in the whole world is Gods owne in proprietie</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Because al the wilde beasts of the woods be myne, the cattle in the mountaines and oxen.

<sup>12</sup> I haue knowne al the foules of the ayer: and the beauty of the fielde is with me.

<sup>13</sup> If I shal be hungrie, I wil not tel thee: for the round earth is myne, and the fulnes therof.

<sup>14</sup> Wil I eate the flesh of oxen? or wil I drinke the blood of bucke goats?
