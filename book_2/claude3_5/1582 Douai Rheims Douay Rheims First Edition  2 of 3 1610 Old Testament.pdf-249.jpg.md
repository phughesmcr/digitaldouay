OF PSALMES 249

<sup>1</sup> Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sate and wept: whiles we remembred Sion,

<aside>Nere the rivers in Chaldea; whereof Babylon was the head citie, & the Iewes remained mourning, remembring the holie cities and seruice of God, which had bene in Sion, wherof they were depriued in the captiuitie.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> On the willowes in the middes therof, we hanged vp our instruments.

<aside>Al their musical instruments, as hauing no vse of them.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Because there they that led vs captiue, demanded of vs wordes of songes.

<aside>Either in earnest, or in scorne the Chaldees willed them to sing, as they were accustomed in their countrie.</aside>

And they that led vs away: Sing ye an hymne to vs of the songes of Sion.

<sup>4</sup> How shal we sing the song of our Lord in a strange land?

<aside>They excused themselues, and refused to sing sacred Psalmes before prophane people, neither had they mind to sing in that their mourning state of captiuitie.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> If I shal forgette thee O Ierusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.

<aside>The people shew not only their feruent present desire to serue God in Ierusalem, but also their firme purpose still to desire the same, wishing that if they forgett, or lose this affection, their right handes, or what soeuer is most deere, or necessarie for them, may be forgotten, not considered, but suffered to perish.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Let my tongue cleaue to my iawes, if I doe not remember thee:

If I shal not set Ierusalem in the beginning of my ioy.[^1]

<sup>7</sup> Be mindful ô Lord of the children of Edom, in the day of Ierusalem:

<aside>The Idumeans incensed the Chaldees to be cruel against the Iewes, whereof they pray for iust reuenge, and withal the Psalmist prophecieth that it wil be reuenged, which Isaias also prophecieth, c. 21. v. 11. for their reioyceing in Ierusalems miserie.</aside>

That say: Rase it, rase it, euen vnto the foundation therof.

<aside>The voice of the Idumeans, inciting the Babylonians vtterly to destroy Ierusalem.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> Daughter of Babylon miserable: blessed is he, that shal repay thee thy payment, which thou hast payed vs.

<aside>A prophecie that the people of Babylon should also be punished, for their cruelitie against the Iewes, whereof Isaias likewise prophecieth c. 13.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> Blessed is he, that shal hold, and shal dash thy litle ones against the rocke.

<aside>God wil blesse, or reward them that shal seuerely afflict the Babylonians, not sparing their children. Morally he is blessed, that mortifieth his owne passions, cutteth of sinful motions, or punisheth venial sinnes, that they grow not strong within his soule, and so draw it to committe mortal sinne. S. Aug. hic &S. Greg.in fine expos. Psal. pœnit.</aside>
