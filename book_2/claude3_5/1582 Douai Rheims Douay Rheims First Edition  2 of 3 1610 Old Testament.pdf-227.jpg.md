OF PSALMES 217

<sup>103</sup> How sweete are thy wordes to my iawes, more then honie to my mouth!

<aside>An other fruict is the sweetnes, which the iust feeleth in his owne soule.</aside>

<sup>104</sup> By thy commandments I haue vnderstood: therefore haue I hated al the way of iniquitie.[^1]

Nun. Euerlasting.

<sup>105</sup> Thy word is a lampe to my feete, and a light to my pathes.

<aside>The word or law of God declared by Prophets, Pastors, or other Preachers is the ordinarie meanes for others to lerne, how to direct their wayes, and actions.</aside>

<sup>106</sup> I haue sworne, and haue determined to keepe the iudgements of thy iustice.

<aside>Such profession Gods people made in the old Law, in Circumcision, or at other times: Christians make it in Baptisme.</aside>

<sup>107</sup> I am humbled exceedingly O Lord: quicken me according to thy word.

<aside>Al that wil liue godly in Christ Iesus, shal suffer persecution. 2. Tim. 3. v. 12.</aside>

<sup>108</sup> The voluntaries of my mouth make acceptable Ã´ Lord: and teach me thy iudgementes.

<aside>Besides the commandments, the iust also offer voluntarie workes of supererogation, acceptable to God.</aside>

<sup>109</sup> My soule is in my handes alwaies: and I haue not forgotten thy law.

<aside>By this Hebrew prouerb is signified, that a iust mans temporal life is in continual danger, as the thing that is in ones hand, is readie to be laid by, put out of his hand, or to be by and by disposed of, or may forthwith fal from his hand.</aside>

<sup>110</sup> Sinners laid a snare for me: and I haue not erred from thy commandments.

<sup>111</sup> For inheritance I haue purchased thy testimonies for euer: because they are the ioy of my hart.

<sup>112</sup> I haue inclined my hart to doe thy iustifications for euer, for reward.

<aside>A most euident place, that the keeping of Gods commandments merite reward, and are rightly obserued in respect of reward.</aside>

Samech. Helpe.

<sup>113</sup> I haue hated the vniust: and I haue loued thy law.[^2]

<sup>114</sup> Thou art my helper, and protectour: and vpon thy word I haue much hoped.

[^1]: It brideth also iust hatred to sinne.

[^2]: Not anie mortal man is to be hated, in his person, but his iniquitie, by which he is an enimie to Gods law, which euerie iust man loueth.
