OF PSALMES 165

<sup>25</sup> And my truth, and my mercie with him: and in my name more folly in shall his horne be exalted.[^1]

<sup>26</sup> And I wil put his hand in the sea: and his righthand in the riuers.

<sup>27</sup> He shal inuocate me: Thou art my Father: my God, and the protector of my saluation.

<sup>28</sup> And I wil put him the firstbegotten, high aboue the kings of the earth.

<sup>29</sup> I wil kepe my mercie vnto him for euer: and my testament faithful to him.

<sup>30</sup> I wil put his seed for euer and euer: and his throne as the daies of heauen.

<sup>31</sup> But if his children shal forsake my lawe: and wil not walke in my iudgementes:

<sup>32</sup> If they shal profane my iustices: and not kepe my commandmentes:

<sup>33</sup> I wil visite their iniquities with a rod: and their sinnes with stripes:

<sup>34</sup> But" my mercie I wil not take away from him: neither wil I hurt in my truth:

<sup>35</sup> Neither wil I profane my testament: and the words that procede from my mouth I wil not make frustrate.

<sup>36</sup> Once I haue sworne in my holie, * if I lie to Dauid:

<aside>* I wil not lie.</aside>

<sup>37</sup> his seede shal continue for euer.

<sup>38</sup> And *m* his throne as the Sunne in my sight, and as the Moone perfect for euer: and a faithful witnesse in heauen.[^2]

<sup>39</sup> But" thou hast repelled and dispised: thou" hast differred thy Christ.[^3]

<sup>40</sup> Thou hast ouerthrowne the testament of thy seruant: thou hast profaned his sanctuarie on the earth.[^4]

<sup>41</sup> Thou hast destroyed al the hedges therof: thou hast made the firmament therof feare.

<sup>42</sup> Al that passe by the way haue spoiled him: he is become a reproch to his neighbours.

[^1]: Christ. Act. 13. v. 12.

[^2]: *m* Christ shal be as the sunne, *n* and as the perfect, or full moone. See the first Tome. page 716. S. Augustin also expoundeth th s verse in the Anagogical sense, of the iust after the Resurrection in glorie, where the soule shal be like the sunne, and the bodie, which now is mutable, shal be like the moone, not as now alwayes changing, but as the ful moone, alwayes perfect.

[^3]: God hauing promised al the aforesaid the prophet in the person of the weake, lamenteth that the contrarie shal happen as yet in the temporal kingdom

[^4]: Amongest manie pensiue thinges, this one word doth comforte vs, thy promise remaineth, thou hast not denied to send Christ, but differred him.
