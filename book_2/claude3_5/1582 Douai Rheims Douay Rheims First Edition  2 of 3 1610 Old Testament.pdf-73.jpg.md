and most hainous, and odious sinne. For which God often leauing them destitute of ordinarie grace, which he geueth to others, they fal into reprobate sense, and into more horrible sinnes.

<sup>5</sup> He hath meditated iniquitie in his bed: he hath set himselfe on euery way not good, and malice he hath not hated.

<sup>6</sup> Lord thy mercie is in heauen: and thy truth euen to the clowdes.

<aside>God doth not vterly shut vp his mercie from the most misful & wicked sinners, but geueth them sometimes good motions, and sufficient helpe, that they may repent, be iustified & saued, if they do not wittingly harden their owne hartes, and stil wilfully repel Gods grace. g For to God no sinner (who is most faithful) shal be wil become sinners, and receiue them into his fauour againe, whensoever they resoluing to serue him, repent and cease to sinne.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> Thy iustice as the hilles of God: thy iudgementes are great depth.

<sup>8</sup> Men & beastes thou wilt saue ô Lord: as thou hast multiplied thy mercie ô God.

<aside>Thou ô God that hast care of al creatures, not only of men but also of brute beastes, art euer readie of thy grace to saue both moderate men, in whom the light of reason remaineth, and also grosse senslese persons, which are become brutish like horse and mule or other beastes. i For so our Lord multiplieth his mercie.</aside>

But the children of men, shal hope in the couert of thy winges.

<aside>Yet with condition that senslese or brutish men, must become reasonable men; the children of men, not coltes, whelpes, pigges &c. k Sinners thus conuerted shal not only haue al necessaries in this life, as al liuing creatures haue in this world, but also shal hope of spiritual, heauenly, & eternal glorie prepared for Angels, and children of men. And therfore verses folowing.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> They shal be inebrated with the plentie of thy house: and with the torrent of thy pleasure thou shalt make them drinke.

<sup>10</sup> Because with thee is the fountaine of life: and in thy light we shal see light.

<sup>11</sup> Extend thy mercie to them that know thee, and thy iustice to them, that are of a right hart.

<sup>12</sup> Let not the foote of pride come to me: and let not the hand of a sinner moue me.

<aside>Lest anie impediment hinder the obtayning and possession of eternal reward, the iust must specially pray not to be infected with pride: m nor be ouercome by the forcible tentations of other sinners, by perswasion, nor euil example.</aside>

<sup>13</sup> There haue they fallen that worke iniquitie: they were expelled, neither could they stand.

<aside>The cause of angels, was pride, and mans sinne was by perswasion of the diuel. p neither of which could escape punishment.</aside>

PSALME. XXXVI.

*An exhortation not to enuie nor imitate the euil, who for most part prosper in this world, and are damned eternally: but to flee euil and doe good, duly considering that God diuersly permitteth and punisheth the wicked, and likewise comforteth and afflicteth the iust, al for their good.*
