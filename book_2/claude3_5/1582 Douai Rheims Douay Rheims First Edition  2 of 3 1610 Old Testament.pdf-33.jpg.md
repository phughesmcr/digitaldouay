<sup>3</sup> Al haue declined, they are become d vnprofitable together: there is not that doth good, no not one.[^1]

Their throte is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they did deceitfully, the poyson of aspes vnder their lippes.

Whose mouth is ful of cursing and bitternesse : their feete swift to sheed bloud.[^2]

<sup>4</sup> Destruction and infelicitie in their waies, and the way of peace they haue not knowen : there is no feare of God before their eies.[^3]

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XIII.

1. *No one.*] S. Paul by this place, and the like (Isai. 59. v. 7.) confirmeth his doctrin (Rom. 3.) that both the Iewes and the Gentils (meaning al mankind) were in this state, that none, no not one without the grace of Christ, were iust, nor could be iustified, nor saued by the law of Nature, nor of Moyses. Which proueth the necessitie of faith. But neither that only faith iustifieth, nor that the iustest are stil wicked, as Caluin and Beza falsly expound these Scriptures. For the Prophetes and S. Paul speake in these places of men before they be iustified, teaching that al mankind is once in sinne: and none could be iustified but by Christ. Neuerthelesse they teach also that men being iustified must, and may do good workes meritorious. And that their workes are not then reprobable. *For being made free from sinne* (saith the same Apostle to the Romans c. 6.) *and become seruants to God, you haue your fruit in sanctification, and the end life euerlasting*. Which point of doctrin, how man is iustified, S. Augustin excellently, & briefly explicateth (li. 3. de spiritu & lit. c. 9.) in these wordes: That we are iustified freely by his grace, is not that faith it self obtained not grace by preceding merites, but that the merites themselues are geuen by grace. Not that it is done without our wil, but by the law our wil is shewed weake,

[^1]: Without faith in Christ none had meritorious workes.

[^2]: These three verses being not in the Hebrew, nor Greke, yet are in the English, 39. 117. and are three distinct verses in other psalmes. 5. 9. & 35.

[^3]: They are wholy occupied in vexing others.

[^4]: The Prophet speaketh this in the person of God.

[^5]: With greedines to hurt the good. Not belie- uing in God, they feared Idols, that is, diuels: i who in dede can not hurt Gods seruants.

[^6]: Though innumerable be very wicked, yet some are iust. I mocked and derided those that trust in God.

[^7]: The Pro- phet wisheth, and withal prophecieth that Christ our Sauiour wil come, who is promised to Israel. Redemed man from the captiuitie of the diuel. o those that supplant vice p and contemplate God.
