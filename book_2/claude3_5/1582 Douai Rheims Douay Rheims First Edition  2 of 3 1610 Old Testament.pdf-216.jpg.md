# THE BOOKE

The third connection is:
Teth | Iod,
Bonum | Principium,
Good | Beginning,

Albeit we now could know al thinges which are written, yet we know but in <sup>1</sup>part, and in part we prophecie: for we see now by a glasse, in a darke sort, but when we shal be worthie to be with Christ, and that be like to Angels, then doctrine of bookes shal cease, and then we shal see face to face: the * Good Beginning, euen as he is.

[^1]: 1. Cor. 13.

<aside>* God in himself.</aside>

The fourth connection is:
Caph | Lamed
Manus | Disciplina, siue cordis.
The hande | Of discipline, or of hart.

The handes are vnderstood in worke, hart and discipline are vnderstood in sense or meaning, because we can not rightly doe anie thing, vnles we first know what thinges are to be donne.

The fift connection is:
Mem | Nun | Samech:
Ex ipsis | Sempiternum | Ad uxorium:
Of them | Euerlasting | Helpe:

This needeth not explication, for it is manifest as the light, that from Scriptures are eternal helpes.

The sixt connection is:
Ain, | The | Sade.
Fons, siue Oculus, | Oris | Iustiti√¶.
Fountaine, or Eye | Of the mouth | Of iustice,

According to that which we haue expounded in the fourth connection: that deedes and intention must concurre.

The seuenth connection which is last, in which number of seuen is also mystical vnderstanding:
Coph | Res | shin | Tau,
Voca io, | Capitis, | Dentium | Signa.
Vocation | Of the head, | Of teeth | Signes.

Distinct voice is produced by the teeth: & in these signes we come to the Head of al, which is Christ, by whom we haue accesse to the euerlasting kingdom. Or thus (not transposing the wordes) By vocation of Christ the Head, through distinct voice of signes (for wordes are signes shewing the mind) we are conducted to the eternal kingdom, the happines which al men desire.

What I pray thee (saith the holy Doctor) is more sacred then this mysterie, what more pleasant then this delight? What meate, & what honey are sweeter, then to know Gods wisdome, to enter into his secretest closet; to behold the sense of our Creator; and to teach the wordes of thy Lord God, ful of spiritual wisdom, which are derided by the wise of this world.

We must also diuerslie the reader, of the like discourses of ancient Fathers (ouer long to be here recited) concerning the manifold high praises of Gods Law: conteined in this Psalme, with frequent repetition of certaine Synonyma wordes (signifying the same thing, in al sentences, to witte: The Law of God, his Wayes, Testimonies, Commandments, Precepts, Statutes, Iustifications, Iudgements, Iustice, Equitie, Veritie, Wordes, Speaches, & Sermons, of which there is commonly one in euerie verse, an sometimes two or three in the same verse. But our English tongue hardly sufficing rightly to distinguish the three

[^2]: Most of these letters haue also other significations. And are diuersly explicated by S. Ambrose, S. Beda, and others. Whereby we may lerne (though we vnderstand no more) that hol Scriptures are ful of mysteries (as S. Ierom calleth this) and hard to be vnderstood.

<aside>Gods law especially commended in this Psalme. 14 Synonyma signifying the law of God.</aside>
