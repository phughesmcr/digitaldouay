I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.

<sup>4</sup> I have labored crying, my iawes are made hoarse: my eies have failed, whiles I hope in my God.

[^1] Our Lord sweat bloud for anguish in his prayer, and was not delivered from his Passion, neither are his servantes presently delivered from tribulations, but as is most to Gods honour and their owne good.

<sup>5</sup> They are multiplied above the heares of my head, that hate me without cause.

<aside>Iean. 5.</aside>

Mine enimies are made strong, that have persecuted me vniustly: a then did I pay the thinges that I tooke not.

[^2] Our Saviour who had no sinne, payde the ransom for al sinnes.

<sup>6</sup> O God thou knowest my foolishness: and mine offences are not hide from thee.

[^3] O God thou knowest, that this which semeth follie to worldlie men, is true wisdom; and though men charge me with offences, thou knowest that I am innocent.

<sup>7</sup> Let them not be ashamed vpon me, which expect thee 么 Lord, Lord of hostes.

[^4] Suffer not the weake to be scandalized in my passions.

Let them not be confounded vpon me that seeke thee, 么 God of Israel.

<sup>8</sup> Because for thee have I sustained reproch, confusion hath covered my face.

<sup>9</sup> I am become a forener to my brethren, and a stranger to the sonnes of my mother.

<sup>10</sup> Because the zele of thy house hath eaten me: and the reproches of them that reproched thee, fel vpon me.

<aside>Ioan. 2. Rom. 15.</aside>

[^5] The zele of seeking Gods honour, in propagating and aduancing his Church, is the cause of persecution. As were those that selte persecuted, which haue lesse godlie zele.

<sup>11</sup> And I covered my soule in fasting: and it was made a reproch to me.

[^6] The wicked do reproch those that mortifie themselves.

And I put hearie cloth my garment: & I became a parable to them. <sup>12</sup> They spake aganst me that sat in the gate; and they soong aganst me that dranke wine.

[^7] The great men and iudges, also the drunkards and rascalitie of the people.

<sup>14</sup> But I, *o* my prayer to thee 么 Lord: a time of thy good pleasure 么 God.

<aside>*But I direct* my prayer to thee.</aside>

[^8] In the multitude of thy mercie heare me, in the truth of thy salvation:

<aside>p Expecting the time of thy good pleasure.</aside>

<sup>15</sup> Deliver me out of the myre, that I stick not fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and from the depthes of waters.

[^9] tribulations.
