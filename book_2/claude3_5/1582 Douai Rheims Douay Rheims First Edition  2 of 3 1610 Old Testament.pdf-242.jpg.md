Let thine eares be intent, to the voice of my petition.

<sup>3</sup> If thou shalt observe iniquities O Lord: Lord who shal susteyne it?

<sup>4</sup> Because with thee there is propiciation: and for thy law I have expected thee O Lord.

[^1] For thy promises made in the law, that thou wilt remitte sinnes to the penitent, geue more grace to them that seeke it, and mitigate also the paines due for sinnes.

<sup>5</sup> My soule hath expected in his word: my soule hath hoped in our Lord.

<sup>6</sup> From the morning watch even vntil night: let Israel hope in our Lord.

[^2] The hope of penitents is like to the watches of the day time, from morning vntil night, which are more comfortable, then watches of the night:

<sup>7</sup> Because with our Lord there is mercie and with him plenteous redemption.

[^3] The greatest comfort is in Christ our Redemer, whose plentiful Redemption bringeth more abundance of grace.

<sup>8</sup> And he shal redeme Israel, from al his iniquities.

[^4] Christs Redemption being sufficient for al the world, is effectual only to true liuing members of the Catholique Church.

## PSALME CXXX.

*Anie iust soule in humble confidence offereth his innocencie, as a spiritual and grateful sacrifice to God, 3. exhorting al Gods seruants euer to hope in him.*

A gradual Canticle of David.

1 David by Gods special grace hauing a sincere minde towards al men, euen towards his enimies, and an humble hart, not desiring anie thing ambitiously, but al to the honour of God, proposeth his owne example, for others to imitate: that they may with him offer the sacrifice of humilitie, and innocencie vnto God, from whom al good thinges procede.

[^5] Al this with a thankful mind to God who gaue this grace.

LORD my hart is not exalted: neither are mine eies loftie. Neither haue I walked in great matters: nor in meruelous thinges aboue me.

<sup>2</sup> If I was not humbly mynded: but exalted my soule: As the weaned childe is toward his mother, so retribution in my soule.

[^6] As children after they are weaned come stil willingly to their mother, so doth the childe of God relie vpon Gods helpe, though he alwayes feele not the same sweetnes: & according to his demeanour herein, he expecteth reward.

<sup>3</sup> Let Israel hope in our Lord, from henceforth now and for euer.

[^7] King Dauid, or anie other being for his vertue aduanced, and rewarded by God, is a good example to moue others to do the like, so shal they receiue like reward.

[^1]: d For thy promises made in the law, that thou wilt remitte sinnes to the penitent, geue more grace to them that seeke it, and mitigate also the paines due for sinnes.

[^2]: e The hope of penitents is like to the watches of the day time, from morning vntil night, which are more comfortable, then watches of the night:

[^3]: f The greatest comfort is in Christ our Redemer, whose plentiful Redemption bringeth more abundance of grace.

[^4]: g Christs Redemption being sufficient for al the world, is effectual only to true liuing members of the Catholique Church.

[^5]: b Al this with a thankful mind to God who gaue this grace.

[^6]: c As children after they are weaned come stil willingly to their mother, so doth the childe of God relie vpon Gods helpe, though he alwayes feele not the same sweetnes: & according to his demeanour herein, he expecteth reward.

[^7]: e King Dauid, or anie other being for his vertue aduanced, and rewarded by God, is a good example to moue others to do the like, so shal they receiue like reward.
