PSALME CXVIII.

[^3]

GENERAL ANNOTATIONS
VPON THIS CXVIII. PSALME.

As this Psalme is longest in the whole Psalter, so it semeth to the ancient Fathers most profound in sense. And so much the harder to be vnderstood, because also the very hardnes thereof lieth hidden, which in diuers other Psalmes, and partes of holie Scripture easilie appeareth to the reader. But here the wordes being clere, and the sense also plaine and easie in some pointes of doctrine, yet the more diligence is imployed, the more difficultie is found in searching the whole sense and meaning of euerie word and sentence, with the maner obserued in composing it, and the frequent repetition of the same or like wordes. Al which maturely considered caused that great Clerke, and light of the Church S. Augustin, to omite this Psalme, when he explicated al the rest. And when at last he added also this, he wittingly omitted one special difficultie, which he doubted not, to be conteined in the maner of composing it, not only by order of the Hebrew Alphabet, as diuers more Psalmes, and some other partes of holie Scripture, but more artificially then anie other, the first eight verses al beginning with the first letter Aleph; the next eight, with the second letter Beth: and so to the last of the two and twentie letters. Of which omission he yeldeth this only reason, because he found nothing (as he humbly affirmeth) that might properly perteine thereunto. Confessing also moreouer that whensoeuer he applied his cogitations to expound the text it self, it alwayes exceded his habilitie. But finally to satisfie the often and earnest request of his bretheren and freindes, trusting (as alwayes) in Gods special helpe, he largely expoundeth it, in thirtie two distinct Sermons.

[^1]: This was fulfilled when Christ was brought with bowes of palme, and other signes of triumph, from Bethania, through the whole citie, euen into the Temple and vnto the Altar: Mat. 21.

[^2]: Our first, chiefe, and final dutie is to praise God. v. 1. & vlt.

[^3]: *Perfect iustice is in keping Gods law: the 7. key.*

<aside>A perpetual recommendation of the singular excellencie, absolute necessitie, and eternal beatitude profite of Gods law: with frequent aspirations to perfection, hatred of sinne, loue of vertue, and feruent desire to rest in God.</aside>

<aside>The obscuritie of this profound Psalme appeareth not to the vulgar reader.</aside>

<aside>S. Augustin differed the exposition of this Psalme.</aside>

<aside>Om'ted to discusse one difficultie.</aside>

<aside>Also made 32. Sermons in explication therof.</aside>
