OF PSALMES. 63

Psalme which is therefore intitled *understanding: or, instruction of David*. It teacheth us also to understand, and to know, saith S. Augustin, that we must neither trust in our owne merites, nor presume to escape punishment of sinne. Thy first understanding therefore or lesson, must be, to know thy self to be a sinner. The next: is, that when with faith thou beginnest to worke wel by loue, thou attribute not this to thyn owne strength, but to the grace of God.

<aside>In epist. ad Ro. c. 4.</aside>

1. *Blessed [are they] whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are couered.*[^1] Calvin and his complices pervert this place, denying that sinnes are truly taken away, but only couered, and still remaine in the iustified. Which sense would make this Scripture contrarie to other places. Isaie 6. thyn iniquitie shal be taken away, and thy sinne shal be cleansed. Ioan. 1. The lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world. Act. 3. Be penitent and conuert, that your sinnes may be put out. 1. Cor. 6. you are washed, you are sanctified, you are iustified. & the like, which shew the true real taking away of sinnes, true sanctification, and iustification. As S. Ierom (or some other ancient authentical autor) explicateth this place saying: Sinnes are so couered by baptisme & penance, that they are not to be reuealed in the day of iudgement. *ne imputed* to him that diligently purgeth him selfe in this world, or by martyrdom. S. Augustin teacheth the same, saying: Sinnes are couered, are wholy couered. Neither must you vnderstand (saith he) that sinnes are couered, as though stil they were, and liued. Why then did the prophet say, sinnes are couered? they are not to be sene. More clerly, lib. 1. c. cont. duas Epist. Pelag. The Pelagians calumniating Catholiques, as if they taught, that sinnes are not taken away, but shauen, as heares are cut with a rasor, the rootes remaining in the flesh: *which the Apostle* (saith Augustin) *hath an impious sense*. Likewise S. Gregorie teacheth, that a sinner couereth his sinnes wel, when with contrarie vertues he ouerwhelmet former vices, and with good deedes blotteth out former euil deedes. He couereth them euil, when either for shame, or feare, or obstinatie, or desperation he concealeth his sinnes, omitting to confesse them. God couereth sinnes, as a phisition couereth woundes, by applying medicinal plaisters, which in deede cureth them. Thus ancient, lerned holie Fathers expound this text. Further explicating, that albeit sinnes couered, and not to them imputed, in effect remaine as they were before they were hid, yet whatsoeuer is hid to God, is in dede vtterly taken away, for nothing that is, can be hid from God. And the contrarie doctrin of Protestants is iniurious either to Gods power, if they say he can not quite take away sinnes, or to his mercie, if he wil not, or to his iustice, if he neuer punish sinnes remitted, and to his truth if he repute otherwise, then in deede the thing is. It is iniurious to Christ, to say, his bloud and death is not effectual to take away sinnes. iniurious to innumerable places of holie Scripture, which affirme plainly that sinnes by Gods grace are vtterly taken away. Finally it is iniurious to Sainctes in heauen, arguing them as ful of sinnes, if in deede sinnes yet remaine in them: which is most absurde, and blasphemie to speake. And yet followeth by necessarie consequence. For if the iustest liued & died in sinne, they should remaine eternally in sinne.

2. *Neither is there guile in his spirit*. In remission of sinnes the penitent necessarily must so cooperate, that he haue no guile in his spirite, or hart, for if he hate not his sinne of his fordaide blassedness, and his iniquities are not forgoten, nor his sinnes couered to God, but to be imputed and punished. Yet the repentance of a sinner be it neuer so sincere, hath not this guile doth not merite remission of sinne, but only disposeth therto. But after remission it is

[^1]: Sinne must be punished.

[^2]: Good workes are of grace.

[^3]: Protestantes expound this place contrary to many other clere places.

[^4]: Contrarie to the exposition of ancient fathers.

[^5]: God couering sinne doth quite take them away.

[^6]: The contrarie doctrin is iniurious to God: to Christ, to holie Scripture, to glorified Sainctes.

[^7]: Sincere repentance is a necessarie disposition to remission of sinne.
