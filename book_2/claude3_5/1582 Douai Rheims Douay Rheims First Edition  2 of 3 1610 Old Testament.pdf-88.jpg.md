<sup>22</sup>Wil not God enquire of these thinges? For he knoweth the secretes of the hart.

<sup>23</sup>Because for thee we are killed al the day: we are esteemed as sheepe of slaughter.

[^1] A prayer in affliction.

<sup>24</sup>Arise why sleepest thou ô Lord? Arise, and expel vs not to the end.

<sup>25</sup>Why dost thou turne away thy face, forgettest our pouertie and our tribulation?

<sup>26</sup>Because our soule is humbled in the dust: our bellie is glewed in the earth.

<aside>We are as dead; dore, readie to become dust. & lying as groveling soroving on the earth:</aside>

<sup>27</sup>Arise Lord, helpe vs: and redeme vs for thy name.

[^2] til thou deliuer vs from these tribulations.
