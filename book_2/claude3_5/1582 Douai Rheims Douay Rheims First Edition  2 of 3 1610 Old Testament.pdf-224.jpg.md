<sup>67</sup>Before I was humbled I offended: therefore have I kept thy *word*.

<sup>68</sup>Thou art good: and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.

<sup>69</sup>The iniquitie of the proud is multiplied vpon me: but in al my hart wil search thy commandments.

[^2]

<sup>70</sup>Their hart is crudded together as milke: but I have meditated thy law.

[^3]

<sup>71</sup>It is good for me that thou hast humbled me: that I may learne thy justifications.
