OF PSALMES. 109

<sup>6</sup> Be exalted aboue the heauens 么 God: and thy glorie vpon al the earth.

<sup>7</sup> They prepared a snare for my feete: and bowed downe my soule.

They / digged a pit before my face: and they are falne into it.

<aside>Saul endeuored manie wayes to ouerthrow Dauid, amongst other meanes prouoked him to flee vpon the Philistims, thinking they should haue slaine him, 1. Reg. 18. v. 17. but the same Philistims ouerthrew Saul. 1 Reg 31.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> My hart is readie 么 God, my hart is readie: I wil sing, and say a Psalme.[^1]

<sup>9</sup> Arise my glorie, arise psalter and harpe: I wil arise early.

<sup>10</sup> I wil confesse to thee among m peoples 么 Lord: and I wil say :: a Psalme to thee among n the Gentiles.[^2]

<aside>m Gods benefites bestowed vpon Dauid, and vpon faithful Christians prefigured by him, are for euer to be praised by al peoples and nations.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Because thy mercie is magnified euen to the heauens, and thy truth euen to the cloudes.

<sup>12</sup> Be exalted aboue the heauens 么 God: and thy glorie vpon al the earth.

PSALME. LVII.

*Holie Dauid inueigheth against dissembling wicked men. 7. describeth Gods prouidence in suffering euil, 11. wherin the iust shal be comforted.*[^3]

<sup>1</sup> Vnto *a* the end, *b* destroy not, to Dauid in; *c* the inscription of the title.

<aside>a This Psalme was made vpon the same occasion, and to the same purpose as the former, b to exhorte the iust and innocent to patience, c by Dauids memorable example.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> IF *d* in very dede you speake iustice: iudge right thinges ye sonnes of men.

<aside>d Few are so wicked, but they speake and pretend iust thinges:</aside>

<sup>3</sup> For in *e* the hart you worke iniquities: in the earth your *f* handes forge iniustice.

<aside>e but neither thinke wel, f nor do wel, but both contrarie, which feaned sanctitie is duble iniquitie.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Sinners are alienated from the matrice, they haue erred from the wombe: they haue spoken false thinges.

<aside>g These wicked sinners that flatter and incite king Saul, seme to haue spent al their life from their infancie in malice.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> They haue furie according to the similitude of *h* a serpent: as of the aspe that is deafe, and stoppeth his eares.

<aside>h Their furie is vnquiet, til they may wound the innocent with their poisonful sting, i neither wil they harken to good admonitions, but stoppe their eares like an aspe, that layeth one eare close to the ground, and stoppeth the other with his taile.</aside>

[^1]: The Psalmes more in vse with Christian Gentils, then they were with the Iewes. See pag. 12.
