<sup>18</sup>But I am a begger, and poore: Our Lord is careful of me.

[^1] Christ speaketh in the name of sinners truly repenting, whose sinnes he vndertaketh to redeme, and wath away by his passion.

Thou art (my helper, & my protector:my God be not slacke.

[^2] The faithful of the old testament pray for Christs first coming into this world, and the faithful now pray for his second coming to purge his Church, and to reward the good.

PSALME XL.

<aside>The prophet pronounceth them happie that wil beleue in Christ, coming in humilitie and pouertie. 5. Christ describeth his owne poore afflicted state in this life, by reason he is to satisfie for the sinnes of the world: the malice of his aduersaries, 10. specially of Iudas, 11. and by way of prayer, prophecieth his owne Resurrection.</aside>

<sup>1</sup>Vnto a the end, a Psalme to Dauid him selfe.

[^3] Perteyning to the new testament, as appeareth by the 10. verse alleaged by our Sauiour. This Psalme is also applied by the Church in the office of the sick, whom whosoeuer assisteth in that case, may hope to receiue assistance in their owne necessities.

<sup>2</sup>BLESSED is the man that vnderstandeth concerning b the needie, and the poore: in c the euil day our Lord wil deliuer him.

[^4] He is happie that is not scandalized in Christ (Luc. 7. v. 23.) coming in pouertie, and suffering extreme afflictions. c He that trusteth in Christ, notwithstanding the contrarie motives of this worldlie miserie, shal be deliuered by him in al distresse.

<sup>3</sup>Our Lord d preserue him, and geue him life, and make him blessed in the land: and e deliuer him not vnto the wil of his enemies.

[^5] Our Lord wil geue such seruantes more grace in this life, and glorie in the next. e not suffer him to be ouercome in tentations.

<sup>4</sup>Our Lord helpe him f vpon the bed of his sorow: thou hast turned al his couche in his infirmitie.

[^6] When such constant seruantes are sick to death, Christ wil most specially comforte and helpe them.

<sup>5</sup>I said: g Lord haue haue mercie on me: heale my soule, because I haue sinned to thee.

[^7] Christ in the behalf of his mystical bodie confesseth their sinnes, and prayeth for them.

<sup>6</sup>Mine enemies haue spoken euils to me: When shal he die, h and his name perish?

[^8] After death suffered for mankind Christ riseth, and his name and kingdom is glorious.

<sup>7</sup>And if i he came in to see, he. spake vayne thinges: his hart hath gathered together iniquitie to him selfe.

[^9] Those that came not of good wil, but of malice to obserue Christs deedes and wordes, carped at both, sometimes saying he taught against the law, and against Moyses; sometimes that he cast out diuels in the power of Beelzebub.
