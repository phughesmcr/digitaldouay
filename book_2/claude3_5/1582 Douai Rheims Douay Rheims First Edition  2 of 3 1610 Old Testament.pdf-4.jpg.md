PROEMIAL ANNOTATIONS

not diuers authores, but signifieth other thinges, either perteyning to the same persons, or by interpretation of their names, belonging to the present matter, as our Lord inspired him. Likewise S. Chrysostome resolutely iudgeth, that only King Dauid was author of this whole Booke. Moued especially by this argument, for that Christ and the Apostles alleaging the Psalmes, do oftentimes name Dauid as author, and neuer any other. Also Origen, S. Basil, S. Ambrose, S. Hilarie, Theodoretus, Cassiodorus, Beda, Eutimius, and most part of ancient and late writers, with the most common voice of Christians, cal this booke the Psalmes of Dauid: and the General Councels of Carthage, Florence, and Trent, in the Cathologue of Canonical Scriptures recite this booke, by the name of Dauids Psalter.

Neither were Asaph, Eman, and Idithun anie where called Prophetes (as are al the writers of holie Scriptures) but only masters of musike, *1. Paral. 25.* And the sonnes of Core were only porters: *1. Paral. 26.* Finally S. Ierom (whose iudgement the whole Church singularly esteemeth, in al questions belonging to holie Scriptures) semeth as much inclined, that only the Royal Prophet Dauid was author of this whole booke, as to the contrarie. For in his Epistle to Paulinus, prefixed before the Latin Bible, comprehending the principal arguments of seueral bookes, when he cometh to the Psalmes, without mention of other authors, saith: *Dauid our Simonides, Pindarus, and Alceus, Flaccus also, Catullus, and Ce-*
