OF PSALMES. 105

<sup>6</sup> Feare and trembling are come vpon me: and darkenes hath couered me.[^1]

<sup>7</sup> And I said: Who wil geue me wings as of a doue, and I wil fly: and rest?

<sup>8</sup> Loe I haue gone far flying away: and I abode in the wildernes.

<sup>9</sup> I expected him that saued me from pusillanimitie of spirit, and tempest.[^2]

<sup>10</sup> Precipitate Ã´ Lord, and q diuide their tongues: because I haue sene r iniquitie, and s contradiction in the citie.[^3]

<sup>11</sup> Day and night shal iniquitie compasse it vpon the walles therof; and t labour in the middest therof, and v iniustice.[^4]

<sup>12</sup> And there hath not ceased out of the streetes therof vsurie, and guile.[^5]

<sup>13</sup> For x if myne enimie had spoken euil to me, I would verely haue borne it.[^6]

And if he that hated me had spoken great thinges vpon me: I would perhaps haue hid myselfe from him.

<sup>14</sup> But y thou a man of the same minde: my z guide, and my familiar.[^7]

<sup>15</sup> Which diddest a take swete meats together with me, in the b house of God we walked with consent.[^8]

<sup>16</sup> Let death come vpon them: and let them goe downe quicke into hel.[^9]

Because there is wickednes in their habitations, in d the middes of them.

<aside>I haue scarse sense, or discourse of reason, being almost overwhelmed with troubles.</aside>

<aside>I would God I could flie, that in the simplicitie of a doue, I might spedely passe away from these afflictions.</aside>

<aside>I haue fled so farre as I could from troubles:</aside>

<aside>for the rest I remitted to Gods wil and good pleasure, m and he suffered me not to be ouer. throwne, n though I am weake, o and the tentations are great.</aside>

<aside>O God abate the pride of arrogant persecuters, q suffer them not to agree amongst them selues. r They are ful of al iniquitie, s they haue also contentions among themselues, t unto the same to our good.</aside>

<aside>With their continual great iniquitie, they haue their troubles, v but leaue not their iniustice.</aside>

<aside>They are stil vsuers, and deceitful oppressors of the poore.</aside>

<aside>It is a greater griefe to suffer iniuries of those that seme to be freindes.</aside>

<aside>A man that was, or semed of the same mind, faith, and religion, z whom I so trusted, that I would haue gone, whithersoeuer he should haue ledde me.</aside>

<aside>Thou diddest participate the same holie sacraments with me, b in the Catholique Church;</aside>

<aside>As Core & his complices: spoken of iust zele, not of desire to reuenge: verified in those that sinne wittingly and knowing, for they descend, as it were, aliue into hel.</aside>

<aside>The whole crew of the wicked conspire in iniquitie.</aside>
