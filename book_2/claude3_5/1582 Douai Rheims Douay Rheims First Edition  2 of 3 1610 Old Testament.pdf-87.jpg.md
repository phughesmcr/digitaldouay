OF PSALMES. 87

<aside>Isa. 24.
1.Re.17.
2.Re.8.8.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> For I wil not hope in my bowe: and my sword wil not saue me.

<sup>8</sup> For thou hast saued vs from them that afflict vs: and them that hate vs thou hast confounded.

<sup>9</sup> In God we shal be praysed al the day: and in thy name we wil confesse for euer.

<sup>10</sup> But *h* now thou hast repelled and confounded vs: and thou wilt not goe forth ô God in our hostes.

[^1]

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast turned vs backe behind our enemies: and they that hated vs, spoyled for themselues.

<sup>12</sup> Thou hast geuen vs as sheepe that are to be eaten: and thou hast dispersed vs among the nations.

[^2]

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast sold thy people *k* without price: and there was *l* no multitude in the exchanges of them.

[^3]

<sup>14</sup> Thou hast made vs a reproche to our neighbours, a scorne and mocking stocke to them, that are round about vs.

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast made vs for a parable to the Gentiles: a wagging of the head among the peoples.

<sup>16</sup> Al the day my shame is against me, and the confusion of my face hath couered me.

<sup>17</sup> At the voyce of the vpbrayder, and the reprocher: at the face of the enemie and persecutor.

<sup>18</sup> Al these thinges haue come vpon vs, *m* neither haue we forgotten thee: and we haue not done wickedly in thy testament.

[^4]

<sup>19</sup> And our hart hath not reuolted backward: and *n* thou hast declined our pathes from thy way:

[^5]

<sup>20</sup> Because thou hast humbled vs in the place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath couered vs.

<sup>21</sup> *o* If we haue forgotten the name of our God, and if we haue spred forth our handes to a strange God:

[^6]

[^1]: *h* The prophet foretelleth that after prosperitie God would suffer the Iewes to falle into captiuitie, & manie afflictions, which also signified allegorically diuers states of Christs Church.

[^2]: *i* The Iewes are now meruelously dispersed, and depressed.

[^3]: *k* without price: *l* In the destruction of Ierusalem the remnant of the people were sold for smal, as it were for no price. They had sold Christ for thirtie pence; and now no multitude, nor number of money at al was geuen for them, but thirtie of them were sold for one pennie, Iosephus de bello Iudaico.

[^4]: *m* Vntil Christs passion the Iewish people did not wholly fall from God, and true religion. And of them were chosen the Apostles, and manie others, that founded and propagated the Church of Christ.

[^5]: *n* The negatiue particle is here vnderstood by zeugma, according to the hebrew thus: our hart hath not reuolted backward, neither hast thou suffered our pathes to decline frõ thy way.

[^6]: *o* An other hebrew phrase, If we haue, for, we haue not.
