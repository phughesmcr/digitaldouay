bring to our Lord ye families of Gentiles, bring yeto our <sup>7</sup> Lord glorie and honour: <sup>8</sup> bring to our Lord glorie vnto his name.

Take vp hostes, and enter into his courtes: <sup>9</sup> adore ye our Lord in his holie court.

Let al the earth be moued before his face: <sup>10</sup> say ye among the Gentiles that our Lord hath reigned.

[^1] For he hath corrected the round world which shal not be moued: he wil iudge peoples in equitie.

<sup>11</sup> Let the heauens be glad, and the earth reioyce, the sea be moued, and the fulnesse therof: <sup>12</sup> the fieldes shal be glad, and al things, that are in them.

[^2] Then shal the trees of the woodes reioyce <sup>13</sup> before the face of our Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh to iudge the earth.

He [^3] wil iudge the round world in equitie, and peoples in his truth.

PSALME XCVI.

*The last iudgement, the 9. key.*

*Al the earth is inuited to reioyce in Christs kingdom, 3. with description of the signes coming before the day of Iudgement. 7 Idolaters shal be confounded. 8. Holie Angels and iust men shal adore Christ, and reioyce.*

To a this Dauid, *b* when his land was restored agane to him. 1

[^4] OVR Lord hath reigned, let the earth reioyce: let c manie Ilandes be glad.

[^5] Cloude,

[^1]: Diuers ancient Doctors read more in this place: Our Lord hath reigned from the wood, to witte, Christ by his death on the crosse conquered the diuel, sinne, and death, and thence began to reigne. S. Iustinus Martyr, dialogo aduerf. Tryphonem. Tertullian li. aduerf. Iudaeos. c. 10. & 13. aduerf. Marcionem. li. 3. c. 19. & 21. S. Augustin in this place, according to the old Roman Psalter. Before him Arnobius, and after him Cassiodorus and others, whereby it is probable, that it was sometimes in the Hebrew text, and blotted out by the Iewes.

[^2]: The Psalmist in abundance of spirite inuiteth al creatures to praise God, as Daniel in his Canticle. c. 3.

[^3]: Christ iudgeth now in the world by his ministers discerning and deciding causes, rewarding and punishing, but especially he wil iudge al in the last day.

[^4]: In figure of Christ, *b* whose bodie rose the third day after his death: to whom manie returned beleuing in him after his resurrection, which fel from him in his passion: and to whom al things shal be subdued, as to their true Lord, in the day of iudgement.

[^5]: Holie Dauid, and other Prophetes hauing great ioy to see long before in spirite only, Christs kingdom extended in the whole earth, yea to the Ilandes, we likewise haue great cause to be gladde, that God hath not only so blessed vs long since, but as yet conserueth seede, whereby we trust the whole Iland shal be againe restored vnto him.
