<sup>2</sup> Heare o Lord the voice of my petition whiles I pray to thee: whiles I lift vp my handes to thy holie temple.

<sup>3</sup> Draw me not together with sinners: and with them that worke iniquitie destroy me not.[^1]

which speake peace with their neighbour, but euils in their hartes.

<sup>4</sup> Geue them according to their workes, and according to the wickednesse of their inuentions.[^2]

According to the workes of their handes geue vnto them: render them their retribution.

<sup>5</sup> Because they haue not vnderstood the workes of our Lord, and in the workes of his handes thou shalt destroy them, and not build them vp.[^3]

<sup>6</sup> Blessed be our Lord: because he hath heard the voice of my petition.

<sup>7</sup> Our Lord is my helper, and my protectour: in him my hart hath hoped, and I was holpen.

And my flesh florisched againe: and with my wil I wil confesse to him.[^4]

<sup>8</sup> Our Lord is the strength of his people: and he is the protector of the saluations of his annoynted.[^5]

<sup>9</sup> Saue thy people o Lord, and blesse thine inheritance: and rule them, and extol them for euer.
