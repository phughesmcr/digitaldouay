OF PSALMES. 135

<sup>22</sup> Because my hart is inflamed, and my reynes are changed:
<aside>Almost burned up with affliction.</aside>

<sup>22</sup> And I am brought to nothing, and knew not.

<sup>23</sup> As a beast am I become with thee: and I alwaies with thee.
<aside>Charged with heauie burdens, without knowlege how long, or to what end, yet not destitute of thy protection.</aside>

<sup>24</sup> Thou hast helde my right hand: and in thy wil thou hast conducted me, and with glorie thou hast receiued me.

<sup>25</sup> For what is to me in heauen and besides thee what would I vpon the earth?
<aside>Nothing to be desired in heauen, nor in earth but God.</aside>

<sup>26</sup> My flesh hath fainted, and my hart: God of my hart, and God my portion for euer.
<aside>In bodie and mind I thirst after thee, my true inheritance.</aside>

<sup>27</sup> For behold, they that make them selues farre from thee, shal perish: thou hast destroyed al, that fornicate from thee.
<aside>Men by their freewil make themselves enimies to God. & determined their damnation, forsaking their final sinnes.</aside>

<sup>28</sup> But it is good for me to cleaue to God: to put my hope in our Lord God:
That I may shew forth al thy prayses, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
