THE BOOKE

suffeth to make them his bretheren, which vnderstand the mysterie of his Crosse, and not only are not ashamed therof, but also faithfully glorie therin.

<sup>2</sup> O Lord the God of my saluation: d in the day haue I cried, and in the night before thee.

[^1]

<sup>3</sup> Let my prayer enter in thy sight: incline thine eare to my petition.

<sup>4</sup> Because my soule is replenished with euils: and e my life hath approched to hel.

[^2]

<sup>5</sup> I am accounted with them that descend into the lake.

[^3]

<sup>6</sup> I am become as a man without helpe, <sup>g</sup> free among the dead, as the wounded sleeping in the sepulchres, of whom thou art mindeful no more: and they are cast off from thy hand.

[^4]

<sup>7</sup> They haue put me in b the lower lake: in the darke places, and in the shadow of death.

[^5]

<sup>8</sup> Thy furie is confirmed vpon me: and al thy waues thou hast brought in vpon me.

[^6]

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast made my familiars far from me: they haue put me abomination to themselues.

<sup>10</sup> I was deliuered and came not forth: † myne eies languished for pouertie.

I cried to thee ô Lord al the day: I stretched out my handes to thee.

<sup>11</sup> Wilt thou k doe meruels to the dead: or shal phisicians raise to life, and they confesse to thee?

[^7]

<sup>12</sup> Shal any l in the sepulchre declare thy mercie, and thy truth in perdition?

[^8]

<sup>13</sup> Shal thy meruelous workes be knowne m in darkenes: and thy iustice in the land of obliuion.

[^9]

<sup>14</sup> And I ô Lord haue cried to thee: and in the morning shal my praier preuent thee.

Why

[^1]: d I haue cried to thee very often both by day, and by night.

[^2]: e I am almost dead.

[^3]: f. Accounted as dead, and readie to be buried.

[^4]: g If I were dead, I should be free from these afflictions. Especially it agreeth to Christ, who was free, yea of infinite powre amongst the dead.

[^5]: h Myn enimies haue endeuored not only to bereue me of temporal life, wherby I should goe into limbus, but also to kil my soule spiritually, wherby I should descend into the lower hel of the damned.

[^6]: i Thy iust wrath also ô God hath excedingly afflicted me.

[^7]: k O God deliuer me whiles I am yet liuing, for I may not looke for extraordinarie, and miraculous helpe, as to be raised againe after death.

[^8]: l when I shal be dead & buried, I can not denounce thy praises as now I can to mortal men.

[^9]: m Much lesse shal the damned praise thee in eternal perdition.
