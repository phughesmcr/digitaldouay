b A harte waxing old, and burdened with much heate, and great hornes, draweth a serpent into his nosethrils, to being refreshed with poison, defendeth most ardently to drinke, and afterwards casteth his hornes, and heate, and becometh as it were yong againe. c with such feruent desire a true penitent, feeling himself burdened with poison of sinnes, desireth the water of Gods grace.

<sup>3</sup> My soule hath thirsted after God *the strong e liuing*: when shal I come and appeare before the face of God?

[^1] God is omnipotent, and in deede the only true liuing God: theis who are honored in idols, can do no more then God permitteth, and so they can kil the soules, that consent vnto their tentations, but can not refuse spiritual life againe. f The soule being iustified, and stil assaulted with new tentations desireth to be with God.

<sup>4</sup> My g teares haue beene breades vnto me day and night: whiles it is said to me daily: *h* Where is thy God?

[^2] I haue had no other refection, but to fensie my sorow with weping. h The wicked vprobate the iust, as though God would neuer helpe them, because he suffereth them to be sometimes long in tribulation.

<sup>5</sup> These things haue I remembered, and haue powred out my soule in me, because I shal passe into the place *i* of a meruelous tabernacle, euen to the house of God.

[^3] King Dauid was permitted to build the temple, much lesse did he enter into anie such meruelous tabernacle in his mortal life, but must nedes be vnderstood, to speake here of the heauenlie tabernacle, prepared by Christ for his seruants.

In the voyce of exultation, and confession: the sound of one feasting.

<sup>6</sup> Why *k* art thou sorowful my soule: and why dost thou trouble me?

<aside>*k The prophet comforteth him selfe, or anie iust soule, in the hope of euerlasting ioy.*</aside>

Hope in God, because yet I wil confesse to him: the saluation of my countenance, <sup>7</sup> and my God.

<aside>*I render thankes and praises.*</aside>

My soule is trubled toward my selfe; therefore wil I be mindful of thee from the land *m* of Iordan, and Hermoniim from the litle mountaine.

[^4] Al this life is like to the smal strait place betwene Iordan and a litle hil called Hermoniim, but from this straitnes the hope of the iust is to be placed in heauen.

<sup>8</sup> Depth *n* calleth on depth, in the voice of thy sloud-gates. Al thy hieghtes, and thy waues haue passed ouer me.

[^5] One tentation stil succeedeth an other: o and the same so great, as if God opened the gates, and suffered them to ouerflow like fluddes of water.

<sup>9</sup> In *p* the day our Lord hath commanded his mercie: and in the night a song of him.

[^6] But God helpeth in opportunitie, not suffering his seruantes to be tempted aboue their strength, geuing them fruit with tentations: q yea in the greatest tribulation, he geueth ordinarily most comfort, making them sing spiritually in hart, if not also in voice.
