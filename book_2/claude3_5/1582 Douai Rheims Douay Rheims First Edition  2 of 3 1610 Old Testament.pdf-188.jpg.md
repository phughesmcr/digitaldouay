# ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. CII.

[^1] Thy youth shall be renewed, as the Eagles.] Aristotel and Plinie write, that an Eagle decayeth not, nor euer dieth of old age, but the vpper part of her beake stil growing, and stil hindereth her from eating, and so she dieth of famine. Saadias, and other Hebrew Rabbins, reporte that an Eagle euerie tenne yeares, witteth herselfe in the sea in a storme (some saying, very high burneth her feathers in the elemental fire, & new feathers growing) she becometh fresh, as in her first youth, til at last about an hundred yeares old, she is not able to rise from the water and so is drowned. S. Augustin more probably affirmeth that in long time her beake growing long, and stopping her mouth, that she can not eate, she breaketh the vpper hooked part therof against a stone, and so receiueth meate, and recouereth strength, as in her youth. But whatsoever is the natural propertie of this kingly birde, the Royal Prophet here instructeth vs, by the similitude of her long life, or by the renouation of her strength, that iust men,

[^2] Renouation of sinners by grace.

[^3] Diuersitie of sense of the same Scripture.

[^4] Origen heretical that al shal be saued.

Gods seruantes are spiritually renuated in Christ, the principal rocke, on whom the Church, & al the faithful are built, either by receiuing new strength by his grace in their soules, after they are weakened by sinnes: as S. Ierom and Euthymius expound this place: or by restauration of their bodies glorified in the resurrection: as S. Augustin teacheth, and both, as most Catholique Doctors vnderstand it. For one sense of holie Scripture excludeth not an other. Especially when one is subordinate to the other. As here these two senses do very wel concurre, seing the state of the bodie after the resurrection, dependeth vpon the state of the soule, at the time of death.

[^5] We wil not be angrie alwayes.] Origen misunderstood this place, and some other like, holding an erronious opinion, that al, euen the most wicked sinners, both men and diuels, shal at last be saued, and not eternally damned: which is a condemned heresie, contrarie to euident places of holie Scriptures Psal 9 v. 6. The impious hath perished: their name thou hast destroyed for euer, & for euer & euer. Mat. 25. The wicked shal goe into fire euerlasting, into euerlasting punishment. Apoc. 20. The beast and the false prophet (and the same reason is for al the wicked) shal be tormented day and night, for euer and euer. Neither are these wordes (God wil not be angrie alwayes) spoken vniuersally, touching al sinners whosoeuer, but are limited, v. 13, & 17, to those that feare him, and kepe his testament: whereas those that dye in mortal sinne, are stil obstinate in malice, and can neuer rightly repent, nor rightly feare God, nor kepe his commandments.

[^6] The damned can neuer repent.
