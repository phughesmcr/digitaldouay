OF PSALMES: 41.

<sup>27</sup>And with the elect thou shalt be elect: and with the perverse thou shalt be perverted.

<sup>28</sup>Because thou wilt save the humble people: and the eies of the proud thou wilt humble.

<sup>29</sup>Because thou dost illuminate my lampe Ã´ Lord: my God illuminate my darkenesse.

<sup>30</sup>Because in thee I shal be delivered from tentation, and in my God I shal goe over the wal.[^1]

<sup>31</sup>My God his way is vnpolluted: the wordes of our Lord are examined by fire: he is protector of al that hope in him.[^2]

<sup>32</sup>For who is God but our Lord: or who is God but our God?

<sup>33</sup>God that girded me with strength: and made my way immaculate.

<sup>34</sup>That perfited my feete as it were of hartes: and setting me vpon high thinges.

<sup>35</sup>That teacheth my handes to battel: and hast put mine armes, as a bow of brasse.[^3]

<sup>36</sup>And hast geuen me the protection of thy saluation: and thy right hand hath receiued me:

And thy discipline hath corrected me vnto the end: and thy discipline the same shal teach me.

<sup>37</sup>Thou hast enlarged my pases vnder me: and my steppes are not weakened:

<sup>38</sup>I wil pursew myne enemies, and ouertake them: and wil not returne til they faile.

<sup>39</sup>I wil breake them, neither shal they be able to stand: they shal fal vnder my feete.

<sup>40</sup>And thou hast girded me with strength to battel: and hast supplanted them that rise against me vnder me.

<sup>41</sup>And myne enemies thou hast geuen me their backe, and them that hate me thou hast destroyed.[^4]

<sup>42</sup>They cried, neither was there that would saue them, to our Lord: neither did he heare them.

<sup>43</sup>And I wil breake them to powder,as the dust before the face of winde: as the durt of the streates I wil destroy them.

<sup>44</sup>Thou wilt deliuer me from the contradictions of the people: thou wilt appoynte me to be head of the Gentiles.

<sup>45</sup>A people, which I knew not, hath serued me: in the hearing of the eare it hath obeyed me.[^5]
