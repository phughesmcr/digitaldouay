OF PSALMES 241

<aside>Often haue they impugned me b from my youth, let Israel now say: Israel which is the Church of God, reioycing saith: that enimies haue often, b euen from the beginning of the world, persecuted me, as when Cain persecuted Abel, other wicked persecuted Seth, Enoch, Noe: the Chaldees persecuted Abraham, the Ægyptians persecuted the Israelites: and so in other generations.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> Often haue they impugned me from my youth: c but they haue not preuailed against me.

<aside>But they haue neuer ouercome me. So the Psalmist ealsieth for al times past, & prophesieth the same for times to come.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Sinners d haue builded vpon my backe: they haue e prolonged their iniquitie.

<aside>Persecuters not being able to ouerthrow, or suppresse the Church, haue laide great weightie burdens of tribulations vpon her backe, which she hath patiently and strongly borne, e they haue still resisted, one forte after an other, but with longanimitie the Church hath stood fast, and constantly passed through al distresses in moral sense sinners build iniquitie vpon the back of the Church, yea and vpon Gods back, when they presume to sinne, trusting in the end to be absolued by vertue of holie Sacraments left in the Church. Likewise when they excuse their sinnes, imputing the cause to other creatures of God, whereby they are allured: which is in effect (saith S. Augustine) to accuse God, and to build iniquities on Gods back, who made those creatures.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Our iust Lord wil cut the neckes of sinners: † let them f al be confounded and g turned backward, that hate Sion.

<aside>God therfore who is iust, wil at last cut such presumptuous sinners from his back, and breake their stiffe neckes: g then shal they be confounded, h separated eternally from God, become like fruitles, and withered grasse, cast away, despised, yea cursed of al, and blessed by none, as the Prophet denounceth in the next verses.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Let them be made as grasse in the toppes of houses: which is withered before it be plucked vp.

<sup>7</sup> Wherof the reaper hath not filled his hand, and he that gathereth the sheaues his bosome.

<sup>8</sup> And they sayd not that passed by: The blessing of our Lord be vpon you: we haue blessed you in the name of our Lord.

PSALME CXXIX.

*The Iewes, or other people in tribulation for sinne, or temporal captiuitie, The sixth penitential Psalme. crie to God to be deliuered: 4. trusting, and encoraging ech other in Gods accustomed mercie, assuredly hoping that he wil redeme & deliuer them.* the 7. key.

1 A gradual Canticle.

<sup>2</sup> FROM a the depthes I haue cried to thee ô Lord: † Lord heare my voice:

<aside>This prayer agreeth to al true penitents, crying to God for helpe, being either in depth of sorow for sinne, and so it is one of the Penitential Psalmes, or the depth of seruent desire to ascend towards perfection in vertue, and from this vaile of miserie into heauen, an I so it is a Gradual Psalme: or in the depth of temporal paines, and so it is a special prayer for soules in Purgatorie, offered by the Church in their behalfe.</aside>
