<sup>7</sup>The unwise man wil not know; and the foule wil not understand these thinges.

<sup>8</sup>When sinners shal spring vp as grasse: and al that worke iniquitie shal appeare.

That they may perish for euer: <sup>9</sup>but thou the Highest foreuer ô Lord.

<sup>10</sup>Because loe thine enimies ô Lord, because loe thine enimies shal perish: and al that worke iniquitie shal be dispersed.

<sup>11</sup>And my horne shal be exalted, as the vnicorns: and my old age in plentiful mercie.

<sup>12</sup>And mine eie hath looked vpon mine enimies: and the malignant rysing vp against me, mine ears shal heare.

<sup>14</sup>They that are planted in the house of our Lord, shal florish in the courtes of the house of our God.

That the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquitie in him.
