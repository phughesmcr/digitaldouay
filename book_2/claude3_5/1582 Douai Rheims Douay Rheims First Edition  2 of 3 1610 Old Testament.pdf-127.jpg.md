OF PSALMES. 127

<sup>16</sup> Let not the tempest of water drowne me, nor the depth swallowe me: r neither let the pit shut his mouth vpon me.

<aside>r Though Christ died and was buried, and in soule descended into hel, yet he could not be holden in his sepulchre, nor in limbo, but rose againe.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> Heare me ô Lord because thy mercie is benigne: according to the multitude of thy commiserations haue respect to me.

<sup>18</sup> And turne not away thy face from thy seruant: because I am in tribulation, heare me speedily.

<sup>19</sup> Attend to my soule and, deliuer it: / because of mine enimies deliuer me.

<aside>/ That they may either be conuerted, or confounded, and so do no more hurt.</aside>

<sup>20</sup> Thou knowest my reproch, & my confusion, & my shame.

<sup>21</sup> In thy sight are al they that afflict me, my hart hath looked for reproch and miserie.

And I expected some bodie that would be sorie together with me, and there s was none: and that would comfort me, and I founde not.

<aside>Mat. 27. an. 19.</aside>

<sup>22</sup> And they gaue v gal for my meate: & in my thirst they gaue me vinegre to drinke.

<sup>23</sup> w Let their table be made a snare before them, & for retributions, and for a scandal.

<aside>w A prophecie of the destruction of the Iewes, at the time of Pasch, when they should thinke to eate their paschal lamb with ioy.</aside>

<sup>24</sup> Let x Their eies be darkned that they see not: and make their backe crooked alwaies.

<aside>x They are also blinde in hart, that they wil not see the truth of Christs doctrine: y but bow themselues to earthlie thinges, and worldlie gaines euen to this day.</aside>

<sup>25</sup> Poure out thy wrath vpon them: and let the furie of thy wrath ouertake them.

<sup>26</sup> Let their habitation be made desert: and in their tabernacles let there be none to dwel.

<aside>Act. 1.</aside>

<sup>27</sup> Because z whom thou hast striken, they haue persecuted: and vpon the sorrow of my wounds they haue added.

<aside>z Christ, whom God of his mercie designed to suffer death, for redemption of mankind, the Iewes of mere enuie and malice persecuted to death.</aside>

<sup>28</sup> Adde thou w iniquitie vpon their iniquitie: and let them not enter into thy iustice.

<aside>w A prophecie that God would suffer them to fal from one iniquitie to an other.</aside>
