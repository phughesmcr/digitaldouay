And for <sup>14</sup>cursing and lying they shal be talked of in consummation: in wrath of consummation and they shal not be.[^1] And they shal know that God wil rule Iacob: and ouer the endes of the earth.

<sup>15</sup>They shal be turned at euening, and shal suffer famine as dogges: and shal compasse the citie.[^2]

<sup>16</sup>They shal be dispersed to eate: and if they be not filled, they wil murmur also.

[^3]

<sup>17</sup>But I wil sing thy strength: and wil exalt thy mercie in the morning.

Because thou art become my receiuer, and my refuge, in the day of my tribulation.

My helper, I wil sing to thee, because thou art God my receiuer: my God, my mercie.

PSALME. LIX.

*King Dauid after his owne and the peoples manie tribulations, 1. rendereth thankes for their renowned victories, 11. atchieued by Gods only powre.*

<sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, for them, a that shal be changed, in the inscription of the title b to Dauid him selfe, c for doctrine, <sup>2</sup>d when he set fire on Mesopotamia of Syria, and in Sobal, and Ioab returned, and stroke Idum√¶a in the valley of saltpittes twelue thousand. (2. *Reg. 8. & 10. & 1. Paral. 18.*)

[^4]

O God thou hast repelled vs, & hast destroyed vs: thou <sup>3</sup>wast angrie e and hast had mercie on vs.

[^5]

<sup>4</sup>Thou hast moued the earth, and hast trubled it: heale the breaches thereof, because it is moued.

<sup>5</sup>Thou hast shewed vnto thy people h hard thinges: thou hast made vs drinke the wine of compunction.[^6]

<sup>6</sup>Thou hast geuen a signification to them that feare thee: that they flee from the face of the bow.

<sup>7</sup>That thy beloued k may be deliuered, saue me with thy right hand; and heare me.

[^1]: n After that their iniquitie is complete e they shal be secured and punished for their blasphemies and lies. And they shal know that God wil rule Iacob: and ouer

[^2]: p As. v. 7.

[^3]: q They shal in vaine seeke oyle for their lampes with the foolish virgins, repent with Iudas, and finding no helpe, shal continually blaspheme in hel.
r In the resurrection.

[^4]: a The change of state from aduersitie to prosperitie in the people of Israel, was a figure of the like change in the Church of Christ. b worthie to be remembred, c for the instruction, d of Gods beloued, e as the same are more largely recorded in the bookes of kinges.

[^5]: f God suffereth his people to be afflicted, as wel for their sinnes, as for exercise in vertue, g after sheweth his mercie in pardoning, and fauour in aduancing them.

[^6]: h by punishing sinners.
i VVarning them to amend they flee from the face of the bow.
k and then restoreth them to former good state.
