<sup>13</sup> Turne not away thy face from me: in what day soever I am in tribulation, incline thine eare to me.

[^1] Though sinne provoke Gods wrath, because we by sinning turne from him, and not he first from vs: yet we pray God not so to leave vs, but to give vs a new grace, that by humilitie, and penance we may returne to him, and not dye in sinne.

In what day soever I shal invocate thee, heare me speedely.

<sup>4</sup> Because my dayes have vanished as smoke: and my bones are withered as a drie burnt firebrand.

[^2] Mans dayes, and al his workes are nothing worth, but vanish like smoke, so long as he is in mortal sinne: *e yeahis best workes as almes deedes, fasting, and dayly almes, fast, prayers, yea al those availe nothing (1 Cor. 13) but are like dryed stockes, or chippes, fitte to kindle the fire.

<sup>5</sup> I am striken as grasse, and my hart is withered: because I have forgotten to eate my bread.

[^3] My soule separated by sinne from God, withereth as grasse, that is cutte from the roote: because I have lost al savour and appetite to spiritual meate.

<sup>6</sup> For the voyce of my groning, my bone hath cleaued to my flesh.

[^4] In this miserable state, I am as bones and flesh cleaving together without moysture, or radical humour.

<sup>7</sup> I am become like a pellicane of the wildernes: I am become as a nightcrow in the house.

[^5] I flie from conversation of men for sorow, and shame of my sinnes: *m* as a crow that only flieth by night: or as an owle, or batte.

<sup>8</sup> I have watched, and am become as a sparow solitarie in the house toppe.

[^6] Also as a sparow having lost her mate, remaineth mourning and solitarie in the accustomed nest, or nere vnto it.

<sup>9</sup> Al the day did mine enemies vpbrayde me: and they that praysed me, sware against me.

<aside>*Those that were wont to praise or flatter me, now are as sworne enemies against me.*</aside>

<sup>10</sup> Because I did eate ashes as bread, & mingled my drinke with weeping.

[^7] Bread savoured to me no better then ashes. *q* and drinke gave me no comfort, but stil I wept.

<sup>11</sup> At the face of thy wrath and indignation: because lifting me vp thou hast throwen me downe.

[^8] I am most especially afflicted, because thou art angrie. *t* In that thou didst sometime advance me in prosperitie, *t* my fall is so much greater, and more grievous.

<sup>12</sup> My dayes have declined as a shadow: and I am withered as grasse.

[^9] As a shadow declineth to nothing, and albecometh darknes, when the sunne, and other light departeth, even so I, that am but a shadow, decline to mere darknes, when thy favoure parteth from me. *yy* and I lose my beautie, as grasse cutte from the ground withereth.
