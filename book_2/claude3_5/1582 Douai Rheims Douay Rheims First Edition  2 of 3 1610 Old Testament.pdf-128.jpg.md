<sup>29</sup>Let them be put out of the booke of the liuing: and with the iust let them not be written.

[^1]In the end of their liues, they shal not be found in the booke of life, where they suppose themselues to be written.

<sup>30</sup>I am poore and sorowful: d thy saluation Ã´ God hath receiued me.

[^2]The voice of Christ, humbling himselfe to death, euen to death of the Crosse: d from which he rose againe.

<sup>31</sup>I wil praise the name of God with canticle: and wil magnifie him in prayse.

<sup>32</sup>And e it shal please God more then a young calfe: that bringeth forth hornes and hoofes.

[^3]Deuout praise and thankesgeuing please God more then fattest sacrifices of the most tender calues, which were otherwise also grateful sacrifices.

<sup>33</sup>Let the poore see and reioyce: seeke ye God, and your soule shal liue.

<sup>34</sup>Because our Lord hath heard the poore: and he hath not despised s his prisoners.

<sup>35</sup>Let g the heauens and earth praise him, the sea, and al the creeping beastes in them.

<aside>g Al the creatures of God.</aside>

<sup>36</sup>h Because God wil saue Sion: and i the cities of Iuda shal be built vp.

[^5]God wil alwayes establish and protect the Catholique Church: i and particular Churches, members of the vniuersal shal also prosper.

And they shal inhabite there, & by inheritance they shal get it:

<sup>37</sup>And k the seede of his seruants shal possesse it, and they that loue his name shal dwel in it.

[^6]Perpetual succession of the Catholique Church.

[^8]Al men at al times nede Gods helpe: d but most present nede, in present dangers. The rest of this Psalme is conteyned in the 39.
