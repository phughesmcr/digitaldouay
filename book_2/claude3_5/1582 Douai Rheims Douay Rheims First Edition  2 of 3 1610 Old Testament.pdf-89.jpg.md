OF PSALMES.

<sup>5</sup> With thy beautie and fayrneffe intend, procede prosperously, and reigne,

<aside>purposing, o prosecuting, p and perfecting the conquest, and so establishing thy spiritual kingdome.</aside>

Because of truth, and mildeneffe, and justice: and thy righthand shal conduct thee meruelously.

<aside>Not with warlike armour of this world, but by assailing the aduersarie with truth: defending thyselfe and thy souldiers with the shield of mildnes, r and striking the enemie with the sword of justice. Which rightforce of spiritual fight hath meruelous good successe.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Thy sharpe arrowes, the peoples underneath thee shal fal into the hartes of the kings enemies.

<aside>Preaching of Christs Gospel, his grace mouing the hartes of the hearers: it liuelie and forcible, more pearcing then anie two edged sword. t The example of people conuerted, shal moue the hartes of the aduersaries to come also vnto the truth.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> "Thy seate Ã´ God *w* for euer and euer: a rod of direction the rod of thy kingdom.

<aside>Christs kingdom shal haue no end. Luc. 1. v. 33.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast loued iustice, and hast hated iniquitie: therfore God, thy God, hath annoynted thee with the oile of gladnes aboue thy felowes.

<aside>Thou defendest and rewardest the good, finally forsakest and punishest the wicked. y more peculiarly the God of Christ, by hypostatical vnion. z Diuers kinges (as Dauid him selfe, Iosaphat, Ezechias, and Iosias) were as godlie as Salomon, and perseuercd good to the end, which is doubted Salomon did not: but Christ incomparably was annointed, & indued with al graces aboue al kinges.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> Myrrhe, and Aloes, and Cassia from thy garmentes, from houses of yuorie, out of the which <sup>10</sup> the daughter of kinges haue delighted thee in thy honour.

<aside>Mortification which conserueth from corruption, & humilitie aswaging pride, c being smal in the first spring groweth great, d humanitie assumed; and sanctified persons, in vvhom Christ dwelleth as in cleane, shining, odoriferous houses: e sincere faithful soules more deare to their spouse Christ, then daughters of temporal kinges.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> The Queene stood on thy right hand in golden rayment: compassed with varietie.

<aside>The Catholique Church, in faith purified as gold: r with varietie of states, as Clergie, Laitie and diuers sortes of religious Orders, and other professions, al vnited in the same faith, hope, and charitie.</aside>

<sup>12</sup> Heare daughter, and see, and incline thyne eare: and forget thy people, and the house of thy father.

<aside>carefully al that Christ thy spouse speaketh to thee by his Spirite: i diligently put the same in practise: k with al obedience and readines, and returne not to former infidelitie, nor to corrupt life.</aside>

<sup>13</sup> And the king wil couet thy beautie: because he is the Lord thy God, and they shal adore him.

<aside>Christ loueth the Church adorned with his giftes, m and mutually his true children loue and serue him.</aside>
