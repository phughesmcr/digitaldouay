<sup>78</sup> Let the proud be confounded, because they have done unjustly toward me: but I will be exercised in thy commandments.

<aside>The just also prayeth that the wicked may be ashamed, and converted, for so the hebrew word here signifieth, though it is also lawful to desire the just punishment of obstinate sinners.</aside>

<sup>79</sup> Let them be converted to me that fear thee: and that know thy testimonies.

<aside>He prayeth againe for conversion of the wicked, and to have peace with them.</aside>

<sup>80</sup> Let my hart be made immaculate in thy justifications, that I be not confounded.

Caph. Hand, or Palme of the hand.

<sup>81</sup> My soule hath fainted for thy salvation: and I have much hoped in thy word.[^1]

<sup>82</sup> Myne eies have fayled for thy word, saying: When wilt thou comfort me?[^2]

<sup>83</sup> Because I am made as a bottel in the hoare frost: I have not forgotten thy justifications.[^3]

<sup>84</sup> How manie are the daies of thy servant: when wilt thou doe judgement on them that persecute me?[^4]

<sup>85</sup> The unjust have told me fables: but not as thy law.[^5]

<sup>86</sup> Al thy commandmentes are truth: they have unjustly persecuted me, helpe me.

<sup>87</sup> They have welnere made an end of me in the earth: but I have not forsaken thy commandments.[^6]

<sup>88</sup> According to thy mercie quicken me: and I shal keepe the testimonies of thy mouth.

Lamed. Discipline.

<sup>89</sup> For ever Lord thy word is permanent in heaven.[^7]

<sup>90</sup> Thy truth in generation and generation: thou hast founded the earth, and it is permanent.

[^1]: Manie just of the old testament most fervently desired the coming of Christ our Saviour, as our Lord himselfe testifieth, Mat. 13. v. 17. And now the just desire his coming in glorie, 2. Tim. 4. v. 8.

[^2]: Delayed hope afflicteth.

[^3]: As a leather bottel made of a beasts skinne, congeled with the frost, and after parched in smoke, (as is the bodie of the just mortified by diuers sortes of afflictions) made a new vessel fitte to receive new wine, that is, perfect doctrine of Christian life, as of fasting, and other austeritie, wherof our Saviour speaketh, Mat. 9. v. 17.

[^4]: Such is mans infirmitie, yea of the just, that he apprehendeth tribulations to be very long, and therfore desireth consummation; and that without fault, so he stil submitte his wil to Gods wil.

[^5]: Frivolous idle tales, which are not according to Gods law.

[^6]: I was in great danger, but am not overthrowne.

[^7]: And by thy merciful grace shal persist.
