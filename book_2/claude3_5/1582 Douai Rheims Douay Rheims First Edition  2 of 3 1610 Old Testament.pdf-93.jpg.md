OF PSALMES. 93

<sup>7</sup> Sing ye to our *h* God, sing ye: Sing ye to our *i* king, sing ye.

<aside>h The same Christ is our God, by his Divinitie: i and our king by his Humanitie.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> Because God is king of al the earth: sing ye *k* wisely.

<aside>k Doe your endeauour to vnderstand what you sing, read, or heare in Gods word. At least to know the principal Mysteries, and pointes of Christian doctrin, euerie one according to their capacitie and state of profession.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> God shal reigne ouer the gentiles: God sitteth vpon his holie seate.

<sup>10</sup> Princes of peoples are gathered together with *l* the God of Abraham: because the strong *m* goddes of the earth, are excedingly aduanced.

<aside>l The faithful of the old and new Testament are vnited in the seruice of one, and the same eternal God. m In respect of the Blessed Trinitie, holie Scripture here, and in manie places vseth names of the plural number as Elohim Goddes, not denying Gods substance, which is one, but insinuating distinction of Diuine Persons, The Father, the Sonne, and the Holie Ghost. Which Mysterie is more expresly mentioned in Baptisme, and professed by Christian gentils, then it was by the people of the Iewes.</aside>

PSALME XLVII.

*God most, and euerie where laudable, is specially praised in the Church of Christ (prefigured by Sion, and there begunne) 9. Al thinges being fulfilled in the Church, euen as they were prophecied, and promised, 12. the faithful are exhorted to consider and congratulate the same.*

[^1]

1 A Psalme *a* of Canticle to the sonnes of Core, *the b* second of the Sabbath.

<aside>a Voices beginning the musike instruments prosecuted; b especially for the second day of the weke, the day after the sabbath, which is our Sunday, called Dominica, our Lords day.</aside>

2 GREAT is our Lord, and to be praised excedingly in the citie of our God, in his holie mount.

<aside>c Ierusalem, and mount Sion were most obliged to praise God, for greatest benefites receiued, to the Catholique Church thereby prefigured, and hauing receiued farre greater, is most of al bounden to be grateful.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Mount Sion is founded with the exultation of *d* the whole earth, *e* the sides of the North, the citie of the great king.

<aside>d This can not be affirmed of Sion, or Ierusalem, but is only verified of the Catholique Christian Church: e whose coastes do extend to the North, and to al quarters of the round earth.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> God shal be knowen in *f* the houses thereof, *g* when he shal receiue it.

<aside>f The same one God, one Christ, one Faith, and one Religion in al particular Churches of the whole militant Church. g And this Vniuersalitie, and Vnitie shal be, after that Christ taking mans nature shal be ascended, and shal send the Holie Ghost, to found & beginne this Church.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> For behold the kings of the earth *h* were gathered together: they assembled in one.

<aside>h For the assured certaintie of that is foreshewed, the Prophet speaketh in the preterence, as if it were already done in his time, which he then saw in spirite.</aside>
