<sup>17</sup>But I have cried to God, and our Lord wil save me.
<sup>18</sup>In *the evening, and morning, & at midday, I wil* speake, and declare, and he wil heare my voice.

[^1] The prophet alludeth to these more specially appointed houres of Divine Service, the daylie sacrifice at morning, and evening, and other sacrifices commonly about midday. Which also are the three principal times of Divine Service in the Church of Christ. Mattins, Evensong, and the Sacrifice of Masse. Which Eutymius and other Grecians cal Lyturgiain. S. Clement also (l. 7. c. 15. Apost. Inst.) testifieth that the Apostles ordained three set houres of common prayer everie day.

<sup>19</sup>He wil redeme my soule in peace from them, that approch to me: because among manie *f* they were with me.

[^2] Manie enimies combined together approched vnto me, to overthrow me.

<sup>20</sup>God wil heare, and he *g* which is before the worldes wil humble them.

[^3] Eternal God.

<sup>21</sup>For there is *h* no change with them, & they feared not God: he hath streached forth his hand in repaying.

[^4] They wil never repent of their wickednes.

<sup>22</sup>They have contaminated his testament, they are *i* divided by the wrath of his countenance; and *k* his hart hath approched.

[^5] They harden their hartes against his threatned wrath: *k* but Gods providence illuminateth others to know and teach the truth, when it is impugned, or contemned.

*l* His wordes are made softer then oile: and *m* the same are dartes.

[^6] Gods wordes, which in them selves are meeke and swete, *m* are hard to the incredulous, & as dartes that wound them. Christ said (Ioan. 6.) Vnles one eate my flesh, & drinke my bloud, he shal not have life in him, which the Capharnaites not vnderstanding said one to an other: This is a hard speach, who can abide it? which S. Augustin here saith was the first heresie against our Saviour's preaching. It was not hard to S. Peter, who in the name of the rest, answered, that Christ had the wordes of eternal life. He yet vnderstood not the secrete of our Lords speach, but he piously beleved that the wordes were good, which he vnderstood not.

<sup>23</sup>*n* Cast thy care vpon our Lord: and he wil nourish thee: he wil not geue *o* fluctuation to the iust for euer.

<aside>Therefore in al doubtes of doctrin, in al difficulties of persecution, and other difficulties which surpasse this weakenes, cast thy care vpon our Lord, and he wil nourish thee.</aside>

<aside>He wil not suffer the iust to remaine alwayes in fluctuation, that is, in doubtful, dangerous, and vvexatious thoughtes or perplexities, as when a shippe is tossed in the waues of the sea, but wil geue quiet repose of mind, as in a sure hauen without danger of drowning.</aside>

<sup>24</sup>But thou ô God wilt bring *p* them downe into the pitte of destruction.

[^7] Contrariwise, the wicked and obstinate shal fal into destruction.

*q* Bloudy and deceitful men shal not liue halfe their daies. but I wil hope in thee ô Lord.

[^8] Often or for most part, bloud-suckers dye before the course of nature requireth, as Saul, Absolon, Achitophel, Achab, Iezabel, and the like.
