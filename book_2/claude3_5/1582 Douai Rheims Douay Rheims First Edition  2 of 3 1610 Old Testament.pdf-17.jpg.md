<sup>9</sup> Thou shalt rule them in a rod of yron, and as potters vessel thou shalt breake them in peeces.[^1]

<sup>11</sup> Serue our Lord in r feare: and reioyce to him with trembling.[^3]

<sup>12</sup> Apprehend discipline, lest sometime our Lord be wrath, and you perish out of the iust way.[^4]

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. II.

2. *Kinges and Princes against Christ.*] When Christ, and his Apostles preached the Gospel, both Iewes and Gentiles, with their Princes, Kinges, and Emperours most furiously resisted, but al in vaine. For they could not hinder the glorie of God. But the more they persecuted, the more was increased the faith, and number of Christians.

8. *The gentiles thyn inheritance.*] By this promise of God to Christ, S. Augustin conuinced the Donatistes: & in them the Protestantes, that the Church of Christ failed, and became final, or inuisible: as though Christ the Sonne of God, could sometimes lose his inheritance, which is the Catholique Church, gathered of the Gentiles, and not confined to the endes of the earth.

9. *As a potters vessel.*] If a potters vessel (saith S. Ierom *in hunc psal. to.* 8.) be broken whilst it is soft, it may be repared, but after it is hard, if it be broken, it can not be made whole againe. So sinners are more easily reformed in grace, shortly repenting, then long obdurate: yet that which is vnpossible to man, is possible to God. *Mat. 19. For as easy is the potters hand, to repare as to make.* *Saith our Lord, Iere. 18.*

10. *Ye kinges vnderstand.*] Not only priuate persons of al nations, Kinges conbut also after a while, Kinges and Emperours beleued in Christ. And such as at uerted to first persecuted, became most Christian, Catholique, Defenders of the faith. Christianitie.

12. *Take discipline you that iudge.*] Tertullian, Gaudentius, & other Donatistes inueyhing against Christian Kinges, for punishing heretikes, most falsly auouch, that Christianitie neuer knew kinges but naturall enemies, and persecuters. To whom S. Augustin answereth in seueral bookes, that Christian Kinges, and Princes are not enemies to Christianitie: but are enemies to heretikes, the enemies of Christ, and his Church. For according to this prophecie of king Dauid, Christian kinges are instructed, and know it is their dutie, as the seruice of God, to defend the Church against Heretikes, and other Infidelles. And it is the propertie of Apostates to fauour heretikes. So good Constantin maintained Catholique veritie; and Iulian the Apostate to make great heresies, excited they her diuision, tooke Christians from Catholicisme, and gaue them to Donatistes, here al Chri- to nourish stians.
