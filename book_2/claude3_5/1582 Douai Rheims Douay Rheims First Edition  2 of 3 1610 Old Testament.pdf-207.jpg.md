PSALME CXIII

*For the meruelous passage of Israel out of Ægypt, 3. the red sea, the riuer of Iordan, 7. and the hilles giuing them place, 8. the rockes yelding them water, 9. God, not themselues, is to be praised. 12. Idoles and Idolaters are vaine, and shal be confounded: 17. the faithful trust in God, 20. are blessed, and for euer praise God.* [^2]

[^2]: The meruelous passage of Israel from Ægypt.

Alleluia.

<sup>1</sup> IN the comming forth of Israel out of Ægypt, of the house of Iacob from a barbarous people.

<aside>a People of false religion counted barbarous, efpecially such as also persecute the true Religion; for otherwise the Ægyptians were both ciuil in maners, and learned in manie sciences.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> Iurie was made his sanctification, Israel his dominion.

<aside>b The people of Iurie were more notoriously renowned in the world from the time of their deliuerie out of Ægypt, for the peculiar people, whom God sanctified, and in whom, as in his elected inheritance or dominion, he dwelled and reigned.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> The c sea saw, and fled: Iordan d was turned backeward. [^3]

<sup>4</sup> The mountaines leaped as rammes: and the litle hilles as the lambes of sheepe.

<aside>f Either there was an earthquake, or some other mouing of hilles not mentioned by Moyses, or els the Psalmist speaketh of the rockes of the mountaines which bowed, that the Israelites might rest in Ar, and lie in the borders of the Moabites, Num, 21, v 15,</aside>

<sup>5</sup> What aileth thee ô sea that thou didst flee: and thou ô Iordan, that thou wast turned backward?

<aside>g By the figure prosopopoeia he speaketh to the sea, riuer, and hilles: vsing also Prosopopoeia: as if sensles thinges, vnderstood, and should answer.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Ye mountaines leaped as rammes, and ye litle hilles as the lambes of shepe.

<sup>7</sup> At the face of our Lord was the earth moued, at the face of the God of Iacob.

<sup>8</sup> Who turned h the rocke into pooles of waters, and stonie hil into fountaines of waters.

<aside>h As other miraculous benefites, that the rocke yelded them water in their necessitie.</aside>

<sup>9</sup> Not
