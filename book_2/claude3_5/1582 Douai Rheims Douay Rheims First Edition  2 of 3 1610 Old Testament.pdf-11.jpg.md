To al this we may adde other causes, which moved the Royal Prophete to write this divine poetrie. First he had from his youth (by Gods special providence) a natural inclination to Musike; wherin he shortly so excelled, that before al the Musicians in Israel, he was called to recreate king Saul, whom an evil spirite vexed.
