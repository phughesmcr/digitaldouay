OF PSALMES. 261

Alleluia, *a* of Aggæus, and Zacharie.

<aside>a The Septuagint added the names of these two Prophetes, for the like reasons as they added Ieremie, Psal. 136. because Aggæus and Zacharias prophecying in the reduction of the people from captivitie, exhorted them, as here the Psalmist doth, to trust in Gods providence, and preferre his service before worldlie cares.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> MY soule prayse thou our Lord, I wil praise our Lord in my life: I wil sing to my God as long as I shal be.

<sup>3</sup> Put not confidence in princes: <sup>†</sup> in *b* the sonnes of men, in whom there is no saluation.[^1]

<sup>4</sup> <sup>†</sup> His spirit shal goe forth, and he shal returne into his earth: *c* He saith not, that the spirit or soule shal turne into the earth, but the soule shal depart from the bodie, and for euerie one (in whom worldlie men put their trust) shal according to the bodie, returne into his earth.[^2]

<sup>5</sup> Blessed is he, whose helper is the God of Iacob, his hope in our Lord his God: <sup>6</sup> <sup>†</sup> who made heauen and earth, the sea, and al thinges that are in them.

<sup>7</sup> Which keepeth truth for euer, doth iudgement for them that suffer wrong: geueth foode to the hungrie.

<sup>8</sup> Our Lord looseth the fettered: <sup>†</sup> our Lord illuminateth the blind.

Our Lord lifteth vp the bruised, our Lord loueth the iust.

<sup>9</sup> Our Lord keepeth strangers, the pupil, and widow he wil receiue: and the wayes of sinners he wil destroy.

<sup>10</sup> Our Lord wil reigne for euer thy God ô Sion, in generation and generation.

1 Alleluia.

PRAYSE ye our Lord because Psalme *a* is good: to our God let there be pleasant, and comelie praise.[^3]

<sup>2</sup> Our Lord building vp Ierusalem: *b* wil gather together the dispersions of Israel.[^4]

<sup>3</sup> Who healeth the contrite of hart: and bindeth vp their sores.[^5]

<sup>4</sup> Who *d* numbereth the multitude of starres: and *e* geueth names to them al.[^6]

[^1]: b In one Sonne of Man (Christ) is saluation (saith S. Augustin) and in him, not because he is the sonne of man, but because he is the Sonne of God.

[^2]: c in that day al their cogitations shal perish.

[^3]: a It is good to sing Psalmes of praise to God.

[^4]: b A prophecie of the reduction of Iewes from the captivitie.

[^5]: c Remitteth sinnes to the penitent.

[^6]: d Besides experience of euerie one, that shal behold the firmament in a clere night, the holie Scripture (Gen. 15. v. 5.) sheweth, that the starres are innumerable to man. For albeit Ptolomey
