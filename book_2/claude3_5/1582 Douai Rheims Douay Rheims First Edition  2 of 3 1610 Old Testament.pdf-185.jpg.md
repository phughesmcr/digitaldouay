OF PSALMES 185

<sup>13</sup> But thou ô Lord endurest for euer : and thy memorial in generation and generation.

<aside>But I am meruelously comforted, considering that thou our Messias, the Sonne of God, art immutable for euer : and thy memorable promise of redeeming mankind, wil haue effect in al generations.</aside>

<sup>14</sup> Thou rising vp shal haue mercie on Sion : because it is time to haue mercie on it, because the time cometh.

[^1]

<sup>15</sup> Because the stones thereof haue pleased thy seruantes : and they shal haue pitie on the earth thereof.

[^2]

<sup>16</sup> And the Gentiles shal feare thy name ô Lord, and al the kinges of the earth thy glorie.

[^3]

<sup>17</sup> Because our Lord hath built Sion : and he shal be seene in his glorie.

<sup>18</sup> He hath had respect to the prayer of the humble : and he hath not despised their petition.

<aside>Of holie Patriarches, Priestes, Prophetes, and of al true penitents.</aside>

<sup>19</sup> Let these thinges be written vnto an other generation : and the people, that shal be created, shal praise our Lord.

[^4]

<sup>20</sup> Because he hath looked forth from his high holie place: our Lord from heauen hath looked vpon the earth.

<sup>21</sup> That he might heare the gronings of the fettered : that he might loose the children of them that are slayne :

<sup>22</sup> That they may shew forth the name of our Lord in Sion : and his praise in Ierusalem.

[^5]

<sup>23</sup> In the assembling of the people together in one, and kinges to serue our Lord.

<sup>24</sup> He answered him in the way of his strength : Shew me the fewnes of my daies.

<sup>25</sup> Cal me not backe in the halfe of my daies : thy yeares are vnto generation and generation.

[^6]

<sup>26</sup> In the beginning ô Lord thou didst found the earth : and the heauens are the workes of thy hands.

[^1]: Thou rising to helpe, who semeth to haue forgote, wilt protect the Church, and euerie faithful soule: because thou hast deferred long: and because the time by thee designed semeth to approch

[^2]: Men that shal heare thyn Apostles preach, shal proue good and fitte matter, for the building of thy Church: and the simplest poore people, as it were, the earth or dust, shal participate of this mercie.

[^3]: Besides those few that shal belieue in Christ, much more the Gentiles shal feare and serue him. His glorie is so euident that al kinges know it, though al be not conuerted.

[^4]: That shal be made a new creature in Christ.

[^5]: The faithful people of the Church, according to their habilitie endeuour to serue Christ.

[^6]: Grant mature and constant to be mature in vertue in this life.
