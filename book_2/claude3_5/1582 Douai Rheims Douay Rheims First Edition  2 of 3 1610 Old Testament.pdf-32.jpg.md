<sup>2</sup> How long shal I put b counsels in my soule, sorrow in my hart c by day?

<sup>3</sup> How long shal mine enemies be exalted ouer me?

<sup>4</sup> Regard and heare me ô Lord my God.

Illuminate mine eies that I sleepe not d in death at any time:

<sup>5</sup> lest sometime mine enemie say: I haue preuailed against him. They that truble me, wil reioyce if I be moued: <sup>6</sup> but I haue hoped in thy mercie.

My hart shal reioyce in thy saluation: I wil sing to our Lord which geueth me e good thinges: and I wil sing to the name of our Lord most high.
