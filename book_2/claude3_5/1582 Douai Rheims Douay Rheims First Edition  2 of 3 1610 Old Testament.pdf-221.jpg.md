OF PSALMES 221

<sup>38</sup> Establish thy word to thy servant, in thy feare.

<aside>Againe he still prayeth for confirmation in grace, to be established in the feare of God.</aside>

<sup>39</sup> Take away my reproch, which I haue feared: because thy iudgements are pleasant.

<aside>To be deliuered also from al the effectes of former sinnes, as sinne is therfore reproachful and odious, because it is contrarie to Gods law, and true iudgements, which are most pleasant.</aside>

<sup>40</sup> Behold I haue coueted thy commandments: in thine equitie quicken me.

<aside>Being thus affected with desire to kepe the commandments, the soule prayeth to be stil quickened, more and more with good spirite, and so to perseuer to the end.</aside>

Vau. And.

<sup>41</sup> And let thy mercie come vpon me Ã´ Lord: & thy saluation according to thy word.

<aside>Againe considering that without Gods grace preuenting, man can not do anie good thing, he prayeth euer with his prayer, requesting Gods mercie, & and his helpe freely promised to al that aske it.</aside>

<sup>42</sup> And I shal answer a word to them that vpbrayde me: because I haue hoped in thy wordes.

<aside>Wherewith being assisted and strengthened, he therfore reweaketh boldly answer al calumniators, that reproachfully say: God wil not help him: & that in dede he hath not in vaine trusted in Gods promised helpe.</aside>

<sup>43</sup> And take not away out of my mouth the word of truth vtterly: because I haue much hoped in thy iudgements.

<aside>He also prayeth, though he be sometimes fearful, that God wil not suffer him whollly to omitte manifest profession of faith and true religion, seeing by thy former grace I haue already reposed my trust in thy promises, made to them that are resolued to kepe thy lawe.</aside>

<sup>44</sup> And I wil keepe thy law alwayes: for euer, and for euer and euer.

<aside>For I do firmly purpose euer and alwayes to kepe thy law.</aside>

<sup>45</sup> And I walked in largenesse: because I haue sought after thy commandments.

<aside>In this I haue had great ioy and comfort of mind: because I did in dede seeke after thy commandments, which is specially vttered (as also the three next verses) in the person of those, that are in trial of persecutions for their faith:</aside>

<sup>46</sup> And I spake of thy testimonies in the sight of kinges: and was not confounded.

<aside>Who boldly in time of persecution before persecuting Kinges and Emperors, professe Christs true Religion. Verified in innumerable glorious Martyrs, yea also of the fraile sexe, in S. Catharin, S. Cecilie, S. Lucie, S. Margaret, S. Wenefrede, S. Vrsula, and her fellowes, and manie more, most constantly suffering al torments of reproch obiected, as if it were a base or contemptible thing to be Christians, to be Catholiques, to be Papistes No, al these and the like, are honorable and glorious titles; importing the true seruice of Christ, in vnitie of the Ca holique Church; and spiritual participation with the visible head therof, Christs Vicar in earth.</aside>
