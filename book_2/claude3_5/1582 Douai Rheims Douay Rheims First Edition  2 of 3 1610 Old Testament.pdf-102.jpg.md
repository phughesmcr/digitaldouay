# THE BOOKE

red before external, spiritual sacrifices, this of a contrite spirit is first in order, and maketh the way to the sacrifice of justice, because justice presupposeth repentance, and finally succeedeth sacrifice of praise, and thanksgiving.

## PSALME. LI.

*Dauid inuectiue against Doeg.*

Holie Dauid inueigheth against wicked Doeg a traitor. 7. prophecieth his ruine. 10. and his owne exaltation.

Vnto the end, vnderstanding to Dauid, <sup>1</sup> when Doeg the Idumeite came and told Saul: Dauid is come into the house of <sup>2</sup> Achimelech. (1. Reg. 22.)

[^1]: Of the race of Esau, half a Iew, but either an infidel, or fautor of Infidels, a spie for Saul, a persecutor of Dauid, & a murderer of Innocents. 1. Reg. 21. v. 7. 22.

[^2]: High priest, slaine with 84. more Priestes and others, because they were supposed to fauour Dauid. ibidem.

<sup>3</sup> WHY doest thou glorie in malice, which art mightie in iniquitie?

<aside>Thou persecutor Doeg, why art thou so malicious, to abuse thy credite with king Saul, to the murdering of innocents?</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Al the day hath thy tongue thought iniustice: as a sharp rasor thou hast done guile.

<aside>playing the part of a spie, in betraying to Saul, that I was with Achimelech?</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast loued malice more then benignitie: iniquitie rather then to speake equitie.

<aside>Though he told a truth, yet it was iniquitie to betray innocents.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Thou hast loued al wordes of precipitation, a deceitful tongue.

<aside>Thou shalt vtterly be destroyed. g & al thy race.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> Therfore wil God destroy thee for euer, he wil plucke thee out, & remoue thee out of thy tabernacle: & g thy roote out of the land of the liuing.

<sup>8</sup> The iust shal see, and feare, and shal laugh at him, and they <sup>9</sup> shal say: Behold the man, that hath not put God for his helper.

<aside>for a short time in this world.</aside>

But hath hoped in the multitude of his riches, and hath preuailed in his vanitie.

<sup>10</sup> But I as a fruitful oliue tree in the house of God, haue hoped in the mercie of God for euer: and for euer and euer.

<aside>Dauid prophecieth his owne exaltation, and conseruation of his seede in the kingdom of Israel.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> I wil confesse to thee for euer, because thou hast done it: and I wil expect thy name, because it is good in the sight of thy saintes:

<aside>Sing praises, and thankes to thee. i thy Goodnes, which agreeth to thy name.</aside>
