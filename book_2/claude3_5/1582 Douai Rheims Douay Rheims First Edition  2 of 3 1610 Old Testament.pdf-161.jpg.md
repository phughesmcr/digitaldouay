OF PSALMES 161

<aside>To the children of Core, a Psalme of Canticle.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> The foundations thereof in the holie *a* mountaynes:
<sup>2</sup> our Lord loueth the gates of Sion, aboue al the tabernacles of Iacob.

<aside>Christs Church was first founded in Ierusalem on whitsunday, Act 2 in mount Sion, which hath two toppes, in one of which the Temple stood, in the other Dauids towre or palace.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Glorious thinges are saide of thee, ô cittie of God.
<sup>4</sup> I wil be mindeful of *b* Raab, and Babylon knowing me.

<aside>The Prophets in the person of Christ, faith he wil conuert vnto his Apostles, and other Apostolical men, that they conuert al nations (as our Sauiour gaue expresse commission and commandment. Math. 28. Luc. 24. v. 47. Act. 1. v. 8.) *c* naming here Raab (which is Ægypt) and Babylon:</aside>

Behold *d* the foreners, and Tyre, & the people of the Æthiopians, these *e* were there.

<aside>The Philistims, Tyrians, Æthiopians, & the rest, shalbe regenerate in this Church, which for the assured certaintie therof (after the prophets maner of speaking) is affirmed in the preteritence, as if it were then donne.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Shal it not be said of Sion: Man and man, is borne in her; and *g* the Highest himselfe founded her?

<aside>It shal be reported, or one shal say to an other: Loe this and that man, al these and al these men are regenerate by Baptisme in the Church of Christ. *g* God himselfe, Christ God and Man, founded this Church.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Our Lord wil declare *h* in scriptures of peoples, and of princes: of those that haue bene in her.

<aside>The multitude of the elect is so great, that only God knoweth the number, *i* and the qualities of al sortes of Princes, Prelates, and Peoples.</aside>

<sup>7</sup> The *k* habitation in thee, is as it were of al reioycing.

<aside>Great spiritual ioy with peace of conscience, is in true Christian Catholiques in the militant Church; but the blessed haue the most absolute & secure ioy of al, in the Church triumphant.</aside>

PSALME LXXXVII.

*A faithful person sore and long afflicted, lamentably complaineth, praying to God, 15. not stil to repel him, being left desolate, 19. without al consolation of freindes.*

<aside>A prayer in long affliction the 7. key.</aside>

1 A Canticle of a Psalme, to the children of Core, vnto the end, for *a* Maheleth *b* to answer, *c* of vnderstanding to Eman the Ezrahite.

<aside>*a* An instrument of musike apt for lamentable songes. Not expressed in the title of some other Psalme. Perhaps because this Psalme noteth not anie consolation with mourning, as other Psalmes do, which are also prayers in affliction. As the 30. 37. 61. 73. *b* Neither is this word in anie other title. It is added here to admonish vs, that as this Psalme, and some others were songe by two quires, one answering the other, so we must in answer and imitation of Christ, suffer long and great afflictions with patience, seing he in his passion was left without ordinarie consolation. *c* By some interpreted [his bretheren.] For Christ (saith S. Augustin) vouchsafeth</aside>
