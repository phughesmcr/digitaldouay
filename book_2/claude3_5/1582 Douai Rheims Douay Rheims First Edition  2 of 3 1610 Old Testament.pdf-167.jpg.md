OF PSALMES.

promise concerning Davids seede, seemed to be fulfilled in him. But Salomon fell, and gave place of expectation to Christ: that because God neither can be deceived, nor deceive, he put not his promise in him, whom he knew would fall, but thou shalt see the true God, and exact his promise. A litle after Thou seekest the kingdom of the Iewes, it is not: thou seekest the Altar of the Iewes, it is not: thou seekest the sacrifice of the Iewes, it is not: thou seekest the priesthood of the Iewes, it is not. Whereupon he concludeth: Al these defectes came to the Iewes: yet was not Christ taken from them, but differed. Some Iewes beleved in him, and manie Gentiles. As the Psalmist prophesieth from the 47. verse to the end of this Psalme.

PSALME LXXXIX.

*Under the forme of prayer, the Psalmist describeth the shortnes of mans life Man rightly created fel by and other calamities. 7. Gods first iudgement. 13. but still his comfortable sinne into mi- mercies: 18. and perpetual regard of his owne worke.* series.

<sup>1</sup> A prayer *a* of Moyses the man of God:

<aside>a Some Expositors thincke Moyses was the author of this Psalme, and of the tenne next folowing. But others hold that David was author of al, and that Moyses his name is here put in the title by Esdras, because this Psalme is like to the prayer of Moyses, when the people prouoked Gods wrath by their sinnes in the desert, and because mans creation, fal, punishment, and Gods mercie towards him, are here described: which Moyses first writte, as going before the written law. And that Moyses made not this Psalme is probably gathered by the 10. verse, where the ordinarie age of man is described to be (in strength and vigore) seventie yeares, or of some fourscore: and the greater part (of the one or the other) is in labour and sorow. And it is evident (Deut. 34.) that Moyses liued in al an hundred and twentie yeares, and his eye was not dimme, neither were his teeth moued. So Aaron, Iosue, and others commonly liued longer then is here mentioned. But David was old and impotent at seventie yeares. 1. Reg. 1. S. Hilarion, liuing neere seventie yeares in his heremitage, S. Remigius governing the Church of Rhemes, seventie yeares, and the like are accounted to haue bene ful of dayes, and such as liued longer are reputed extraordinarie. Agane it is more euidently proued that Moyses was not author of the 94. and 95. Psalmes.</aside>

Lord, thou art made a refuge for vs: *b* from generation vnto generation.

<aside>b Alwayes from the beginning of the world to the end.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> Before *c* the mountaines were made, or the earth and the world formed: *d* from everlasting even vnto everlasting thou art God.

<aside>c The Prophet sheweth that the world was created in and with time, not eternal.</aside>

<aside>d And that only God is eternal.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Turne not away man into humiliation: thou saidst: Be converted ye children of men.

<aside>e God hath often saide, that he would not the death of sinners, but rather that they be converted and live for ever.</aside>
