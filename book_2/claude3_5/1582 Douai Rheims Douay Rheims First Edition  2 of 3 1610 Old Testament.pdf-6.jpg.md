# PROEMIAL ANNOTATIONS

he) al greatnes of vertue, and is not here the right square of iustice? is not the comlines of chastitie; the consummation of prudence? is not whatsoever may be called good, lerned in the Psalmes? Here is the knowlege of God; the clere prenunciation of Christ to come in flesh; the hope of general Resurrection; feare of torments; promise of glorie; revelation of mysteries. Even al good thinges are here, as in a common great treasure, laide vp and heaped together.

See then and observe here (Christian reader) the admirable wisdom, and goodnes of God. The meanes of mans salvation being so disposed, that his owne free consent, and cooperation is therto necessarily required, according to that most approved doctrin of the same S. Augustin: *Qui creavit te sine te; non iustificabit sine te. He that created thee, without thee, doth not iustifie thee without thee*: to helpe our weaknes, and sweetly to draw our mindes, otherwise averse from travail and paine, the Holie Ghost hath ordained that in final towne, and in pleasant maner, we may attaine necessarie knowlege of God, & our selves, easely kepe the same in memorie, and dayly put in practise our chiefest dutie, in serving and praising God, by singing, reading, or hearing these divine Psalmes: which one booke (as everie one shal be able to lerne it, more or lesse perfectly) openeth and sheweth the way, to vnderstand al other Scriptures, and so to finde, & enioy the hidden treasures of Gods word: in like maner as a key openeth a lock. For the whole sacred *Bible is a sealed Booke*, and not rightly vnderstood, til the seale, or lock be opened, by the key of Gods spirite, geving knowlege: which the Holie Ghost, amongst other wayes, inspireth very often, by sacred Musike or Psalmodie. As S. Gregorie noteth in holie Scripture (4. Reg. 3. v. 15.) where Eliseus not yet knowing Gods wil in a particular case, called for a Psalmist (or player on instruments) and *when the Psalmist sang, the hand of our Lord came vpon Eliseus*, and presently he prescribing what should be donne, procured plentie of water without rayne, where was
