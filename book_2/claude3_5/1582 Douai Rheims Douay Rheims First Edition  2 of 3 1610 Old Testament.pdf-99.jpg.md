# OF PSALMES.

## PSALME. L.

*King Dauid in great sorow for his sinnes of adultrie and murder, most seriously prayeth God of his manifold mercies to remitte and purge al his offences, and paines due to them. 13. He desireth unto him the grace of the Holie Ghost, lost by his sinnes: 15. that he may teach others (as in dede his singular example may teach the whole world true penance) 19. contrition of hart, worthely to offer sacrifices, for the whole Church.*

<sup>1</sup> Vnto a the end, a Psalme of David, <sup>2</sup> when Nathan the Prophet came to him, after that he had sinned with Bethsabee.

[^1]: (2. Reg. 12.)

<aside>a Pertayning not only to Dauid, but also to al penitentes, especially of the new testament</aside>

<sup>3</sup> HAVE mercie on me Ã´ God, *b* according to thy great mercie.

[^2]: *b* My sinnes being very great, nede thy great mercie.

And according to *c* the multitude of thy commiserations, take away myne iniquitie.

<aside>c Yea manie sortes of thy mercies: not only remission of the crimes, but also mitigation of the paines due for the same. Thy merciful graces to be truly sorie, to make some part of satisfaction, to beware hereafter not to fal againe, to geue better example of penance, and of vertuous life, and to perseuer to the end.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> Wash me *d* more amply from mine iniquitie: & *e* cleanse me from my sinne.

[^3]: *d* O God thou hast forgeuen me, and taken away my sinnes, as thy prophet hath told me (2. Reg. 12. v. 13.) but my soule is not fully purified, neither is al paine remitted. Cleanse also the dregges that remaine, and al habites and inclinations to sinne. As our Sauiour afterwards taught: (Ioan. 13. v. 10.) He that is washed nedeth not sauing to wash his feete (il affections and reliques of former sinnes) but is cleane wholy.

<sup>5</sup> Because I do know myne iniquitie: and my sinne is *g* before me alwaies.

[^4]: *f* Whiles I did not know: not consider nor acknowledge my sinnes, I could not be forgeuen, but now I know and acknowledge them: *g* and I cease not to consider of them with sorow.

<sup>6</sup> To thee *h* onely haue I sinned, and haue done euil before thee: that thou mayst *i* be iustified in thy words, and mayst *k* ouercome when thou art iudged.

[^5]: *h* Principally (for so this particle [only] here signifieth) the enormities of my sinnes consist, in that I haue offended thy Diuine Goodnes and Maiestie, the King of the worlde, immortal, inuisible, onlie God, to whom is due al honour and glorie for euer and euer. 1. Tim. 1. v. 17. Thine which hast promised forgeuenes to al sinners that truly conuert, shal herein be iustified by receiuing me againe to grace: *i* and ouerthrow thy calumniators, that iudge wickedly of thy proceedings, as if either thy iustice or mercie were preiudiced.

<sup>7</sup> For behold *l* I was conceiued in iniquities: & my mother conceiued me in sinnes.

[^6]: *l* I and al are borne in original sinne, the reliques wherof, concupiscence and weakenes incline vs to other sinnes, which we haue added. In regard of which our infirmitie, thy mercie is readie to recal vs, and help vs.
