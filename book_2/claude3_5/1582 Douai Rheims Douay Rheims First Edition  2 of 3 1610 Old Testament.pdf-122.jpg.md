<sup>5</sup>Sing to God, say a Psalme to his name: *a* make way to him, who *e* mounteth vpon the west, *f* Lord is his name.

[^1]: Resist not Gods inspiration, but receiue it with ioy and thankes. *e* who triumpheth ouer death. *f* God is Lord, not only of these or those nations, countries or other creatures, but absolutely and vniuersally of al.

Reioyce ye in his sight, they shal be trubled at the presence of him: <sup>6</sup>the father of orphanes, and iudge of widowes. God in his *g* holie place: <sup>7</sup>God that maketh men to inhabite *h* of one manner in a house.

[^2]: That is the true holie Church, which hath *h* vnitie in doctrin, touching faith and maners. & Cyprian *k* That bringeth forth them, *i* that be bound, in strength, likewise them, that *k* exasperate, that dwel *l* in sepulchers.

[^3]: That be bond in sinne: *k* euen rebellious willes are altered by Gods mercie, and freely embrace his law. *l* also the dead and drie hartes that cared not for spiritual thinges, are softened, and quickned with new grace.

<sup>8</sup>O God *m* when thou wentest forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst passe through the desert.

[^4]: The benefites bestowed on the Israelites, are written in the bookes of Moyses, Iosue, and Iudges.

<sup>9</sup>The earth was moued, and the heauens also distilled, at the presence of the God of Sina, at the face of the God of Israel.

<sup>10</sup>Voluntarie rayne shalt thou separate ô God to thine inheritance: and it was *o* weakned, but thou hast perfected it.

[^5]: Not mans deseruing, but Gods mere good wil, and free grace caused Christ to come, and by himselfe and his Apostles to preach the Euangelical doctrin, which watereth the whole world, *o* God chose the weake, but made them strong.

<sup>11</sup>Thy *p* liuing creatures shal dwel in it: thou hast prepared *q* in thy sweetnes for the poore, ô God.

[^6]: Those whom thou hast chosen, and so made thy owne peculiar people, shal enioy this grace. *q* Thou gauest Manna in the desert, the B. Sacrament in the new testament.

<sup>12</sup>Our Lord shal geue *r* the word to them that euangelize *s* with great powre.

[^7]: God geueth to the preacher what to speake, *s* and to some he geueth also powre to worke miracles, in confirmation of their doctrin. Mat. 16.

<sup>13</sup>The king of hostes the beloued of the beloued: and to the beautie of the house, to diuide the spoyles.

[^8]: Some potent king, or (as it is in the Hebrew) *v* kinges being beloued, of the beloued of God, the only Sonne of God, shal yeld themselues to the same beloued Sonne of God: *v* which shal redound to the glorie and beautie of his Church, gayning such spiritual prayes from the diuel.

<sup>14</sup>If ye sleepe among the middest of lottes, the winges of a doue layde ouer with siluer, and the hinder parts of her backe in the palenes of gold.

[^9]: If you be in such danger, that the aduersaries cast dice, or lottes for your persons, and goodes, yet you shal be deliuered, as if a doue, with her glistering fethers, like siluer and gold, flie away into a secure place, without losse or diminution, but rather with increase of grace.
