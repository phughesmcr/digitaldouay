<sup>4</sup> For the sparow also hath found her an house: and the turtledoue a nest for her selfe, where she may lay her young ones.

<aside>As sparowes by natural instinct seeking habitations, finde houses to dwel in, & and turtles haue nestes, wherin to lay their young ones: so faithful soules seeke to dwel in heauen, and in the meane time to lay vp good workes within the Catholique Church, out of which (sayth S. Augustin in this place) how good soeuer workes do seeme (as when paganes, and heretikes feede the hungrie, cloth the naked, receiue strangers into their houses, visite the sicke, comforte prisoners) being not laid in the nest, are conculcated as, & contemned. For shal be crushed in peeces: they shal not be conserued, they shal not be kept: but (that such workes may be profitable and be conserued) they must be donne in true faith, in the Catholique faith, in societie of the vnitie of the Church.</aside>

Thine *b* altars ô Lord of hostes: my King, and my God.

[^1]

<sup>5</sup> Blessed are they, that dwel in thy house ô Lord: for euer and euer they shal praise thee.

<aside>The Catholique Church.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> Blessed is the man, whose helpe is from thee: he *k* hath <sup>7</sup> disposed ascension in his hart, in the vaile of teares, in the place, which he hath appointed.

[^2]

<sup>8</sup> For *m* the lawgeuer shal geue *n* blessing, they shal goe from vertue into vertue: the God of goddes shal be seene in Sion.

[^3]

<sup>9</sup> Lord God of hostes heare my prayer: receiue with thine eare ô God of Iacob.

<sup>10</sup> Behold ô God our protectour: and *q* looke vpon the face of thy Christ.

[^4]

<sup>11</sup> Because *r* better is one day in thy courtes, aboue thousands.

<aside>In respect of the future retribution, which euerie one shal receiue according to their desertes, one day in Gods Church is better then thousands out of it.</aside>

I haue chosen to be *s* an abiect in the house of my God, rather then to dwel *t* in the tabernacles of sinners.

<aside>And better to be in the poorest state of Catholique Christians, y then in greatest palaces or highest dignities amongst sinners.</aside>

[^1]: VVorkes are good, and highly lauded vp when they are donne in vnitie, and participation of Gods Altares, the most proper places of Diuine Seruice, of external Sacrifice in this life, and spiritual sacrifice of perfect praise in eternal glorie, where al Sainctes without ceasing sing: Holie, holie, holie, Lord God of hostes, Isaiæ 6. APOC. 4.

[^2]: The iust by Gods grace and helpe do resolue to ascend by steppes and degrees, from vertue to vertue (v. 8.) euen to heauen, though it be now in this vaile of teares, by reason of mans sinne, who otherwise was before sinne in paradise, a place of delight.

[^3]: Christ our lawgeuer, n geueth abundant graces, o with continual increase. p but our only omnipotent God, is to be seene by this effect of his grace, in the Church and not elsewhere.

[^4]: Agreeably to this the Church maketh al her petitions, concluding al prayers; By Christ our Lord.
