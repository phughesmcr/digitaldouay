THE BOOKE OF PSALMES.

<sup>3</sup> Prayse ye him in the sound of trumpet: prayse ye him on psalter, and harpe.

Out of this your great an infinite desire, let your tongues sound and sing divine praises, as wel with voice, as musical instruments. Whereof the most usual in the Tabernacle and Temple were these: Trumpet, Psalter, Harpe, Timbrel, Organ and Cymbal.

<sup>4</sup> Prayse ye him on timbrel and quire: prayse ye him on stringes, and organ.

[^1] By the way the Psalmist interpreteth again two special thinges, which make perfect harmonie, without which no instrument is grateful to God: Virtue amongst his servants, signified by the Quire of consonant voices: and mortification of passions, signified by Stringes, which are made of dead beastes bowels.

<sup>5</sup> Prayse ye him on wel sounding cymbals: prayse ye him on cymbals of iubilation: <sup>6</sup>let euerie spirit prayse our Lord. Alleluia.

[^2] Man created of corruptible bodie and immortal soule, is finally admonished to praise our Lord, over and above the praises of al other corporal creatures: who also is more especially bond therto then Angels, because God hath vouchsafed to make himself Man, to redeme man that was lost by sinne, and to endew him with new grace, and so bring him to everlasting glorie, where with holie Angels, man also for ever & ever shal praise our Lord, with hart, voice, and iubilation of spirite, singing as the Psalmist concludeth, Alleluia.

ANNOTATIONS. PSALM CL.

[^3] The number of Psalmes signifieth the agreement of the old and new Testament.

S. Augustin in the conclusion of his Enarrations, or Sermons vpon the Psalmes, explicateth a mysterie in the number of an hundred and fiftie, signifying the concord of the two Testaments. For in the old testament they kept the Sabbath, which is the seventh day: in the new we keepe our Lords day, after the sabbath, that is, the eight: which seven and eight (making fiftene) multiplied by tenne, signifying the Law of tenne commandments, rise vnto 150. Againe seven multiplied by seven make 49. whereto one (to witte the eight) being added make fiftie, which multiplied by three, signifying the B Trinitie, make 150. Neither (saith he) without cause to this great Doctor, that the first fiftie end with a Psalme of Penance, craving mercie & remission of sinnes: the second with Mercie and Iudice, which God promiseth in the Redemption, Iustification, and Salvation of men: the last with Divine Praises, signifying, that by condemning our selves, through Gods mercie we may be iustified, and so beginne in this life, which is to be perfected in the next, to praise our Lord, as S. Paul admonisheth, with Psalmes, Hymnes, and Spiritual Songues. Conclu Colloq. ding with the two verses, appointed by S. Damasus Pope, to be added in the end of al Psalmes, and is observed ever since his time by tradition in the *An. 1. whole Church: *An. 384.

Glorie to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the Holie Ghost:
As it was in the beginning, and now, and ever, unto worldes of worldes [in eternitie without end] Amen.

[^1]: By the way the Psalmist interpreteth again two special thinges, which make perfect harmonie, without which no instrument is grateful to God: Virtue amongst his servants, signified by the Quire of consonant voices: and mortification of passions, signified by Stringes, which are made of dead beastes bowels.

[^2]: Man created of corruptible bodie and immortal soule, is finally admonished to praise our Lord, over and above the praises of al other corporal creatures: who also is more especially bond therto then Angels, because God hath vouchsafed to make himself Man, to redeme man that was lost by sinne, and to endew him with new grace, and so bring him to everlasting glorie, where with holie Angels, man also for ever & ever shal praise our Lord, with hart, voice, and iubilation of spirite, singing as the Psalmist concludeth, Alleluia.

[^3]: The number of Psalmes signifieth the agreement of the old and new Testament.
