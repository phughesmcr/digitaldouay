<sup>7</sup> Their iniquitie hath proceded as it were of fatte : they haue passed into the affection of the hart.

[^1] Whatsoeuer mischief came in their mind, they feared not to committe it in fact.

<sup>8</sup> They haue thought, and haue spoken wickednes they haue spoken iniquitie : on high.

[^2] boldly extolling their owne wordes and workes, and despising others.

<sup>9</sup> They haue sette their mouth vnto heauen : ad their tongue hath passed in the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Therfore wil my people k returne here : and l ful daies shal be found in them.

[^3] For this prosperitie of the wicked, some of Gods people wil fall from the right way, l and their dayes wil abound with calamities.

<sup>17</sup> Vntil I may enter into the sanctuarie of God : and may vnderstand concerning their latter endes.

<sup>18</sup> But yet p for guiles thou hast put it to them : thou hast cast them downe whiles they were eleuated.

[^7] But only in general we are taught, that euils are prepared for the guiltie, or deceiuers, q pride, and other sinnes of the wicked.

<sup>19</sup> How are they brought into desolation, they haue failed sodanly : they haue perished for their iniquitie.

<sup>20</sup> As the dreame of them that rise Ã´ Lord, in thy citie thou shalt bring their r image to nothing.

[^8] Not real but imaginarie felicitie.
