<sup>37</sup> And they sowed fildes, and planted vineyardes: and they made fruite of natiuitie.

<sup>38</sup> And he blessed them, and they were multiplied excedingly: and their beastes he lessened not.

<sup>39</sup> And they were few: and were vexed by the tribulation of euiles, and with sorow.

<sup>40</sup> Contempt was powred out vpon princes: and he made them wander where was no way, and not in the way.

<sup>41</sup> And he helped the poore out of pouertie: and made families as sheepe.

<sup>42</sup> The iust shal see, and shal reioyce: & al iniquitie shal stoppe her mouth.

<sup>43</sup> Who is wise and wil keepe these thinges? and wil vnderstand the mercies of our Lord?

PSALME CVII.

*Dauid singeth prayses for benefites receiued.*

*The royal prophet promiseth, 5. and rendereth praises to God, 7. for his deliuerie from troubles, and aduancement in the kingdom, 13. praying God stil to helpe man in infirmitie.*

A Canticle [^1] of Psalme, to Dauid himselfe.

[^2] <sup>2</sup> MY hart is readie ô God, my hart is readie: I wil sing and wil sing in my glorie.

<sup>3</sup> Arise my glorie, arise psalter, and harpe: I wil arise early:

<sup>4</sup> I wil confesse to thee in peoples ô Lord: and I wil sing to thee in the Nations.

[^3] <sup>5</sup> Because thy mercie is great aboue the heauens: and thy truth euen to the cloudes.

<sup>6</sup> Be exalted aboue the heauens ô God, and thy glorie ouer al the earth: <sup>7</sup> that thy beloued may be deliuered.

<sup>8</sup> Saue with thy righthand, and heare me: God spake in his holie:

[^1]: a This Psalme was songe with instruments beginning the musike, and voices folowing. The former part of this Psalme to the 7. verse, is the same in sense, and almost in wordes, with the latter part of the 56. Psalme, from the 8. verse.

[^2]: King Dauid subdued not only some partes of Chanaan, not subiect to the Israelites before (1. Par. 18.) but also brought the Philistims, Moabites, Ammonites, Idumeans, Amalechites, the kinges of Soba, Syria, and Emath, to pay tribute, 2. Reg. 8. 1. Par. 18. 1. Yet al these victories and conquestes were but a figure of Christes power and dominion in al nations. And therfore, the rest of this Psalme, by S. Augustin, and other fathers iudgement, was rather prophetically vttered by Dauid in the person of Christ, and more perfectly performed by Christ in his Church, then historically spoken of Dauid himselfe.

[^3]: :: The rest of this Psalme is the same with the latter part of the 59. from the 7. verse.
