# Proemial Annotations

forme (as S. Ierom, and S. Bede suppose) of the Greke, letter Î” delta, because as that instrument reacheth sound from aboue, so we should attend to heauenlie vertues, which come from aboue: Likewise vsing the harpe, which signifyeth mortification of the flesh, & other instruments, which signifie and teach other vertues, we must finally referre al to Gods glorie, reioyce spiritually in hart, and render al praise to God.

[^1]: Other instruments make consorte with the Psalter.

[^2]: Al vertues are referred to Gods honour.

## Concerning interpretation of holie Scriptures

AS Prophecie (or other holie Scripture) was not at anie time by mans wil, but the (Prophetes) holie men of God spake, inspired by the Holie Ghost: so no prophecie (nor explication) of Scripture, is made by priuate interpretation. 2. Pet. 1. but by the same Spirite wherewith it was written, which our Sauiour gaue to the Church, to abide for euer, the Spirite of truth; to teach al truth. *Ioan. 14. 16. Neither pertayneth it to euerie one, to discerne the true spirite, but to some. 1. Cor. 12.*

Holie Scriptures consist not in reading, but in vnderstanding. *S. Ierom Dialog. aduers. Luciferianos.*

The wordes of holie Scripture are so to be vnderstood, as holie men, the Saincts of God, haue vnderstood them, *S. Aug. ser. 18. de verb. Domini. Men must lerne of men, not expect knowlege immediately of God, nor only by Angels. Idem, in prologo Doct. Christ.*

There be some thinges, mentioned in holie Scripture, which God wil haue hidden, and those are not to be curiously searched. *S. Amb. li. 1. c. 7. de vocat. Gentium.*

By those thinges, which to vs are hidden in holie Scripture, our humilitie is proued, *S. Greg. ho. 17. super Ezech.*

[^3]: Scriptures are to be expounded by the common spirit of the Church, not by priuate men.

[^4]: They consist in vnderstanding.

[^5]: Holy Fathers do best expound them.

[^6]: Some Mysteries are hidden.

[^7]: They proue our humilitie.
