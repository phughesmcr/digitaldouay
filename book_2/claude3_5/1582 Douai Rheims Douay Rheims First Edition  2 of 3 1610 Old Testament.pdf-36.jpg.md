ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XV.

5. *Our lord the portion of myn inheritance*] Christ whom the Iewes expected as their earthlie conquerour, that should advance himself and them temporally in this world, was in dede, as the children and multitude called him, king of Israel. (*Ioan. 12.*) At which time (as also before) he exercised temporal iurisdiction, in correcting abuses in the Temple (*Mat. 21. Ioan. 2.*) And when Pilate demanded of him, if he were king (*Ioan. 18. v. 37*) he answered: *Thou saist, that I am a king*. For this I was borne, and for this came I into the world, that I should geue testimonie to the truth. And though he answered withal, that his kingdom (to witte the possession, and vse therof) was not of this world, yet Pilate by Gods providence, wrote the title, and would not alter it, IESVS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE IEWES. But Christs chief inheritance, and reward of his merites is God himself, as here he professeth by his prophet David : which is also the only true & perfect inheritance of al Christes subiects, wherefore Clergie men more particularly professe the same, when they first enter into Ecclesiastical state, addicting and dedicating them selves to serve God in Ecclesiastical function, not for temporal inheritance, but for a better lotte, God himself, who is al Good, and most perfect goodnes, true riches, and eternal inheritance. In which election of state to live and serve God in, everie Clergie man saith : *Our Lord is the portion of myn inheritance, and of my cuppe : Thou art he that wil restore myn inheritance vnto me*. Man calleth this inheritance, because he was created to serve God, and for his service to inherite God : which reward though he lost by sinne, yet everie one returning to Gods service, and persevering therin, recovereth by Christ, new right and title to the same inheritance, performing their duties in their several vocations, some teaching in the world, but not loving it: others sequestered from secular affayres, duly administring sacred offices, more peculiarly called Divine service.
