<sup>14</sup> Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him for meate to the peoples of the Ethiopians.[^1]

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast broken vp fountanes, and torrentes: thou hast dried the riuers of Ethan.

<aside>t riuen water out of rockes, I made passage ouer Iordan.</aside>

<sup>16</sup> The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast made the morning and the sunne.

<sup>17</sup> Thou hast made al the coasts of the earth: the summer and the spring thou hast formed them.

<sup>18</sup> Be mindeful of this, the enimie hath vpbraided our Lord: and a foolish people hath prouoked thy name.

<sup>19</sup> Deliuer not to beasts the soules that confesse to thee: and the soules of thy poore forget not for euer.

<sup>20</sup> Haue respect vnto thy testament: because they that are obscure of the earth, are filled with houses of iniquitie.

<aside>t Ignorant, blind, and barbarous infidels, lodge al kindes of iniquitie in their consciences.</aside>

<sup>21</sup> Let not the humble be turned away being confounded: the poore and needy shal praise thy name.

<aside>v and therfore it is vnmeete, that faithful people should be in bondage vnder them.</aside>

<sup>22</sup> Arise God, iudge thy cause: be mindful of those thy reproches, that are from the foolish man al the day.

<aside>w These foolish audacious men do continually blaspheme al holie thinges.</aside>

<sup>23</sup> Forget not the voices of thine enimies: the pride of them that hate thee, hath ascended alwaies.

<aside>x Omitte not to punish them, y seing they are obstinate and obdurate in pride, and in hatred.</aside>

PSALME LXXIIII.

*Christ (with his Assisters) wil iudge the whole world, at the last day: in General the meane time exhorteth sinners to amend their life: 7. for none shal Iudgement, escape iust iudgement. 11. The wicked shal be punished, and the good the 9. key. rewarded.*

1 Vnto the end, a Corrupt not, a Psalme of Canticle to Asaph.

<aside>a Either this was the beginning of a songe, to the tune wherof this Psalme was song; as some Hebrew Rabbins testifie; or as S. Augustin and other fathers explicate, the Septuagint do admonish vs, by occasion of this Psalme, not to faile in our hope, for that God wil in no case violate his promise for our purpose, but wil render to euerie one in the day of Iudgement, as they deserue.</aside>
