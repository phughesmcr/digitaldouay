OF PSALMES.

17. For thy fathers there are borne sonnes to thee. The Apostles begotte thee (O Christ an Church) they were sent, they preached, they are the fathers. But could they be always corporally with vs? Could anie of them tarie here til this time? could they tarie to the time yet to come? But was therefore the Church left desolate by their departure? God forbid. For thy fathers, sonnes are borne to thee. What is this for thy fathers, sonnes are borne to thee? The Apostles were sent fathers, in place of the Apostles sonnes are borne to thee; Byshops are appointed. For whence came the Byshops borne, that are at this day through al the world? the Church herselfe calleth them fathers, she begate them, and appointed them in the seates of the fathers. Do not therefore thinke thy self desolate (o christian Church) because thou seest not Peter, seest not Paul: for thou seest not them by whom thou wast borne, but of thyne issue Fatherhood is sprong to thee. For thy fathers, formes are borne to thee, thou shalt make them princes ouer al the earth. This is the Catholique Church. Her children are made princes ouer al the earth: her sonnes are constitute for fathers. Let them acknowledge that are cut of: let them come to the vnitie, be they brought into the temple of the king. Thus S. Augustin.

PSALME. XLV.

*The Church in persecution acknowledgeth Gods perpetual defence, 5. making her thereby more glorious, 10. sometimes granting rest (11. God himself chasing the persecuters) and euer protecting her.*

<aside>Belonging to the Church of Christ. b As wel the causes, why God suffereth his Church to be persecuted, as his assured protection in difficulties, are hidden secretes to the world.</aside>

1. Vnto the end, to the sonnes of Core, for b the secretes.

2. Our God is a refuge, c and strength: an d helper in tribulations, which e haue found vs exceedingly.

<aside>A refuge is not secure for one man is notable alwayes to defend an other: but God is a sure and strong refuge. d euer able and in conuenient time willing to helpe e This whole world is ful of tribulations, but the Church suffereth the greatest in the first persecutions, & shal suffer as great in the time of Antichrist. English Catholiques suffer most of al nations in this age, and can not be suppressed, but stil increase in number and fortitude.</aside>

3. <sup>†</sup> Therefore wil we f not feare when g the earth shal be troubled: and h mountaines transported into the hart of the sea.

<aside>f Therefore al Catholiques know, that the whole Church can not faile g though very manie, as now in England, h and very eminent persons, as some noblemen, and some Priestes haue reuolted, yet al wil not.</aside>

4. <sup>†</sup> Their waters haue sounded, and were trubled: the mountaines were trubled in his strength.

5. <sup>†</sup> The violence of the riuer i maketh the citie of God ioyful: the Highest hath sanctified his tabernacle.

<aside>i Such hard persecution and affliction exciteth themselues more diligently, and to reioyce in Gods grace, by which they stand fast.</aside>

6. <sup>†</sup> God is in the middes thereof, it shal not be moued: God wil helpe it k in the morning early.

<aside>k before the heate of persecution shal increase al, for the elect the dayes of tribulation are shortened.</aside>
