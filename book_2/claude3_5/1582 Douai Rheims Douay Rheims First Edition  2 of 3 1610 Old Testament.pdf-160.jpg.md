<sup>5</sup> Because thou ô Lord art swete, and milde: and of much mercie to al that inuocate thee.

[^1] Sixtly because God of his owne nature is benigne, readie to bestow benefits. Seuenthly, he is meeke to remitte offences. Eightly, he is merciful to mitigate the punishment, to those that make recourse vnto him. For these causes we may as foloweth.

<sup>6</sup> Receiue ô Lord my praier with thine eares: and attend to the voice of my petition.

<sup>7</sup> In the day of my tribulation I haue called to thee: because thou hast heard me.

<sup>8</sup> There is not the like to thee amongst goddes ô Lord: and there is not according to thy workes.

[^2] Vocation of Gentiles.

[^3] They shal come by faith, and glorifie God by good workes. Mat. 5. v. 17.

<sup>9</sup> Al nations whatsoeuer thou hast made, shal come, and shal adore before thee ô Lord: and they shal glorifie thy name.

<sup>10</sup> Because thou art great and doing meruelous thinges: thou onlie art God.

<sup>11</sup> Conduct me ô Lord in thy way, and I wil walke in thy truth: let my hart reioyce that it may feare thy name.

[^4] Confession of praise.

<sup>12</sup> I wil confesse to thee ô Lord my God with al my hart, and wil glorifie thy name for euer:

<sup>13</sup> because thy mercie is great vpon me: and thou hast deliuered my soule out of the lower hel.

[^5] From the state of eternal damnation.

<sup>14</sup> O God the wicked are risen vp vpon me, and the synagogue of the mightie haue sought my soule: and they haue not set thee in their sight.

<sup>15</sup> And thou ô Lord the God of compassion and merciful, patient, and of much mercie, and true.

[^6] In performing al promises.

<sup>16</sup> Haue respect to me, and haue mercie on me, giue thine empire to thy seruant: and saue the sonne of thy handmaide.

<aside>A digression (as al prophecies) of Christes Empyre and Kingdom the Church, geuen to him, being the sonne of an immaculate virgin, the handmaide of God.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> Make with me a signe vnto God, that they may see which hate me, and may be confounded: v because thou ô Lord hast holpen me.

<aside>The chief and principal signe of Christe, and his Churches glorie, is his Resurrection, prefigured in Ionas. VVherby al enemies are confounded, either to their conuersion, or to eternal damnation. See S. Augustin.</aside>
