OF PSALMES 257

<sup>5</sup> I was mindful of old dayes, I haue meditated in al thy workes: in the factes of thy handes did I meditate.

<aside>In this case I consider, how God hath heretofore shewed his goodnes towards me, and others.</aside>

<sup>6</sup> I haue stretched forth my handes to thee: my soule is as earth without water unto thee.[^1]

<sup>7</sup> Heare me quickly ô Lord: my spirite hath faynted.

<aside>In great tentations Gods grace and helpe is more presently nedeful to preuent our weaknes, lest we yeld consent.</aside>

Turne not away thy face from me: *m* and I shal be like to them that descend into the lake.[^2]

<sup>8</sup> Make me heare thy mercie *o* in the morning: because I haue hoped in thee.[^3]

Make knowen to me, wherein I may walke: *p* because I haue lifted vp my soule to thee.[^4]

<sup>9</sup> Deliuer me from mine enemies ô Lord, to thee I haue fled: <sup>10</sup> teach me to doe thy wil, because thou art my God.

<sup>11</sup> Thy good spirite wil conduct me into the right way: for thy name sake ô Lord thou wilt quicken me, in thine equitie. <sup>12</sup> Thou wilt bring forth my soule out of tribulation: † and in thy mercie thou wilt destroy mine enemies.

And thou wilt destroy al, that afflict my soule: because I am thy seruant.

<aside>doth remitte his sinnes by the holie Sacraments, and iustifieth him, protecteth him, and wil bring him out of al dangers of spiritual or temporal enemies.</aside>

PSALME CXLIII.

*The royal Prophet thanketh God, for al his victories, and possession of the kingdom. 3. Admiring Gods benignitie towards man, 5. prayeth to be stil protected from al enimies, 9. promiseth a new songe of prayse, 11. describeth the vanitie of worldlie men, 15. concluding that true felicitie is in seruing God.*

<aside>A Psalme of Dauid, against Goliath.</aside>

<aside>Because this was Dauids first, and a very notable victorie, the Septuagint Interpreters make mention of Goliath in this title.</aside>

BLESSED be our Lord my God, who *b* teacheth my handes to battel; and my fingers to warre.

<aside>God made Dauid a warrier, and victorer against Goliath, without anie former training in armes.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> My

[^1]: Stretching forth handes a ceremonie in prayer, wherby the suppliant is made more attentiue, and also declareth some paine for part of satisfaction. A mans mind without Gods illumination is drie and barren.

[^2]: *m* If God leaue man without special and continual grace, he wil fal *n* into sinne, as into a deepe lake, from whence without helpe he can not rise vp againe.

[^3]: *o* In the first assault of tentations.

[^4]: *p* Seing by thy grace I haue begunne to pray vnto thee.
