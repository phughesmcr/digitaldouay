OF PSALMES.

<sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, a to the sonnes of Core a Psalme.

<aside>a In this and diuers other titles, both before and yet ensuing, is said, To the sonnes, or, for the sonnes of Core, a Psalme, or Canticle, or vnderstanding & the like: but in no place, a Psalme, Canticle &c. of the sonnes of Core, which no way proueth that they were the authores of such Psalmes, but rather the contrarie.</aside>

<sup>2</sup>HEARE these thinges b al ye Gentiles: receiue with your eares al ye, that c inhabite the earth.

<aside>b Al ye nations and sortes of people, c that dwel vpon the earth, lerne this lesson which I wil teach you.</aside>

<sup>3</sup>Al ye earthly persons, and children of men: together in one the rich and the poore.

<sup>4</sup>My mouth shal speake wisedom, and the meditation of my hart prudence.

<sup>5</sup>I wil d incline mine eare vnto a parable: I wil e open my proposition f on a Psalter.

<aside>d Holie Dauid harkened to God inspiring him, e and declared to others that which he receiued from God, f not only by his penne of tongue, but also for better instilling it into their mindes he sounded it vpon this instrument called the Psalter, which had tenne stringes, signifying the obseruation of the tenne commandments.</aside>

<sup>6</sup>g Why shal I feare in the euil day? h the iniquitie of my heele shal compasse me.

<aside>g What especial thing is there in this life, why or for which I or anie haue cause to feare the dreadful day of iudgement? h Many thinges we must feare, iniquitie, by which any supplanteth, defraudeth, oppresseth, or anie way wrongeth others, for that wil inclose the offender in the sentence of eternal damnation.</aside>

<sup>7</sup>They i that trust in their strength: and glorie in the multitude of their riches.

<aside>i Such be they that trust in their present power, riches, or other worldlie thing.</aside>

<sup>8</sup>A k brother doth not redeme, l man shal redeme: he shal not geue vnto God his reconciliation.

<aside>k A mans owne brother can not helpe a sinner in that day, l much lesse anie other man, so the Hebrew phrase by repeating, vnderstadeth an other negatiue particle.</aside>

<sup>9</sup>And the price of the redemption of his owne soule: and he <sup>10</sup>shal m labour for euer, n and m shal liue yet vnto the end.

<aside>m stil suffer paine, n and not dye, but liue in eternal torments.</aside>

<sup>11</sup>He shal not see death, when he shal see o the wise dying p the vnwise, and q the foole shal perish together.

<aside>o Alboth wise and foolish do dye temporally: but the wise liuing in eternal ioy, the foolish liue in eternal paine, p those that beleeue not anie other life after this, q and those that beleeuing an other life, yet liue badly in this, shal perish in eternal damnation.</aside>

<sup>12</sup>And they shal leaue their riches to strangers: and their r sepulchers their s houses for euer.

<aside>r They shal neuer returne from their sepulchers, s to enioy againe their houses and earthlie possessions.</aside>

Their Tabernacles in generation and generation: they haue called t names in their landes.

<aside>t Which vainly they labour to establish in their posteritie.</aside>
