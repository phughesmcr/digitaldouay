### ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. VIII.

1. Presses.] Most Hebrew Doctors say the word gittith, may either signifie the place, where this Psalme was made, or the musical instrument, on which it was song. But most Christian Doctors expound it literally of Christes Passion.

[^1]: a Belonging to the newe Testament. b Suffering of Christ, and of Christians.

[^2]: c God the lord of al by creation, is our singular lord, that belene and trust in him. d God more excellent then the heauens, he being the creator, they a creature.

[^3]: e fulfilled when Christ coming into Ierusalem, children sang Ozanna Mat. 21.

[^4]: f The Sonne in assumpted humane nature became lesse then Angels.

[^5]: g But in him mans nature is exalted aboue Angels. h Christ the Lord of al creatures.

[^6]: i yea of Angels. Heb. 2. k Not only al reasonable creatures, but beastes, and other thinges obey him. The sea and the windes obey him. Mat. 8.

[^7]: l The same end & beginning signifie, that as God was meruelous in creating man in so happie state, that if he would, he might haue auoided both sinne & death: so he is meruelous in that he so rewardeth the blessed in the resurrection, that they can neither sinne nor dye.
