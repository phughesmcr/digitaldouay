Againe after the captiuitie, the Citie was repared, the Temple reedified, and the whole land receiued and enioyed manie blessinges. But al this was no more then a figure of the excellent benefites here prophecied, and more euidently verified in Christs Catholique Church: partly here militant in the whole world, and especially in the glorious Ierusalem, and Sion, the perfect vision of peace, and contemplation of God, in eternal life.

<sup>2</sup> Because he hath strengthened the lockes of thy gates: he hath blessed thy children in thee.

<aside>In comparison of other cities, and peoples of the world, the gates of Ierusalem were strongly fensed, and the citizens blessed: much more the Church of Christ is built vpon a sure rock, her faithful children indued with al spiritual graces; and most of al, heauen it selfe is free from al danger of calamities, and the Sainctes are most secure & most happie, enioying eternal fruition of God.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Who hath set thy borders peace: and filleth thee with the fatte of corne.

<sup>4</sup> Who sendeth forth his speach to the earth: his word runneth swiftly.

[^1]

<sup>5</sup> Who geueth snow as wool: scattereth mist as ashes.

[^2]

<sup>6</sup> He casteth his crystal as morseles: before the face of his cold who shal endure?

[^3]

<sup>7</sup> He *m* shal sendforth his word, and shal melt them: *n* his spirit shal blowe, and *o* waters shal flowe.

[^4]

<sup>8</sup> Who declareth his word to *p* Iacob: his iustices, and iudgements to Israel.

[^5]

<sup>9</sup> He hath *q* not done in like maner to anie nation: and his iudgements he hath not made manifest to them. *r* Allelu-ia.

PSALME

[^1]: Hath geuen peace in thy borders, & and the very best corne, and al other fruictes: wine, oyle, milke, honey, and the rest. Allegorically in the Church, reconciliation with God, by remission of sinnes, and peace of conscience, in the Sacraments of Baptisme & Penance; with the most spiritual food of Christs Bodie and Bloud in the Eucharist, and graces of other Sacraments. In heauen most assured peace and ioy without end.

[^2]: This perteyneth most specially to Euangelical doctrine, preached & and quickely receiued in al the world Rom. 10. v. 18.

[^3]: Snow nourisheth the earth, making it warme by Antiperistasis, as is euident in natural Philosophie, & and moisture apte to change into other weather. In the Church by penance & austere life men are purged from sinnes and vices, enil spirites are also driuen away. If your sinnes shal be as scarlet, they shal be made as white as snow, and if they be redde as vermilion, they shal be white as wool, Isai. 1. v. 18.

[^4]: Yea some that are hardned in sinne, as yse, or chrystal, shal be melted, broken, or made fitte to be ingrafted in Gods Church. So S. Peter was admonished by a vision (Act. 10. v. 13.) to kil and eate. Otherwise without Gods grace geuing strength and force, no man can ouercome his owne vices.

[^5]: But Gods word preached, *n* and his grace touching mens hartes, *o* innumerable are conuerted.

[^6]: The Church only enioyeth these spiritual benefites.
