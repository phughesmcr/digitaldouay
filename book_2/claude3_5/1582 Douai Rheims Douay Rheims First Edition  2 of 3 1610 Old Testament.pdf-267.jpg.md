# THE THIRD PART
## OF THE OLD TESTAMENT,
### CONTEINING SAPIENTIAL
### BOOKES.

The argument of Sapiential Bookes.

Hitherto the Law, and Historie of Gods peculiar people are set forth in the former partes of the holie Bible: after which folowed the Booke of Psalmes, which in maner of stile, being al in verse, is a distinct part with the rest, but in substance of matter, is an Epitome or briefe Summe of al holie Scripture, and therfore commonly therfore placed in the middes of the rest, as the Sunne amongst other Planetes, a shining great light in a large spheare. Now ensueth this third part, conteining Diuine Instructions, or Rules of good life. A doctrine most agreable to God: high wisdom, and most fitly commended to Man, the reasonable creature in earth. But besides this principal subiect, as before is noted (that each part participateth with others in their proper contents) so here be manie preceptes of the Law renewed, sundrie examples of men, and thinges past repeted, and diuers prophecies vttered of thinges to come: though in this part more specially is shewed the ground, and as it were, the very life or soule of the Law, which is Reason, the true Rule or Directorie wherin al good lawes are grounded. For it both sheweth what ought to be done, or auoided, & directeth mans iudgement to embrace that is good, and to flee from al euil, not only illuminating the vnderstanding to see that is right and iust, but also disposing the internal affection to desire, loue, choose, and preferre the right path of Gods Law, before whatsoeuer otherwise semeth pleasant or profitable: & so notwithstanding al difficulties, perswadeth to perseuere to the end in holie conuersation. Al which by a general name is called Wisdom: comprising in one word, so called, al good desires, holie vertues, supernal giftes, godlie endeuoures, and the waies wherby God is rightly knowen, & duly serued; wherof these fiue Bookes, teaching this most excellent and most necessarie maner of life, are called Sapiential. Neuertheles some of them haue also other particular names, as appeareth in their titles. Only the fourth is called the Booke of Wisdom, by appropriation of the general name.
