<sup>28</sup>And let them hope in thee that know thy name: because thou hast not forsaken them that seeke thee ô Lord.

<sup>11</sup>Sing to our Lord, which dwelleth in Sion: declare his studies among the Gentiles:

<sup>12</sup>Because he m requiring bloud remembred them: he hath not forgotten the crie of the poore.

<sup>14</sup>Haue mercie on me ô Lord: See my humiliation n by my enemies:

<sup>15</sup>Which exaltest me from the gates of death, that I may declare al thy prayses in o the gates of the daughter of Sion.

<sup>16</sup>I wil reioyce in thy saluation: the Gentiles are p fastened in the destruction, which they made. In this snare, which they hid, is their foote taken.

<sup>17</sup>Our Lord shal be knowen doing iudgements: the sinner is taken in the workes of his owne handes.

<sup>18</sup>q Let sinners be turned into hel, al nations that forget God.

<sup>19</sup>Because to the end there shal not be obliuion of the poore man: the patience of the poore, shal not perish in the end.

<sup>20</sup>Arise Lord, let not man be strengthned: let the r Gentiles be iudged in thy sight.

<sup>21</sup>Appoint Lord s a lawgeuer ouer them: that the Gentiles may know that they be men.

<sup>1</sup>v Why Lord hast thou departed far of, despisest in opportunities, in tribulation?

<sup>2</sup>Whiles the impious is proude, the poore is w set on fyre: x they are caught in the counsels which they deuise.

<sup>3</sup>Because the sinner is praysed in the desires of his soule: and the vniust man is blessed.

[^5]: The wicked are intangled in the snares which they lay for others.

[^6]: In zele of iustice not in desire of reuenge.

[^7]: By Gentiles is often vnderstood al great sinners. For the Iewes despised Gentiles, as the Romans did al Barbarous nations.

[^8]: Suffer a tyrant to rule ouer them that thereby they may learne what it is to obey others vniustly. It seemeth to S. Augustine a prophecie, that such as receiue not Christ, shal belieue Antichrist.
