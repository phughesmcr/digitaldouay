<sup>11</sup> And he ascended upon the cherubs, and flew: he flew upon the wings of windes.

[^1] God most speedely, as flying with winges of mercie, comforteth & protecteth them.

<sup>12</sup> And he put darkenesse his couert, his tabernacle is round about him: darke some waters in the cloudes of the aire.

[^2] God being incomprehensible, is also secret in his determinations, and seuere in his proceedinges or actes.

<sup>13</sup> Because of the brightnesse in his sight the cloudes passed, haile and coles of fire.

<aside>Gods splendor oppressing this sense, yet signifieth, that Christ illuminateth the world by his Apostles, and other preachers denouncing his iustice, peace, and his wil in al thinges perteining to man.</aside>

<sup>14</sup> And our Lord thundered from heauen, and the Highest gaue his voice: haile and coles of fire.

<sup>15</sup> And he shot his arrowes, and dissipated them: he multiplied lightnings, and trubled them.

<sup>16</sup> And the fountaynes of waters appeared, and the fundations of the world were reueled.

At thy rebuke ô Lord, at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.

<sup>17</sup> He sent from on high, and tooke me: and he receiued me out of manie waters.

[^3] from tribulations.

<sup>18</sup> He deliuered me from my most strong enemies, and from them that hated me: because they were made strong ouer me.

[^4] Saul, Absolõ, Moabites, Ammonites, and al temporal and spiritual enemies.

<sup>19</sup> They preuented me in the day of mine affliction: and our Lord was made my protectour.

<aside>So in the rest of this Psalme the Prophet speaketh for most part in proper termes, without Metaphores or other figures. Yet in the mystical sense of Christ, and Christians.</aside>

<sup>20</sup> And he brought me out into largenesse: he saued me, because he would me.

[^5] Of his good pleasure without my desertes.

<sup>21</sup> And our Lord wil reward me according to my iustice, and according to the purity of my handes he wil reward me.

<sup>22</sup> Because I haue kept the waies of our Lord, neither haue I done impiously from my God.

<sup>23</sup> Because al his iudgementes are in my sight: and his iustices I haue not repelled from me.

<sup>24</sup> And I shal be immaculate with him: and shal keepe me from mine iniquitie.

<sup>25</sup> And our Lord wil reward me according to my iustice: and according to the puritie of my handes in the sight of his eies.

[^6] with the 21. verse, inculcating that God wil render to euerie one as they deserue.

<sup>26</sup> With the holie thou shalt be holie, and with the innocent man thou shalt be innocent.
