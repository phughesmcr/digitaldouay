OF PSALMES. 115

<sup>10</sup> But yet the children of men are vaine, the children of men are *m* liers in balances: that they may deceiue by vanitie together.

<aside>m *lying false weightes they deceaue one an other.*</aside>

<sup>11</sup> Hope not in iniquitie, and couete not robberies: if riches abound set not your hart vpon them.

<sup>12</sup> *n* Once hath God spoken, these *o* two things haue I heard: that power is Gods, and *p* mercie *b* to thee: because thou wilt render to euery one according to his workes.

<aside>n *God hath spoken it most assuredly.* o *Two special attributes of God.*</aside>

<aside>p *God is Omnipotent, so that he can both reward, and punish infinitly; q and Merciful, that he is readie to receiue al sinners into his fauour, if they wil repent and turne vnto him.*</aside>

PSALME. LXII.

*Dauid in banishment with great affection desireth to vnite himselfe with God in meditation, 4. purposing and promising euer to praise him: 10. prophecieth the vaine endeuoures, and condemnation of his enimies; and his owne aduancement.*

Dauids deuo-
tion in ba-
nishment.
the 8. key.

1 A Psalme *a* of Dauid when he was in the desert of Iuda: [^1]

*a Holie Dauid made this deuout meditation when he was in the forest of Hareth, or desert of Ziph 1. Reg. 22. & 23. and could not come to the tabernacle of God, nor to Ierusalem, where he especially desired to be, in the inheritance of our Lord, which was to him a great affliction. As the like is now to Catholiques, when they are in close prison for their faith, or otherwise hindered, that they can not be present at the most holie and daylie Sacrifice. In which case we must supplie as we may, this great losse, and comfort ourselues with this, or like Psalme, or prayer, saying: O God my God, to thee I watch.*

2 O GOD my God *b* to thee I watch, *c* from the morning light: *c* My soule hath thirsted to thee, *d* my flesh to thee very manie wayes.

[^2]

[^3]

[^4]

<sup>3</sup> In a desert land, and inaccessible, and without water: *e* so in the holie haue I appeared to thee, *f* that I might see thy strength, and thy glorie.

[^5]

<sup>4</sup> Because *g* thy mercie is better then liues, my lippes shal prayse thee.

[^6]

<sup>5</sup> So wil I blesse thee in my life: and in thy name I wil lifte vp my hands.

[^7]

As

[^1]: (1. Reg. 22.)

[^2]: b Euen from the first dawning of the morning, c my soule thirsteth after thee, d yea also my very flesh, and whole bodie feeleth great paines, by this affliction of mind, and desireth releefe and rest.

[^3]: c My soule hath thirsted to thee, d my flesh to thee

[^4]: b Euen from the first dawning of the morning,

[^5]: f Being now in exile that I can not see thee, O God, as I would, yet I exhibite myselfe present in spirite, before thy holie place, f meditating thy powre, and thy glorie.

[^6]: g This consolation in banishment from thy diuine Seruice, is sweeter to me then manie temporal liues, or anie worldlie prosperitie.

[^7]: h For as the Passions of Christ abound in vs (saith S. Paul 2. Cor. 1.) so also by Christ our comfort aboundeth.
