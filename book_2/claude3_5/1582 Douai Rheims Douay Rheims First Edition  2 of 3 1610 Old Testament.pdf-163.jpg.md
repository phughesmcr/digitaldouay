OF PSALMES 163

<sup>15</sup> Why doest thou o Lord reiect my prayer: turnest away thy face from me?

<sup>16</sup> I am poore, and in labours *n* from my youth: and being *o* exalted, humbled and troubled.

<aside>*As wel young, o as waxing elder I haue bene stil afflicted.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> Thy wrathes haue passed vpon me: and thy terrours haue trubled me.

<sup>18</sup> They haue compassed me as water al the day: they compassed me together.

<sup>19</sup> Thou p hast made frend, and neighbour far from me: and my familiars because of miserie.

<aside>p *My miserable estate hath alienated al freindes, neighboures, & acquaintances from me.*</aside>
