# THE BOOKE

## PSALME CXXIIII.

[^1] *The Church, and holie members thereof, are alwayes protected by God: 5. The wicked being suffered for a while, are at last punished.*

### A gradual Canticle.

<sup>1</sup> THEY *a* that trust in our Lord, as mount Sion: he shal not be moued for euer, *b* that dwelleth <sup>2</sup> in Ierusalem.

Mountains round about it: and our Lord round about his people, from hence forth now and for euer.

<sup>3</sup> Because our Lord *c* wil not leaue the rod of sinners vpon the lote of the iust: that the iust reach not their handes to iniquitie.

<sup>4</sup> Doe wel Ã´ Lord to the good, and right of hart.

<sup>5</sup> But *e* those that decline into obligations, our Lord wil bring with them that worke iniquitie: *f* peace vpon Israel.

[^2] Those that confidently trust in God, are in such securitie as is mount Sion, which is a hil, defended also with other hilles round about. *b* Another thing required to this securitie, is to dwel within Ierusalem, not the terrestrial citie, for (as S. Augustin obserueth) the Iewes that dwelt therin are destroyed or made captiues, and hitherto reiected of God, but in the Catholique Church.

[^3] God wil not alwayes, nor finally leaue the seruants of God in tribulation, but only a while for their good.

[^4] This prayer is also an asseueration, for it is certaine that God wil defend, and reward the good, and right of hart:

[^5] And no lesse assuredly God wil punish not only the notorious wicked, and principal authors of wickednes, but also al those that for feare or for commoditie, or for anie other cause, decline into obligations, bondes, couenants, or anie way consent, in external shew with the wicked against God: as in our sad profession of Heresie, or Schisme, though such temporizers do not thinke in their hart, that the pretended religion is true, wherto they are drawen to yeild external conformitie. For, as the Psalmist here teacheth, our Lord wil bring al such offenders, to the same iudgement and punishment, with the principal workers of iniquitie. / Al which being punished, then Ierusalem, the Catholique Church, shal haue peace.

## PSALME CXXV.

[^6] *Israelites released from captiuitie of Babylon, much more the blessed both of the old and new testament deliuered by Christ from captiuitie of sinne, do reioyce: 5. Who neuertheles must passe through tribulation to eternal felicitie.*

### A gradual Canticle.

<sup>1</sup> WHEN our Lord turned the captiuitie of Sion: we were made as *a* men comforted.

[^7] The Iewes released from captiuitie, were excedingly, and almost incredibly comforted, and thought it rather a dreame, then a truth that they were deliuered from miseries. So S. Peter when he was deliuered out of prison by an Angel, thought
