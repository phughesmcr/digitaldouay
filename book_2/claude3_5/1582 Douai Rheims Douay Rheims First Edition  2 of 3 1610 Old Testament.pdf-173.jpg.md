strength to reforme the world, and to inlarge his kingdom, according to his owne prediction where he saide: If I be exalted from the earth, I wil draw al thinges vnto myselfe. Ioan.12. v.32.

<sup>1</sup> For he hath established *h* the round world, which i shal not be moued.

<aside>h Not only in Iurie and Samaria, but the whole earth : i and the same Church shal not be destroyed.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> Thy seat is prepared from that time: thou *k* art from euerlasting.

<aside>k Christ being eternal, hath an euerlasting Church:</aside>

<sup>3</sup> The *l* riuers ô Lord haue lifted vp : the riuers haue lifted vp their voice.

<aside>l Al sortes of persecuters, the High priestes (who sometimes watered the spiritual land, like riuers) with Scribes, Pharises, and other incredulous Iewes, also Paganes, Turkes, and Heretikes haue oppugned the Church.</aside>

<sup>4</sup> The riuers haue lifted vp their waues, <sup>†</sup> m aboue the voices of manie waters.

<aside>m With more force then anie persecutions in the old Testament:</aside>

The surges of the sea are meruelous; *n* meruelous is our Lord on high.

<sup>5</sup> Thy testimonies are made *o* credible exceedingly : *p* holines becometh thy house ô Lord *q* for length of daies.

<aside>o Articles of faith are not euidently apparent to knowledge, but euident to credibilitie, to those that are disposed by Gods grace, illuminating their vnderstanding, and mouing their free wil, to geue consent of beleefe if they wil. p It becometh therefore al members of the Church to conuerse godly, and religiously in this life, seing she hath so excellent a spouse, protector, and instructor, q euen to the end of the world.</aside>

be glorified, and the wicked damned.

To a Dauid- himselfe, in *b* the fourth of the sabbath.

<aside>a The Hebrew letter Lamed, which ordinarily is prefixed to the datiue case, or signifieth to, being set before proper names, is a signe of the genitiue case. Yet the Septuagint, expresse it by the datiue, and so doth the latin, ipsi Dauid, and consequently our English hath, to Dauid himselfe, to shew a difference betwen sacred and profane writers. For in humane bookes the writer and auctor is al one; but in diuine, the Holie Ghost is the proper auctor, and a man is the writer.
