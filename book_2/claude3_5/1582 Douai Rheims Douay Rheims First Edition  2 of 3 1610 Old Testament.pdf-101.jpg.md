OF PSALMES. 101

sheding bloud, or other wrongs and iniuries: promising to praise Gods iustice, in offering and geuing peace, according to his promise to sinners, that they may repent.

<sup>17</sup> Lord, thou *b* wilt open my lippes: & my mouth shal shew forth thy prayse.

<aside>b Thou o God first stirring me vp, opening my lippes, which of my selfe I can not do, then my tongue and mouth wil praise thee.</aside>

<sup>18</sup> Because if thou *c* wouldest haue had sacrifice, I had verily giuen it: with holocaustes thou wilt *d* not be delighted.

<aside>c If thou wouldest haue corporall sacrifices, I would easily haue offered great store: d but the best of that kind is not sufficient:</aside>

<sup>19</sup> A *e* sacrifice to God is a afflicted spirit: a contrite, and humbled hart, ô God thou wilt not despise.

<aside>e true contrition of hart pleaseth thee farre better.</aside>

<sup>20</sup> Deale fauorably ô Lord in thy good wil *f* with Sion: that the walles of Ierusalem may be built vp.

<aside>f After a penitent hath remission of his owne sinnes, he must pray for the whole Church.</aside>

<sup>21</sup> Then shalt thou accept sacrifice of *g* iustice, *i* oblations, & *k* holocaustes: *l* then shal they lay calues vpon thyne altar.

<aside>g The Church prospering, her faithful children shal offer h the sacrifice of iustice, rendering to euerie one that is due; i also free offeringes without obligation, k yea holocaustes, which is the chiefest, l calues, and like hostes vpon the altar, according to the state of the old law: but in the law of Christ, the most B. Sacrifice by him instituted.</aside>

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. L.

1. *When Nathan came to Dauid.*] As Nathan denouncing to Dauid that our Lord had (vpon his repentance and confession) taken away his sinne, added punishment neuertheles that because he had made the enimies of God to blaspheme, his due after-remission should dye: so Dauid knowing that more was required then only confession, for that the bond of satisfaction remained after his sinnes were remitted, persisted in penance, praying, lamenting, and beseeching God according to his great and manifold mercies, to take away his iniquitie. Albeit the prophet Nathan had now told him, that our Lord had taken away his sinne, because there yet remained temporal paine due for the same. He prayeth also v. 4. that God wil, *wash him more amply, from his iniquitie, and cleanse him from his sinne.* For albeit the guilt of mortal sinne be washed and taken away, yet besides temporal punishment that is due, the soule that was so polluted, needeth to be more washed, and cleansed from the euil habite, or pronnes to fal againe, gotten by the former custome, or addiction in sinne.

7. *I was conceiued in iniquities.*] An other reason why sinners after remission of al mortal sinnes, neede to be washed and cleansed, is, because being borne remaineth still in original sinne, after remission therof, there remaineth concupiscence, that ter original striueth against vertue, and inclineth to sinne, from which we must pray, and sinne. labour to be more and more washed and cleansed.
