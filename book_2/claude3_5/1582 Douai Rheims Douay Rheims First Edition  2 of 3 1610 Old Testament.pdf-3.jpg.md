# PROEMIAL ANNOTATIONS
upon the Booke of Psalmes.

The authoritie of this Booke was euer authentical, and certaine, as the assured word of God, and Canonical Scripture. But concerning the author, there be diuers opinions. For although it be manifest by the testimonie of Philo, and Iosephus, that in their time, and alwaies before, only King Dauid was by al Hebrew Doctors holden for Author of al the Psalmes: yet after that learned Origen, and other Christian Doctors, expounded manie Psalmes of Christ, the Iewes being pressed therewith, begane to denie that al were Dauids: alleaging for their new opinion, the titles of diuers Psalmes, and some other difficulties, admitting occasion of much needles dispute, stil acknowledging the whole booke to be Canonical. Wherupon S. Ierom, and S. Augustin, sometimes admitted those as authores of certaine Psalmes, whose names are in the titles thereof. S. Cyprian, S. Cyril, S. Athanasius, and others agree in general, that Dauid writte not al: but differ much in particular, touching other supposed authores. In so much that *Melchisedech, Moyses, Asaph, Eman, Idithum, The sonnes of Core, Salomon, Ieremie, Ezechiel, Esdras, Aggæus, and Zacharias, are al (with more or lesse probabilitie) reputed authores of seueral Psalmes.* Neuertheles it semeth that S. Ierom rather related other mens iudgement, then shewed his owne; as we shal note by and by. And S. Augustin (*li. 17. c. 14. de ciuit*) maturely discussing this doubt, saith plainly, that *their iudgement semed to him more credible, who attribute al the hundred fiftie Psalmes to Dauid alone.* Further explicating that wheras some Psalmes haue Dauids owne name in their titles, some haue other mens names, some none at al, *this diuersitie importeth*

[^1]: This booke vndoubtedly is canonical Scripture.

[^2]: Late Hebrew Doctors and some Catholiques hold diuers authores of sundry Psalmes.

[^3]: *Præfat. in Psal. E-pist. 134. 139.*

[^4]: It is much more probable that Dauid was author of al.

[^5]: Proued by S. Augustin, S. Chrysostom, and greatest part of Doctors.
