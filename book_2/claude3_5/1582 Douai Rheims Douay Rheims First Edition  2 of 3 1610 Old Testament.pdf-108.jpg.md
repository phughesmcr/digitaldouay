In what day soever I shal invocate thee: loe I have knowne

PSALME. LVI.

*The Prophet prayeth in tribulation, 4. testifieth Gods helpe, 6. praiseth his
greatnes: 8. promising, and inviting al nations to praise him.*

<sup>1</sup> Vnto a the end, b destroy not, to David in c the inscription of
the title; d when he fled from the face of Saul into the cave.

[^4] The heroical facts of David are for examples to al Christians.

[^5] Innocent David having opportunitie to kil his vniust persecutor, obeyed the motion of God, suggesting vnto him, not to destroy his enemie; contrarie to the counsel of his freindes: a thing most worthie, to be recorded for perpetual memorie, & being in so great and vniust trouble, as to lye in the cave of a mountaine, yet spared to kil, or hurt him, that driue him into such straictes *See this historie 1. Reg. 24.*

<sup>2</sup> HAVE mercie on me Ã´ God, have mercie on me: because
my soule hath trusted in thee.

And I wil hope in the shadow of thy winges, vntil iniquitie
passe.

<sup>3</sup> I wil crie to God the highest : God that hath done me good.

<sup>4</sup> He sent e from heaven, and delivered me: he hath geven
into f reproche them that trede vpon me.

[^6] Extraordinarie, divine helpe, passing mans power. f It fel reprochfully to Saul, that David might have slain him, if he would, yet did neither hurt him, nor insult vpon him, but meekely and piously admonished him of his error, and iniurious persecution.

<sup>5</sup> God hath sent his mercie, and his truth, t and hath delivered
my g soule out of the middes of h Lions whelpes : I slept
trubled.

[^7] my life.

[^8] from most mightie and ravenous persecuters.

<sup>6</sup> The sonnes of men, their i teeth are weapons and arrowes:
and their k tongue a sharpe sword.

[^9] Though they have not lions natural teeth, yet they exercise crueltie by artificial weapons, and with their cruel tongues incite their folowers to the same furie. *1. Reg. 24. v. 10.*
