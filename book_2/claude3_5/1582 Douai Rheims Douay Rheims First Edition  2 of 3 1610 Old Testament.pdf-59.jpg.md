# OF PSALMES.

## ANNOTATIONS.

<aside>
1. In consumation of the tabernacle.] The seventie Interpreters testifie by adding this title, that king David made this Psalme (as he did also some others) when the Arke of God was brought into the tabernacle, which he had pitched for it in Sion. 1 *Reg. 6. 1. Paral. 16.* Wherin he saw by prophetical spirite, and here vttereth other future greater mysteries, & more excellent benefits, brought into the world by Christ, and preached by him, and his Apostles, then appered to the Arke, or the time of the old Testament; but are verified in the admirable fruite of innumerable people of al nations, and of manie great Potentates converted to Christianitie.

Bring to our Lord ye children of God: bring to our
Lord c the sonnes of rammes.

<sup>2</sup> Bring to our Lord d glorie and honour, bring to our Lord glorie vnto his name: adore ye our Lord e in his holie court.[^1]

<sup>3</sup> The voice of our Lord f vpon waters, the God of g maiestie hath h thundered: Our Lord vpon i manie waters.

<sup>4</sup> The voice of our Lord k in powre: the voice of our Lord in magnificence.

<sup>5</sup> The voice of our Lord m breaking ceders: and our Lord shal breake the n ceders of Libanus:

<sup>6</sup> And he shal breake them in peeces as a o calfe of Libanus. p and the beloued as q the sonne of vnicornes.

<sup>7</sup> The voice of our Lord r diuiding the flame of fire:

<sup>8</sup> The voice of our Lord f shaking the desert; and our Lord shal moue t the desert of Cades.

<sup>9</sup> The voice of our Lord u preparing x hartes, and he shal disco- uer thicke woodes: and in x in his temple al shal say glorie.

<sup>10</sup> Our Lord maketh y to inhabite the floud: and our Lord z shal sit king for euer.

Our Lord a wil geue strength to his people: our Lord b wil blesse his people in peace.

[^1]: b Offer sacrifice of thankes for the singular benefites after recounted in this Psalme. c Rammes were of the more principal thinges that were offe red in the law of Moyses. But the sonnes of rammes importe in mystical sense better hostes then rammes. d The first thing in sacrifice is to glorifie, honour, and adore God in sinceritie of spirite, e in his holie Catholique Church. f Here is a greater matter intimated then bare bringing of the Arke into a tabernacle prepared in Sion, when Dauid danced, and offered hostes for sacrifice, others hymning with him in that solemnitie. But this *voice of our Lord vpon waters* is rather verified of our Blessed Sauiours owne preaching with g maiestie, h thundering, & by his Apostles vpon i manie waters, manie nations: k in powre of miracles. l in magnificence preaching as hauing in dede powre, not as the Scribes and Pharisees. Mat. 7. v. 29. m breaking ceders among innumerable others, conuerting highest Potentates. n of Libanus, Emperours, kinges and greatest Princes of the world: o as a calfe of Libanus so meekly submitting them selues to Christes yoke, and spiritual obedience of his Church. p Al which is done by Christ our Lord the beloued of God, q as the sonne of vnicornes, is most tender yet beloued by his parentes. r This voice of our Lord diuiding the flame of fire, the Holie Ghost proceding from the Father and the Sonne, came vpon the Apostles, as in diuided tongues of fire. f wherewith the desert, the Gentiles of the wide and wild world
