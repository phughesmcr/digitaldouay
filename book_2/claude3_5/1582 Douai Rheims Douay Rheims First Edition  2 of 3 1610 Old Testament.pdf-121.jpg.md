# PSALME LXVI.

*The prophet prayeth for (and withal foresheweth) the propagation of the Church of Christ.*

<aside>Vnto the end, in hymes, a Psalme of Canticle to Dauid.</aside>

<aside>This Psalme beginning to be songue by voices, instruments were adioyned.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> God haue mercie vpon vs, and blesse vs: illuminate his countenance vpon vs, and haue mercie on vs.

<aside>God first remitte our sinnes: then geue vs thy manifold graces; grant faith and repentance, and so forgeue vs of sinnes.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> That we may know thy way vpon earth: in al nations thy saluation.

<sup>3</sup> Let peoples ô God, confesse to thee: let al peoples confesse to thee.[^1]

<sup>4</sup> Let nations be glad & reioice: because thou iudgest peoples in equitie, and the nations in earth thou doest direct.

<sup>5</sup> Let peoples ô God confesse to thee, let al peoples confesse to thee: <sup>6</sup> the earth hath yelded her fruite.

<sup>7</sup> God, our God blesse vs, God blesse vs: and let al the endes of the earth feare him.

<aside>God the Fater, God the Sonne, God the Holie Ghost, saue the peoples of al nations, by Euangelical preaching of thee, the most Blessed Trinitie.</aside>

# PSALME LXVII.

*Notwithstanding great persecution, the Church stil prospereth. Especially in the new testament, by Apostolical sanction, the ministerie of Angels, Christs Ascension, coming of the Holie Ghost, 31. confirming the faithful, repressing the insolent, and conuerting manie. 35. For al which the prophet inuiteth al men to praise God.*

<aside>The Church stil conserued. The 6. key.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> Vnto the end, a Psalme of Canticle, to Dauid himself.

<sup>2</sup> Let God arise, and let his enimies be dispersed, and let them that hate him flee from his face.

<aside>In maner of praying that God wil vouchsafe to defend the Church, the Psalmist prophecieth that God wil arise, and the enimies shal flee away, not daring to abide the combate.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> As smoke vanisheth, let them vanish away: as waxe melteth at the presence of fire, so let sinners perish at the presence of God.

<sup>4</sup> And let the iust make merrie, and reioyce in the sight of God: and let them be delighted in mirth.

<aside>As God is terrible to the wicked: so he is comfortable to the iust.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Sing

[^1]: *Al nations shal be conuerted.*
