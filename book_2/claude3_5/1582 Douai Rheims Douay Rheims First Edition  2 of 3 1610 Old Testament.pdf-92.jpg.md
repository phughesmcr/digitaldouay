<sup>7</sup> Nations are trubled, and kingdomes are inclined: he gaue his voice, the earth was moued

[^1]: Sometimes one nation or kingdome rebelleth against the Church, but can not destroy it. by the spirite of Christ, Antichrist, and al his members shal be destroyed.

<sup>8</sup> The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iacob is our defender.

<sup>9</sup> Come ye, and see the workes of our Lord, what wonders he hath put vpon the earth: <sup>10</sup> taking away warres euen vnto the end of the earth.

[^2]: The Church sometimes hath great peace, and tranquillitie.

He shal destroy bow, & breake weapons: and shields he shal burne with fire.

<sup>11</sup> Be quiet, and see that I am God: I shal be exalted among the gentiles, and I shal be exalted in the earth.

[^3]: God himselfe represseth the wicked, suddenly abating their furie, or cutting of their forces.

<sup>12</sup> The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iacob is our defender.

<sup>2</sup> AL ye Nations b clappe handes: make iubilation to God in the voyce of exultation.

[^5]: True ioy of the hart sheweth it selfe bothe in voice of exultation, and also in gesture of body, by clapping of handes, dauncing (as king Dauid did before the Arke. 2. Reg. 6.) likewise with instruments.

[^6]: To al the wicked, & not only of one or few kingdomes, but of al the earth.

[^7]: When kinges, and countries become Christians, they are made subiectes to the Church that was before, not heades and rulers therof.

<sup>5</sup> He hath chosen his inheritance in vs: the beautie of Iacob which he loued.

<sup>6</sup> f God is ascended in g iubilation: and our Lord in the voice of trumpet.

[^8]: Christ God & man, after his Passion, rose from death and ascended: g not leauing his Church desolate, but making her ioyful by an other comforter the Holie Ghost.
