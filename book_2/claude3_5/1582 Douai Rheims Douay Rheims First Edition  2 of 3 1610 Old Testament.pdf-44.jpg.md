## PSALME XIX.

*Faithful people ioyne their prayer, for their Prince or Prelate, with sacriÂ­fice offered for his preseruation, and prosperous successe.*

[^1] <sup>1</sup>Vnto a the end, the Psalme of Dauid.

[^2] <sup>2</sup>OVr Lord heare b thee in the day of tribulation: the name of the God of Iacob protect thee.

<sup>3</sup>Send he ayde to thee from the holie place: and from Sion defend he thee.

<sup>4</sup>Be he mindeful of al thy c sacrifice: and be thy holocaust made d fatte.

<sup>5</sup>Geue he vnto thee according to thy hart: and confirme he al thy counsel.

<sup>6</sup>We shal reioyce e in thy saluation: and in the name of our God we shal be magnified.

<sup>7</sup>Our Lord accomplish al thy petitions: now haue I knowen f that our Lord hath saued *his* CHRIST.

He shal heare him from his holie heauen: the saluation of his righthand is, g in powers.

<sup>8</sup>These in chariotes, and these in horses: but we wil inuocate in the name of the Lord our God.

<sup>9</sup>i They are bound, and haue fallen: but we haue risen and are set vpright.

<sup>10</sup>Lord k saue the king, and heare vs in the day, that we shal inuocate thee.

[^1]: Though such a prayer was very fitly made for Dauid Ezechias, or other kinges of Iuda, yet it is more properly serueth for Christian kinges and Prelates.

[^2]: The king, or other superior praying for him selfe, his subiects pray with him, and for him. It may also be applied to Christ, praying whiles he was mortal, or now praying for his mystical body the Church, but in both these cases, our prayers are only necessary for his seruantes not for him.

[^3]: The Hebrew word MINCHA signifieth sacrifice of floure, and vnbloudy, so pertaineth to the Eucharist, in forme of bread, and vvine. A acceptable for him, for vvhom it is offered.

[^4]: *in the prosperous state of thee our superiour.*

[^5]: his anointed king, or Priest. Mystically faithful people acknowlege the victory of Christ our Sauiour ouer death and al enemies.

[^6]: *in great strength, or heauenlie forces.*

[^7]: *men trusting in humane and worldly powre fal into captiuitie.*

[^8]: *By preseruation of the head the body is also conserued.*
