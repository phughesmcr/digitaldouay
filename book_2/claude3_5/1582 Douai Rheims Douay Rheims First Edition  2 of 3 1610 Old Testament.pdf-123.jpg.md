OF PSALMES. 123

<sup>15</sup> Whiles *x* the heauenlie discerneth kings ouer her, *y* with snow they shal be made white in Selmon.

<aside>x When the heauenlie king discerneth thus of earthlie kinges, y they shal be purged from their sinnes, and made white like snow, that falleth in mount Selmon, which is a shadowed hil, thicke with trees, in mount Ephraim nere to Iordan.</aside>

<sup>16</sup> The *z* mountane of God a fat mountane.

<aside>z The Church of God is visible, and durable like to a mountane.</aside>

<sup>17</sup> A mountane *a* crudded as cheese, a *b* fatte mountane: <sup>"why</sup> *c* suppose you crudded mountanes?

<aside>a Combined, or ioyned together, as when milke is turned into curde, and so into cheese. b fruitful, enriched by spiritual giftes of the Holie Ghost. c ye that are not of this Church, do in vaine and erroniouslie imagine, that other mountaines are vnited.</aside>

A mountane, in which it hath wel pleased God to dwel therein: for in dede our Lord wil dwel euen to the end.

<sup>18</sup> The *d* chariote of God is ten thousand folde, thousands of them that reioyce, our Lord in them, *e* in Sina in the holie place.

<aside>d Innumerable Angels ministers of Gods wil, do continually attend vpon his Divine Maiestie, as if he (who otherwise nedeth no seruice) were caried by them, as in a chariotte of infinite magnificence. Dan 7. e So God appeared in Maiestie, when he gaue his law in mount Sinai.</aside>

<sup>19</sup> Thou art *f* ascended on high, thou *g* hast taken captiuitie: thou *h* hast receiued giftes in men: for euen those *i* that do not belieue, our Lord God to inhabite.[^1]

<sup>20</sup> Blessed be our Lord day by day: the God of our saluations wil make vs a prosperous iourney.

<sup>21</sup> Our God is the God of sauing: and *k* the issues of death are of our Lord, our Lord.

<aside>k Our Lord, I say, our Lord, and none but he could ouercome death by dying.</aside>

<sup>22</sup> But yet God *l* stil breake the heads of his enemies: the hearie crowne of them, that walke in their sinnes.

<aside>l Though Christ died to deliuer al men from death, yet he wil geue capital sentence of eternal death to al that obstinately remaine his enemies, and multiplie sinnes vpon sinnes, to the end of their temporal life.</aside>

<sup>23</sup> Our Lord Said: Out *m* of Basan I wil conuert, I wil conuert *n* into the depth of the sea.

<aside>m Euen of the rudest barbarous nations, manie shal be conuerted to Christianitie n namely Gods grace is extended into the Ilandes of the Ocean, and other seas.</aside>

<sup>24</sup> That thy foote *o* may be dipped in bloude: the tongue of thy dogges [*made redde*] with *p* the same [*bloud*] of the enimies.

<aside>o But such seuere slaughter shal fal vpon the obstinate contemners of his grace, that mens feete shal be defiled in their bloud, and dogges shal lappe it.</aside>

[^1]: Christ ascended with innumerable Angels attending vpon him, g caried with him the fathers of the old testament, that had bene captiues, h as man he receiued giftes of God, in and for men, his faithful seruantes, i yea also he receiued for his merite, that innumerable, which before were incredulous, were conuerted, and God dwelt in their soules.
