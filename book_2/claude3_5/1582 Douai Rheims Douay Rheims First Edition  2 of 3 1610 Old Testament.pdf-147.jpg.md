<sup>53</sup>And he brought them forth in hope, and they feared not: and the sea covered their enemies.

<sup>54</sup>And he brought them into the mount of his sanctification, the mount, which his right hand purchased.

<aside>Iudea a hillie countrie. Into that countrie which God chose, and endowed with manie blessinges.</aside>

And he cast f out the gentiles from their face: and by lot he f divided the land of them in a corde of distribution:[^1]

<sup>55</sup>And he made the tribes of Israel to dwel in their tabernacles.

<sup>56</sup>And g they tempted, and exasperated God the highest, and they kept not his testimonies.

<sup>57</sup>And they turned away themselves, & kept not the covenant: as their fathers, they were turned as a h crooked bow.

<sup>58</sup>They incensed him to wrath in their i hilles: and in their grauens they provoked him k to emulation.

<sup>59</sup>God heard, and contemned: and he brought Israel to nothing l excedingly.

<aside>Not absolutely to nothing, but punished them excedingly, til they repented, and then spared and delivered them from tribulation, as appeareth in the booke of Iudges.</aside>

<sup>61</sup>And he delivered o their force into captivitie: and their beautie into the hands of the enemie.

<aside>For their sinnes God suffered the Arke to be taken.</aside>

<sup>62</sup>And he p shut vp his people in the sword: and he dispised his inheritance.

<aside>And the Israelites to be sore afflicted by their enimies.</aside>

<sup>63</sup>Fyre devoured their young men: and their virgins were not lamented.

<aside>The zelous wrath of God suffered these calamities to happen.</aside>

<sup>64</sup>Their r Priestes fel by the sworde: and their widowes were not wept for.

<aside>Ophni and Phinees the sonnes of Heli slaine and Heli himselfe hearing that the Arke was taken fel from his stoole and broke his neck. 1 Reg. 4.</aside>
