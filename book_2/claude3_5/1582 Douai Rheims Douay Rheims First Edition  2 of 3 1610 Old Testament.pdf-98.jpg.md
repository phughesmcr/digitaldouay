THE BOOKE

<sup>14</sup> Immolate to God "the sacrifice of praise, and *n* pay thy vowes to the Highest.

[^1] *m* Spiritual sacrifice of prayse. *n* & due payment of voluntarie vowes made in honour of God,

<sup>15</sup> And *p* invocate me in the day of tribulation: I wil deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.

[^2] *O* and praying to him for helpe in tribulation are most grateful.

<sup>16</sup> But to the sinner God hath sayde: *p* Why doest thou declare my iustices, and takest my testament by thy mouth?

[^3] *p* He that wil teach others, must especially flee from sinne, & feare God sincerely.

<sup>17</sup> But thou hast hated discipline: & cast my words behind thee.

<sup>18</sup> If thou didst see a theefe, thou didst runne with him: and with adulterers thou didst put thy portion.

<sup>19</sup> Thy mouth hath abounded with malice: and thy tongue fourged guiles.

<sup>20</sup> Sitting thou spakest against thy brother, and against thy mothers sonne thou didst put a scandal:

<sup>21</sup> these things hast thou done, and I haue held my peace.

<sup>22</sup> Thou hast thought vniustly that I wil be like thee: I wil reproue thee, and set it against thy face.

<sup>23</sup> Vnderstand these things you that forget God: lest sometime he take you violently and there be none to deliuer you.

<sup>24</sup> The " sacrifice of prayse *q* shal glorifie me: and there is the way, by which I wil shew him the saluation of God.

[^4] *q* God is honored by mans gratitude, and other good workes.

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XLIX.

[^5] Sacrifice of praise disposeth men to the fruit of eternal sacrifice.

14. 15. *The sacrifice of praise*.) For better and more due performing of external sacrifice, it is requisite, that those which offer it, offer also to God inward vertues, or dispositions: as sorrow and repentance for their sinnes, which is a kinde of improper sacrifice (mentioned in the next Psalme) the sacrifice of iustice, which tendeth to cuerie one that is due (Psal. 4.) and sacrifice of praise, or thankes geuing, for al Gods benefites receiued or expected, which kindes of internal and improper sacrifices, being premised, and rightly prepare men to the fruite of external sacrifice, prescribed in the law of nature, the law of Moyses, and of Christ. It is place also hath an other higher and prophetical sense of the Sacrifice of Christs bodie in the Eucharist, which is both propitiatorie, and Sacrifice of praise and thankes geuing. So S. Augustin (orat. aduersus Iud√¶os. c. 6.) teacheth, that here certainly is a plaine change of the old sacrifices. The same he affirmeth Ep. 120. c. 18. God foreshewing that the old sacrifices should be changed, which were offered in shadow of a sacrifice to come. I wil not (saith God to Israel) receiue nor accepte thy hand, &c. but appoynteth that al Israel (al nations from the rysing of the sunne to the setting) shal immolate the sacrifice of praise, the same Christ, whom old Simeon knew an infant, whom he receiued into his handes. Likewise li. contra aduerf. legis & prophet. c. 20. The Church offereth to God in the bodie of Christ the sacrifice of praise.

[^6] The Sacrifice of the Eucharist prophetical.
