OF PSALMES. 175

<sup>14</sup>Because our Lord *b* wil not reiect his people: and his inheritance he wil not forsake.

<aside>*h* The whole Church shal neuer be reiected, nor forsaken.</aside>

<sup>15</sup>Vntil iustice i be turned into iudgement: and *k* they who are neere it, are al that are right of hart.

<aside>*i* Iustice is conuerted into iudgement, when iust meanes is putin worke and practise, that it may appeare in iudgement. Also God who doth & suffereth al iustly, wil conserue his inheritance the Church, euen vnto the day of iudgement. *k* The sense is easie by transposing the wordes: al that are right of hart, are neere it, that is, shal like and approue Gods iustice, when the wicked shal repine, and blaspheme it.</aside>

<sup>16</sup>Who shal rise for me against the malignant? or who shal stand with me against them that worke iniquitie?

<sup>17</sup>But that our Lord hath holpen me: within very litle my soule had dwelt in hel.

<sup>18</sup>If I said: *l* My foote is moued: thy mercie Ã´ Lord did help me

<aside>*l* When I fele, and complained that I was in danger, thou didst assist me.</aside>

<sup>19</sup>According to the multitude of my sorrowes in my hart: thy consolations haue made my soule ioyful.

<sup>20</sup>Doth the seat of iniquitie cleaue to thee: which makest *m* labour in precept?

<aside>*m* Onlie faith sufficeth not, but careful laboure, in keping Gods commandments is required.</aside>

<sup>21</sup>They wil hunt after the soule of the iust: and wil condemne innocent bloud.

<sup>22</sup>And our Lord became my refuge: and my God the helpe *n* of my hope.

<aside>*n* The iust do hope for eternal saluation, to which God wil bring them.</aside>

<sup>23</sup>And he *o* wil repay them their iniquitie: and in their malice he wil destroy them: the Lord our God wil destroy them.

<aside>*o* And God, the reuenger of wronges, wil at last cast the wicked into eternal torments.</aside>

PSALME. XCIIII.

*An inuitation to serue and adore Christ our Lord and Messias, 3. aswell for the benefites of creation of thinges, 7. as for his Incarnation, and not to harden our hartes as the Iewes did.*

Praise *a* of Canticle, *b* to Dauid him selfe.

<aside>*a* Praise (some write praise) *b* inspired to Dauid, or written by him.</aside>

<sup>1</sup>COME, let vs reioyce to our Lord: let vs make iubilation to God our sauiour.

<sup>2</sup>*c* With great and solemne exultation: *d* God our Creator, is also our Protector & Sauiour.
