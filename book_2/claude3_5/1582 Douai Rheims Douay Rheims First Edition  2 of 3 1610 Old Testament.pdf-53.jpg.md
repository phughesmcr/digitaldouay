OF PSALMES.

<sup>2</sup>TO thee O Lord I haue lifted vp my soule: my God in thee is my confidence, let me not be ashamed:[^1]

<sup>3</sup>Neither let mine enemies scorne me: for al that expect thee, shal not be confounded.[^2]

<sup>4</sup>Let al be confounded that do vniust thinges in vayne. Lord shew me thy wayes: and teach me thy pathes.[^3]

<sup>5</sup>Direct me in thy truth, and teach me: because thou art God my Sauiour, and thee haue I expected al the day.[^4]

<sup>6</sup>Remember O Lord thy commiserations, and thy mercies: that are from the beginning of the world.

<sup>7</sup>The sinnes of my youth, and my ignorances doe not remember.[^5]

According to thy mercie remember thou me: for thy goodnesse O Lord.

<sup>8</sup>Our Lord is sweete, and righteous: for this cause he wil geue a law to them that sinne in the way.[^6]

<sup>9</sup>He wil direct the milde in iudgement: he wil teach the meeke his wayes.

<sup>10</sup>Al the wayes of our Lord, be mercie and truth, to them that seeke after his testament and his testimonies.[^7]

<sup>11</sup>For thy name O Lord thou wilt be propitious to my sinne: for it is much.[^8]

<sup>12</sup>Who is the man that feareth our Lord: he appointeth him a law in the way, that he hath chosen.[^9]

<sup>13</sup>His soule shal abide in good things: and his seede shal inherite the land.[^10]

<sup>14</sup>Our Lord is a firmament to them that feare him: & his testament that it may be made manifest to them.[^11]
