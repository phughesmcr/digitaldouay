ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. CXIII.

11. *The idoles of the Gentiles are siluer and gold.*] Al Catholique Diuines agree in this authentical definition, of Idolatrie, that it is diuine honour geuen to anie creature, as to a god. Of the diuers fortes also of Idolatrie the ancient learned Latin Doctors haue written much. Namely Iustinus Martyr in his Orations against the Gentiles, Tertullian in Apologetico, Arnobius Orat. ad Gentes. Lactantius, li. 1. c. 17. Diuinar. Instit. and manie others. But most copiously and profoundly S. Augustin, especially in his great sift booke de Ciuitate Dei. Into which er- ror crimes the Platonistes fel, holding that spiritual inuisible creatures subsist- ed, to witte, Angels good and eu l, whom they called Intelligentias separa- tas, had diuine power, & so gaue to them diuine honour. Others honour dead Men liuing or men, and some before their death as goddes, for their notable actes atchieued dead. in this life, as Saturne, Iuppiter, Hercules, and the like. Some yeld diuine ho- nour to mere corporal creatures, liuing or without life, as to beastes and ser- pentes, the sunne, the moone, fire, water, earth, the whole machine of the world, as if it were animate, and that with diuine spirite or soule. Againe al these haue bene worshipped as gods, not only in them selues but also in their images. But to omitte other diuersities, the most grosse sorte of al, is the Ido- latrie which the Psalmist here describeth, when images made by mens handes are immediatly honored as goddes in themselues. For such goddes the Gen- tiles had, and of them the Prophet here speaketh. Comparing these visible senslesse imagined goddes, with the one eternal inuisible God; who is made notorious by his diuine conspicuous workes; whereas these idols, by how much they are more visible, so much more they are contemptible: because be- ing fashioned with mouth, eyes, eares, nose, handes, feete, throte, and other members, they are altogether fruitlesse, not able to speake with their mouth, and therfore more base in nature, then the men that made them: not able to see, heare, smel, tast, feele, to walke, to moue, nor to crie, al which beastes can doe. And therfore in the last make them, or haue confidence in them (as the Prophet here signifieth that some haue. v. 16.) are most absurde: becoming like to the same idols, in their vnderstanding and internal cogitations, as these idols are voide of external sense. And al Idolaters are most wretched, geuing diuine honour to anie creature, & are therin seruantes of diuels: Whether they immediatly honour diuels, as when forcerers & witches, making pact with And seruants the diuel, adore him, and he for the same doth something which they demand: of diuels. or that they honour some other creature, wherin by the diuels false perswa- sion, they thinke there is diuine power. Both which waies diuels vsurpe Gods honour and therfore the same Prophet saide in an other Psalme: Al the goddes of Gentiles are diuels.
