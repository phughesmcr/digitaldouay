THE BOOKE

<sup>2</sup> Let vs preuent his face in confession: and in Psalmes let vs make iubilation to him.

[^1] Let vs be more diligent, and preuent our accustomed time. For no man can preuent Gods grace with anie good worke, who first preueneth vs, as we can neither doe, nor thinke anie good thing, not only in singing his praise with voice, but also with musical instruments.

<sup>3</sup> Because our Lord is a great God: and a great King aboue al goddes.

<sup>4</sup> Because in his hand are the endes of the earth: and the heightes of the mountaines be his.

<sup>5</sup> Because the sea is his, and he made it: and his handes formed the drie land.

<sup>6</sup> Come let vs adore, and fal downe: and wepe before our Lord, that made vs.

[^2] So also Isaias (c. 45. v. 23.) and S. Paul (Philip. 2.) teach that kneeling or bowing the knees, as an external religious ceremonie, is acceptable to God.

<sup>7</sup> Because he is the Lord / our God, and we the people of his pasture, and the shepe / of his hand.

[^3] It is most iust and necessarie that we adore God, because he made vs, and al this world for vs, hath also redemed vs, and made vs his people, as shepe of his pasture, and as a Pastor feedeth and gouerneth vs.

<sup>9</sup> To day if ye shal heare his voice, " harden not your hartes;

[^4] Though some haue often repelled, and resisted Gods grace, yet if they receiue it being offered againe, it wil auaile to remission of sinnes.

<sup>9</sup> As in the prouocation according to the day / of the tentation in the desert: where your fathers tempted me, proued me, " and saw my workes.

[^5] The Israelites in the desert tempted God, by desiring water, and flesh, of voluptuous concupiscence without necessitie. For Manna did both extinguish their thirst, and tasted vnto them, whatsoeuer they desired. Exo. 16. That also which was left vngathered when the sunne waxed hotte, melted (v. 21.) and serued their cattel for drinke. So this tentation was a figure of those, which require to communicate vnder both kindes: as if one did not conteine as much as both.

<sup>10</sup> Fourtie years was I offended with that generation, and said: These alwaies erre in hart.

[^6] By this mention of the offence of fourtie yeares, as long before passed, is conuinced that Moyses wrote this Psalme, who died in the very fourtith yeare of their abode in the desert. And S. Paul citing the wordes of this Psalme (Heb. 4.) manifestly acknowledgeth Dauid the writter therof, and that it was written long after Moyses time in these wordes: (v. 7.) Againe he limiteth a certaine day, To day, in Dauid saying: after so long time, it is aboue said. To day if you shal heare his voice, do not obdurate your hartes. For if Iesus (that is Iosue) had geuen them rest, he would neuer speake of an other day afterward.

<sup>11</sup> And these haue not knowne my waies: as I sware in my wrath: if they shal enter into my rest.

<aside>Those that murmured died in the desert, and entered not into the promised land, euen so those that finally offend Christ, shal not enter into euerlasting rest: Heb. 3. & 4.</aside>
