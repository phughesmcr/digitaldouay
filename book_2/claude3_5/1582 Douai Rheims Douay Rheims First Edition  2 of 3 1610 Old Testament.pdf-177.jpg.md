ANNOTATIONS. PSALME. XCIII.

<aside>8. Harden not your hartes.] Whatsoever God proposeth by preaching, or inspiration to a sinner, it resteth stil in the powre of his freewil, to harden his harte, and to resist al such good motions, and so he doth not only frustrate resist good Gods grace, and hinder his owne iustification, but also increaseth his former sinnes. But by not resisting, when deliberating therupon he could resist, he disposeth himselfe and cooperateth to first iustification. And therfore the royal Prophet here admonisheth, and earnestly exhorteth al men, to do this which God hath put in our powre, not to harden our owne hartes, when we heare his voice, by resisting and reiecting his grace freely ofered, without al merite of our part.</aside>

PSALME. XCV.

*Al peoples & nations are inuited to praise the blessed Trinitie, 3. for Christs Incarnation, and spiritual kingdom in al the world: 10. euen sensles creatures acknowledging his maiestie, 13. and iudicial powre.*

<aside>Par. v. 23.</aside>

1 A Canticle a to Dauid * himselfe, b when the house was built after the captiuitie.

<aside>a Inspired to Dauid, and written by him : b prophecying the restauration of the temple, after the future captiuitie. And that in figure of the vniuersal redemption of mankind by Christ, from the captiuitie of the diuel.</aside>

<aside>c For a new benefite, farre greater then the deliuerie of Israel from Ægypt.</aside>

2 <sup>†</sup> Sing ye to our Lord, and blesse his name: shew forth his saluation from day to day.

<aside>d The same wordes [Sing to our Lord] thrise repeted, signifie the Blessed Trinitie, as some Fathers note. Likewise v. 7. and 8. Bring ye to our Lord, &c. in both places concluding in the singular number, blesse his name, bring to his name, importing one God.</aside>

3 <sup>†</sup> Shew forth his glorie among the Gentiles, his meruelous workes in al peoples.

4 <sup>†</sup> Because our Lord is great, and exceeding laudable: he is terrible aboue al goddes.

5 <sup>†</sup> Because al the goddes of the Gentiles are e diuels, but our Lord f made the heauens.

<aside>e What creatures soeuer (spiritual or corporal, visible or inuisible the paganes serue for goddes, stil they be diuels that deceiue them, and diuers wayes vsurpe diuine honour, making such idolaters to thinke, that there is diuine powre, where none is. f He only is true God, who is Creator of heauen, and of al creatures. For no creature can create anie thing at al, that is, make anie thing of nothing but only God.</aside>

6 <sup>†</sup> Confession, and beautie in his sight: holinesse, and magnificence in his sanctification.

† Bring
