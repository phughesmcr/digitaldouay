OF PSALMES.                                                75

That they may deceive the poore and needie: that they may
murder the right of hart.

<sup>15</sup> Let their owne swordes enter into their hartes: and let
their bowe be broken.

<aside>i By way of imprecation (as in manie other places) the prophet foresheweth that wicked
men shal fal into the evils, which they prepare for others.</aside>

<sup>16</sup> Better is a litle to the iust, above much riches of sinners.

<sup>17</sup> Because the armes of sinners shal be broken in pieces: but
our Lord confirmeth the iust.

<sup>18</sup> Our Lord knoweth the daies of the immaculate: and their
inheritance shal be for ever.

<sup>19</sup> They shal not be confounded in the evil time, and in the
<sup>20</sup> dayes of famine they shal be filled: because the sinners shal
perish.

But the enemies of our Lord forthwith as they shal be honoured and exalted, vanishing shal vanish as smoke.

<sup>21</sup> The sinner shal borrow, and not pay: but the iust is merciful and wil geue.

<sup>22</sup> Because they that blesse him shal inherite the land: but they
that curse him shal perish.

<sup>23</sup> With our Lord the steppes of man shal be directed: and he
shal like wel of his way.

<sup>24</sup> When he shal fal, he shal not be brused: because our Lord
putteth his hand vnder.

<aside>k Though the iust fal of frailtie or ignorance into venial sinne, yet Gods grace shal stay
him that he fal not into mortal. The iust falleth seven times in the day, & riseth. Prov. 24.</aside>

<sup>25</sup> I haue bene yong, for I am old: and I haue not sene the iust
forsaken, nor his seede seeking bread.[^1]

<sup>26</sup> Al the day he is merciful and lendeth: and his seede shal be
in blessing.

[^1]: So king David observed: and it very rarely happeneth, that the iust or their children are destitute of necessarie sustenance in this world. If it chance in some, it is to their greater merite, and is manifestly recompensed in spiritual giftes. In which sense S. Basil expoundeth, that it is alwayes verified. For God ever rewardeth good workes either temporally, or spiritually, or both wayes. S. Augustine (li. 1. cont. 2. in hunc Psal.) exemplifieth in Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob with al his familie, who were forced to goe into other countries by reason of famine: and by Gods providence were there ful saved. Gen. 12. & 26. & 42. S. Paul among his other tribulations mentioneth famine and thirst. 2. Cor. 11. v. 27. Seing therfore these so iust persons sought their bread in necessitie, he expoundeth this holie Scripture in the Allegorical sense, that the Church from her beginning in Ierusalem to the end of the world, never wanteth the true word of God, true faith and doctrin, which is the spiritual bread wherewith the soule is nourished.
