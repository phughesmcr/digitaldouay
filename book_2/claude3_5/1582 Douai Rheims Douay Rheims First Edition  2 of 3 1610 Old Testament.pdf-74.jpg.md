# THE BOOKE

This Psalme is composed in order of the Alphabet, euerie distick beginning with a diuers letter, to moue the reader to diligent attention, which may serue in place of a larger commentarie.

## A Psalme <sup>1</sup> to Dauid him self.

[^a] HAVE <sup>1</sup> no emulation toward the malignant: neither enuie them that doe iniquitie.

[^b] Because <sup>2</sup> they shal quickly wither as grasse: and as the blossomes of herbes they shal soone fal.

[^c] <sup>3</sup> Hope in our Lord and doe good: and inhabite the land, and thou <sup>e</sup> shalt be fed in the riches therof.

<sup>4</sup> Be delighted in our Lord: and he wil geue thee the petitions of thy hart.

<sup>5</sup> Reuele thy way to our Lord, and hope in him: and he wil doe it.

<sup>6</sup> And he wil <sup>g</sup> bring forth thy iustice as light: and thy iudgement as midday: <sup>7</sup> be subiect to our Lord, and pray him.

Haue no emulation in him, that prospereth in his way: in a man that doth iniustices.

<sup>8</sup> Cease from wrath, and leaue furie: haue not emulation that thou be malignant.

<sup>9</sup> Because they that are malignant, shal be cast out: but they that expect our Lord, the same shal inherite <sup>h</sup> the land.

<sup>10</sup> And yet a litle while, and the sinner shal not be: and thou shalt seeke his place, and shalt not find it.

<sup>11</sup> But the meeke shal inherite the land, and shal be delighted in multitude of peace.

<sup>12</sup> The sinner shal obserue the iust: and shal gnash vpon him with his teeth.

<sup>13</sup> But our Lord shal scorne him: because he foreseeth that his day shal come.

<sup>14</sup> Sinners haue drawen out the sword; they haue bent their bowe;

That

[^a] For Dauids and euery iust mans instruction.

[^b] Neither be thou offended that the wicked do prosper in this world, nor imitate them that thou maist also prosper.

[^c] For al this life, and consequently the prosperitie therof is shorte, and vncertaine.

[^d] Put thy trust in God, liuing content in this world: & he wil geue thee that is necessarie.

[^f] Commend al thyne affaires to God.

[^g] Partly making vertue appeare to the comfort of the vertuous, and example of others in this life, but especially in the next world.

[^h] the land of the liuing.
