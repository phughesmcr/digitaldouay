<sup>6</sup>They seeing it so, were in admiration, were trubled, were
moued: <sup>7</sup>trembling tooke them.
<sup>8</sup>Their sorowes as a woman traueling, In a vehement spi-
rit thou shalt breake the shippes of Tharsis.

[^1]

<sup>9</sup>As we haue heard, so haue we seene in the citie of the Lord
of hostes, in the citie of our God: God hath founded it for euer.

[^2]

<sup>10</sup>We haue receiued thy mercie, ô God, *m* in the middes of
thy temple.

<aside>*m* Grace and mercie is only granted to those that are within, or come vnto the Catholique Church.</aside>

<sup>11</sup>According to thy name ô God, so also is thy prayse vnto the
endes of the earth: thy right hand is ful of *n* iustice.

<aside>*n* As God is praised for his mercies, so also for his iustice; which do neuer preiudice the one the other.</aside>

<sup>12</sup>Let mount Sion be glad, and the daughters of Iuda reioyce,
because of thy iudgementes ô Lord
<sup>13</sup>Compasse Sion, and embrace ye her: *o* tel ye in her towers.

<aside>*o* Consider the fortresses of the Church, which are the holie Fathers, and Doctors, that watch and defend her walles.</aside>

<sup>14</sup>Set your hartes *p* on her strength: and *q* distribute ye her
houses, that you *r* may declare it in an other generation.

<aside>*p* So rest you assured for al matters of faith in this piller of truth, *q* obserue and marke dili-
gently how manie particular Churches were fredely founded in the world, *r* and declare this to
other generations, that they may also hold fast the same Faith by your example vnto it, if they be re-
lapsed; or stabil perseuere in it, if so wel they haue not.</aside>

<sup>15</sup>Because *f* this is God, our God for euer, and for euer and
euer: he shal rule vs euermore.

<aside>*f* Christ God incarnate that was borne litle in our very God and Sauiour, not for a few yeares,
an hundred, six hundred, or a thousand, but for euer and euer: *f* he shal rule as a king, and con-
sequently haue a kingdom his militant Church euermore, to the very end of this world. As he
shal likewise haue his triumphant Church in eternitie.</aside>

PSALME XLVIII.

*The royal prophet inuiting al states and sortes of men, to heare him atten-
tiuely, 6 sheweth that al ought to feare eternal damnation, that liue
wickedly, 9. vainly and foolishly seeking (13. euen like brute beastes)
carnal pleasures, which they can not long enioy, nor long escape hel. 16.
confidently animating him self, and al good men, that trust not in this
world.*

[^1]: Nothing more moueth the hart, & affecteth al the bodie and soule, then spiritual cogitations of faith and religion, and therefore it is compared to a woman traueling with child, who hath most careful and greuious panges. & In very great conflict of mans spirite, God by his grace geueth force, to breake through the contrarie assaultes of our enimie, to remoue al impedi-
ments, and to ouercrome the difficulties.

[^2]: This consideration that al is now done, that was of old prophecied, is a meruelous confirma-
tion and consolation to Christians.
