We wil confesse to thee Ã´ God: <sup>2</sup>we wil confesse, and wil inuocate thy name.

[^1] Christ with his Apostles, and other assistorie iudges, wil praise and thanke God, for his admirable good prouidence, and gouernement of this world.

[^2] This duplication of the same word, confirmeth vs of the assured performance of that, which is here prophecied.

We wil tel thy meruelouse workes: <sup>3</sup>when *I* shal take a time, I wil iudge iustices.

[^3] Christ our singular, principal, and proper Iudge only, and no mere creature, knoweth the determinate time of general iudgement.

<sup>4</sup>The earth is melted, and al that dwel in it: *I* haue confirmed the pillers thereof.

<aside>The earth at that time shal be purged with flaming fire: *f* yet shal not be destroyed, but changed in qualities.</aside>

<sup>5</sup>I said to the wicked: *g* doe not wickedly: and to them that offend: *h* Exalt not the horne.

[^4] An epitome, or briefe summe of Christs doctrine, to flee from sinne. *b* be not proud, abuse not the powre you haue, to do what you please.

<sup>6</sup>Exalt not your horne on high: speake not iniquitie against God.

<sup>7</sup>For neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the desert mountanes: <sup>8</sup>because God is Iudge.

[^5] When other iudges site on tribunals, some may be absent, or escape from their sentences: but al without exception shal be brought in person, when Christ God and Man shal iudge.

*k* This man he humbleth, and him he exalteth, <sup>9</sup>because there is a cuppe in the hand of our Lord *m* of mere wine ful of mixture.

[^6] Some shal haue sentence of eternal paine in hel, some of eternal rewarding in glorie, I though (partly in this world, partly in particular iudgement of euerie soule) God hath alreadie, and wil before the last day punish sinners, yet there resteth more punishment, and no impenitent sinners shal escape, but al shal drinke of the bitter cuppe of eternal damnation, as strong wine not delayed with water, but tempered with other sharpe thinges, as gal, vinegre, brimstone &c. and to powred into festered woundes, to they that suffer vntolerable endles paine, mixed with the worme of conscience, losse of glorie, rancor of hart, and eternal desperation.

And he hath powred it out *n* of this into that, but yet the dregges therof are not emptied: al the sinners of the earth shal drinke.

[^7] Varietie of hellish torments, from one extreme to an other: as from snowwaters to exceeding heate. Iob. 24.

<sup>10</sup>But I wil shew forth for euer: I wil sing to the God of Iacob.

<sup>11</sup>And I wilbreake al the hornes of sinners: and *o* the hornes of the iust shal be exalted.

[^8] The iust for wel vsing their powre of freewil, and of al powre geuen them in this life, are rewarded in heauen.
