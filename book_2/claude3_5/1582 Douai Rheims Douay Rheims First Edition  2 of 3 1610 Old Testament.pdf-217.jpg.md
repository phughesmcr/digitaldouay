OF PSALMES. 217

lish, which in latin are Eloquia, Sermones, we translate WORDES: only, adding in the margen, Eloquia, and Sermones, when they occurre.

Leauing therfore larger commentaries to others, we shal prosecute our wonted maner of briefe gloses. Only here premonishing the diligent readers, especially Clergimen (our felues and our brethren) who exercie dayling or read this whole Psalter in canonical houres, to obserue two particular pointes of Christian doctrine, euidently proued by manie places of this Psalme. Gods grace The one against the Pelagians heresie, denying the necessitie of Gods special necessarie in grace in meritorious workes. For the Psalmist often here inculcateth mans euerie good insufficiencie, that of himselfe, and by natural forces, he can not kepe the com worke. mandments of God, but needeth alwayes the particular grace of God, as wel to belieue in him, to craue for fauour, and to beginne good workes, as to procede, and perseuer in good liues to the end. The other against the heresie It enableth of our time, denying merite by grace of freewil. For here it is also manifest, that likewife to Gods grace maketh man able, to kepe his commandments, and by keeping merite. them to become iust in this life, and so to merite eternal glorie. Sundrie other principal Articles of Christian Catholique Religion are likewise comprised in this one Psalme: but especially Moral doctrin.

Alleluia.
Aleph.

<sup>1</sup> BLESSED *a* are *b* the immaculate in the way: which walke in the law of our Lord.

*a* Whereas al without exception, desire to be happie and blessed, *b*, they are in dede happie (according to the perfectest happines of this life) that are immaculate: *c* and they are immaculate, that walke in the law of God. Where the holic Psalmist presupposeth, that some can and do kepe the law of God, and so are immaculate, and blessed in the way of this life.

<sup>2</sup> Blessed are they, *d* that search his testimonies: that seeke him with al their hart.

*d* Those that are immaculate, are againe blessed, by searching Gods testimonies, that is, his law testifying what the good shal be rewarded, and the wicked punished, but searching these testimonies, whiles one is contaminate with sinnes against Gods law, maketh not blessed: *e* neither doth euerie superficial care search bring this blessing, but searching with true affection of the hart.

<sup>3</sup> For *f* they that worke iniquitie, haue not walked in his wayes.

*f* Contrariwise they that worke iniquitie are not blessed; *g* because they haue not walked in the wayes of God, to witte, not kept his commandments and law, which are the way to happines.

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast *h* very much commanded thy commandments to be kept.

*h* For mans owne good, that he may come to true happines, God hath most seriously commanded vs to kepe his commandments; that is, to obserue his Law commanded by most sufficiant diuine authoritie.
