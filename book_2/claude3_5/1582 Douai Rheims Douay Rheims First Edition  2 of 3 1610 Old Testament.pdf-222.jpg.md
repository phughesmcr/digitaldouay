<sup>47</sup> And I meditated in thy commandments, which I loved.

[^1] Such confessors as yet mortal, rejoyce in that they have meditated in Gods commandments, which they have fervently loved.

<sup>48</sup> And I have lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: and I was exercised in thy justifications.

[^2] Also shewed the same in external worke, not dissembling by silence, by word, nor fact.

[^3] everie way exercising Gods law, which maketh the observers just.

Zain. This.

<sup>49</sup> Be mindeful of thy word to thy servant, wherein thou hast given me hope.

[^4] That which God hath decreed, and promised, being in itself most certaine and assured, yet includeth the meanes, whereby it shal be put in execution: and therfore the just, his elect, do pray for the performance of his wil.

<sup>50</sup> This hath comforted me in my humiliation: because thy word hath quickened me.

<aside>*despe</aside>

[^5] *Expectation of thy promise hath given me corage.*

<sup>51</sup> The proud did unjustly exceedingly: but I declined not from thy law.

[^6] Prowd contemners of Gods law, have everie way molested me, by detracting, deriding, calumniating, and violently persecuting me. Al which I have borne patiently, and not declined from thy law.

<sup>52</sup> I have bene mindful of thy judgements from everlasting o Lord: and was comforted.

[^7] I remembred and considered thy just punishments inflicted upon the impious, even from the beginning of the world (both upon the divels, and wicked men) and that thou wilt exercise the like hereafter, which consideration of thy justice comforted me.

<sup>53</sup> Faynting possessed me, because of sinners forsaking thy law.

[^8] Otherwise if I had not sene thy justice, my zele against contemners of thy law, would have killed me.

<sup>54</sup> Thy justifications were songe by me, in the place of my peregrination.

[^9] In this place of my peregrination from heaven, I am comforted by remembring, celebrating, and singing thy just commandments and lawes, which do make thy servant just.

<sup>55</sup> I have bene mindful in the night of thy name o Lord: and have kept thy law.

[^10] In persecuting, and in tribulation, I kept thy law because I would not dishonour thy name.

<sup>56</sup> This was done to me: because I sought after thy justifications.

[^11] And my tribulation especially fel upon me, because I sought to be justified by keping thy law.

Heth.
