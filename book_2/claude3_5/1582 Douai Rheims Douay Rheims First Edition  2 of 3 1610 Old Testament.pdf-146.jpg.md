THE BOOKE

<sup>41</sup>And they returned, and tempted God: and the holie one of Israel they exasperated.

[^1]

<sup>42</sup>They did not remember his hand: in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of the afflicter.

<sup>43</sup>As he put his signes in Ægypt, and his wonders in the fielde of Tanis.

[^2]

<sup>44</sup>And he turned their riuers into bloude, & their showers that they might not drinke.

[^3]

<sup>45</sup>He sent vpon them a swarme of flies, and it eate them: and the frogge, and it destroyed them.

[^4][^5]

<sup>46</sup>And he gaue their fruites to the blast, and their labors to the locuste.

[^6][^7]

<sup>47</sup>And he killed their vineyardes with haile: and their mulberie trees with horefrost.

[^8][^9]

<sup>48</sup>And he deliuered their beast to haile: and their possession to fire.

[^10]

<sup>49</sup>He sent vpon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation, & wrath, and tribulation: immissions by euil angels.

[^11]

<sup>50</sup>He made a way to the path of his wrath, he spared not their liues from death: and their cattel he shut vp in death.

<sup>51</sup>And he stroke al the firstborne in the land of Ægypt: the first fruites of al their labors in the tabernacles of Cham.

[^12]

[^13]
