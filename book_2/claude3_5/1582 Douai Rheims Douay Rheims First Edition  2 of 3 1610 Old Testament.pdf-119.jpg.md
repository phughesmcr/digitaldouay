OF PSALMES. 119

ANNOTATIONS. PSALME LXIIII.

<aside>12 God wil blesse the crowne] Under the Allegorie of the land of Iurie, Perpetuitie of wherunto the people of God were to be returned, after their captivitie in the Church. Babylon, the Psalmist here prophecieth greater thinges, then can be verified of the temporal state of the Iewes, that the militant Church shal stil be blessed from the beginning to the end: yealding expected fruites; and al the iust, that perseuere to the end of their liues, shal receiue most happie and glorious Reward of the rewardes of their labours. As S. Paul after his meritorious trauels confidently iust, expected his glorious reward, when he saide (2. Tim. 4.) I haue fought a good fight, I haue consummate my course, I haue kept my faith. Concerning the rest, there is layde vp for me a Crowne of iustice, which our Lord wil render to me in that day, a iust Iudge. And not only to me: but to them also that loue his Sainctes coming. And this is called the crowne of the yeare of Gods benignitie, because crownes are God of his owne benignitie, without mans former desert geueth grace, and of Gods bein the end for merite folowing, geueth a crowne of glorie. So our Blessed nignitie. Sauiour according to his fulnes of grace, which was in his soule, and infinite merite, receiued a crowne of glorie, in the consummation of his temporal life, after the space of thirtie three yeares. And our Blessed Ladie the mother The Corones of God, receiued an vnspeakable crowne to her excellent grace and merites, of our Lord, in the consummation of her life, at the end of sixtie three yeares. In me- and our Ladie. morie of which numbers of yeares, deuout men haue piously instituted certaine formes of prayer, called the Crownes, or Coronas of our Sauiour, and of our Ladie.</aside>

PSALME LXV.

*The prophet inuiteth al men to praise God for his meruelous workes, and benefites donne to the Iewes. 7. Who being vngratefull, 8. Gentiles are called, 16. and bring forth better fruites.*[^1]

1 Vnto the end, a Canticle *a* of resurrection.

*a Mystical resurrection, Gentiles succeeding in place of the Iewes.*

2 M<sup>ake ye *b* iubilation to God al the earth</sup>, say a psalme to his name: geue glorie to his praise.

*b Shew your internal ioy by external wordes and deedes.*

3 <sup>Say ye to God: *c* How terrible are thy workes O Lord! in the multitude of thy strength thine enimies *d* shal lie to thee.</sup>

*c In destroying the wicked, in confounding the tongues in Babel, in burning Sodom and Gomorra with brimston, in plaguing the Egyptians, in drowning Pharao's and his whole armie in the read sea; in destroying the Chananites and other infidels, in punishing the tenne tribes, and afterwards the other two by captiuitie, and innumerable other punishments, al for sinnes, d for which euen the wicked, though not sincerly conuerted, yet of seruile feare, feaned and falsly promised to amend, but performed it not: as Pharao afflicted with plagues, was forced to promise libertie to the children of Israel, which he afterwards denied.*

4 <sup>Let al the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a psalme to thy name.</sup>

5 <sup>Come ye, and see the workes of God: terrible in counsels ouer the children of men.</sup>
