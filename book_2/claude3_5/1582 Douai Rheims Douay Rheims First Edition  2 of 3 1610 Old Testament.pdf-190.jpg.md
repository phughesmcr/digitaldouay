[^1]: By these principal kindes of foode, breade, wine, and oyle, al sortes of nourishment are vnderstood.

<sup>15</sup> And wine may make the hart of man ioyful: that he may make the face cheerful with oyle: and bread may confirme the hart of man.

<sup>16</sup> The trees of the fielde shal be filled, and the ceders of Libanus, which he hath planted: <sup>17</sup> there sparowes shal make their nest.

<sup>18</sup> The house of the hearne is the leader of them: the high mountaines for hartes: the rocke a refuge for the Irchins.

<sup>19</sup> He made the moone for seasons: the sunne knoweth his going downe.

<sup>20</sup> Thou didst appoint darkenes, and night was made: in it shal al the beastes of the wood passe.

<sup>21</sup> The whelpes of lions roaring, to rauen, and to seeke of God meate for themselues.

<sup>22</sup> The sunne is risen, and they are gathered together: and in their couches they shal be placed.

<sup>23</sup> Man shal goe forth to his worke: and to his working vntil euening.

[^2]: With thy creatures.

<sup>24</sup> How magnified are thy workes Ã´ Lord! thou hast made al things in wisedom: the earth is filled with thy possession.

[^3]: r fishes, ser pents, wor mes, and al liuing creatures that seeke foode.

<sup>25</sup> This great sea, and wide of spaces, there are creeping beastes, whereof there is no number.

<sup>26</sup> Litle beastes with great: there shippes shal passe.

<sup>27</sup> This dragon, whom thou madest to delude: al expect of thee that thou geue them meate in season.

<sup>28</sup> Thou geuing vnto them, they shal gather it: thou opening thy hand, al shal be filled with bountie.

<sup>29</sup> But thou turning away the face, they shal be trubled: thou shalt take away their spirite, and they shal faile, and shal returne into their dust.

<sup>30</sup> Thou shalt sendforth thy spirit, and they shal be created: and thou shalt renewe the face of the earth.

<sup>31</sup> Be the glorie of our Lord for euer: our Lord wil reioice in his workes:

<sup>32</sup> Who looketh vpon the earth, & maketh it to tremble: who toucheth the mountaines, and they smoke.

<sup>33</sup> I wil chaunte to our Lord in my life: I wil sing to my God as long as I am.

<sup>34</sup> Let my speach be acceptable to him: but I wil take delight in our Lord.
