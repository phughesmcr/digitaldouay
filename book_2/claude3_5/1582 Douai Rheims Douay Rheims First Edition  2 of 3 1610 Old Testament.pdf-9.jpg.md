VPON THE PSALMES.

application of some special part thereof in the new Testament. So it is euident *Act. 4. v. 25. c. 13. v. 33. Heb. 1. v. 5. & Heb. 5. v. 5.* that the second Psalme perteyneth to Christ, impugned and persecuted by diuers aduersaries. Which is the fift key. Thirdly, when greater thinges are affirmed of anie person, or people, as of Dauid, Salomon, Iewish nation, or the like, then can be verified of them, it must necessarily be vnderstood of Christ, or his Church, in the new Testament, or in Heauen. So the *conclusion* of the 14. Psalme: *He that doth these thinges, shal not be moued for euer*, can not be verified of the tabernacle, nor temple of the Iewes, but of eternal Beatitude in heauen. Which is the tenth key. Though the greater part of the Psalme sheweth, that iust and true dealing towards our neighbours, is necessarie for attayning of eternal Glorie. Fourtly when both the title and Psalme, or part thereof seme hard and obscure, some part being more cleare, the true sense of al may be gethered, by that which is more euident. According to S. Augustins rule, *li. 2. c. 9. & li. 3. c. 26. Doct. Christ.* So the title, and former part of the fifth Psalme, being more obscure, are explaned by the last verses, shewing plainly that God wil iustly iudge al men, both iust and wicked, in the end of this world. Which is the ninth key. By these and like meanes the principal key being found, it wil more easily appeare, what other keyes belong to the same, and what other stringes are also touched. At least the studious may by these helpes make some entrance, and for more exact knowlege search the iudgement of ancient Fathers, and other learned Doctours.

But besides this singular great commoditie, of compendious handling much Diuine matter in smal rowme, this booke hath an other special excellencie, in the kind of stile, and maner of vttering, which is Meeter, and Verse, in the original Hebrew tongue. And though in Greke, Latin, and other languages, the same could not in like forme be exactly

[^1]: Greatnes of thinges affirmed.
