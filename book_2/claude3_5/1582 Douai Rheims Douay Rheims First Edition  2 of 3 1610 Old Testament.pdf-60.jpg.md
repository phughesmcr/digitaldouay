world, were shaken and moued, at the desire of Cades, some of the Iewes also compunct in hart with remorse of conscience hearing the voice of S. Peter, and other Apostles. *The same voice of our Lord preparing hartes, inspiring the mindes of men with speede, like hyndes and does, toward the high hilles of free and perfect life, in contemplatiue vertues: as the Sauiour buildeth vpon the stone, reueiled the hidden Mysteries of the old Law, by preaching Christian doctrine, and vse of Christian Religion: *in his holie Temple, the Catholique Church, wherin al true Christians shal glorified, *a making the great abundance of people, who are like the sea when it ouerfloweth the land, to dwel in the same Church *Christ our Lord sitting, & ruling the general forever: *by his grace geuing strength to his people, to passe through the tentations of this life; *and lastly the iust with eternal peace in heauen.

PSALME. XXIX.

[^1] King Dauid by voice and instrument rendereth thankes to God for his peaceable state in the kingdom, 5. inuiteth others to reioyce in God: benefites, teaching by his owne example that God sometimes geueth more comforts sometimes sheweth his wrath, but al for our good.

<sup>1</sup> A Psalme of Canticle, *b* in the dedication of Dauids house.

[^2] Psalme common to this whole booke conteyning in al 150. is more appropriated to some, which more specially were playde vpon musical instruments: as on the Psalter, Harpe, &c. Others are called Canticles, which were sung with humane voyces. So this, called a *Psalme of Canticle*, signifieth that voyces begane the musike and instruments were adioyned. As contrariwise called *Canticles of Psalmes*, where instruments begane and voyces folowed.

[^3] After manie great tribulations, King Dauid at last possessing built an excellent house or palace. (2. Reg. 5. v. 11. Paralip. 14. v. 1.) And at his first dwelling therin, made this Psalme, beginning himselfe to the same with voice, other musicians ioyned with him in the praises of God and thankesgeuing for his benefites.

[^4] Though God in himselfe is most high, and neither needeth, nor can be exalted by men, yet the royal prophet knew it was his dutie to sing thankes and praises to him, *d* for his deliuerie from manie trubles, and dangers. *e* not suffering his enemies to be delighted in his ruine.

[^5] construed my bodie in health amidst innumerable dangers.

[^6] Preserued my soule from great danger of sinnes, and so from hel.

[^7] Ye that are iust and holie praise God for his saincts: and I confesse to the memorie of his holines.

<sup>2</sup> I wil exalte thee O Lord, *d* because thou hast receiued me: *e* neither hast delighted myne enemies ouer me.

<sup>3</sup> O Lord my God I haue cried to thee, and thou hast *f* healed me.

<sup>4</sup> Lord thou hast *g* brought forth my soule out of hel: thou hast saued me from them that goe downe into the lake.

<sup>5</sup> Sing to our Lord *h* ye his saincts: and confesse to the memorie of his holines.

*i* from whom it cometh, and not from your selues: *i* confesse his mere goodnes without your desertes.

<sup>6</sup> Because *k* wrath is in his indignation: *l* and life in his wil.
