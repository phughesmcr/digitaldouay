OF PSALMES. 251

1 Vnto *the end, a Psalme of Dauid

<aside>* By this part of the title [to the end] is signified (as is noted Psal. 4.) that the matter conteined in the Psalme, perteyneth to the new Testament.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> LORD thou *b* hast proued me, and hast knowen me:
<sup>2</sup> thou hast knowen my sitting downe, and my rising vp.

<aside>b God who seeth al thinges most absolutely and perfectly, without discourse or searching, yet, as it were, maketh experimental trial of his seruants; to make them in some sorte to know him, and to know themselues. And so here, holie Dauid or other faithful man, acknowledgeth Gods Omniscience, that is, perfect knowledge of al thinges, without exception, past, present, & to come: al workes, wordes, thoughtes, and whatsouer can be, though it neuer was nor shal be, in general and in particular.</aside>

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast vnderstood my cogitations far of: my path, and *c* my corde thou hast searched out.

<sup>4</sup> And thou hast foresene al my wayes: because there is not a word in my *d* tongue.

[^1]: The vttermost measure and reach of myne intention.

<aside>d The word holden in by the tongue, and not vttered by mouth, is not hidden from God.</aside>

<sup>5</sup> Behold o Lord thou hast knowen al the last thinges, & them of old: thou hast formed me, and hast put thy hand vpon me.

<sup>6</sup> Thy knowledge is *e* become meruelous of me: it is made strong, and I can not reach to it.

[^2]: By experience we see that Gods knowledge excedeth our reach.

<sup>7</sup> Whither shal I goe from thy spirit? and whither shal I flee from thy face?

<aside>f As Gods knowledge comprehendeth al thinges, so his presence extendeth it selfe to al places, neither is conteined in place, but excedeth al place, in his diuine immensitie.</aside>

<sup>8</sup> If I shal ascend into heauen, thou art there: if I descend into hel, thou art present.

<sup>9</sup> If I shal take my winges early, and dwel in the extreme partes of the sea:

<sup>10</sup> Certes thither also shal thy hand conduct me: and thy right hand shal hold me.

<sup>11</sup> *g* And I sayd: Perhaps darkenes shal treade ouer me: and the night is mine illumination in my delightes.

<aside>g The Prophet also by reason of experience, examineth and findeth that no darknes, nor couer can hide anie thing from God.</aside>

<sup>12</sup> For darkenes shal not be darkened from thee, and the night shal be lightened as the day: as the darkenes therof, so also the light therof.

<sup>13</sup> Because thou hast possessed *h* my reynes: thou hast receiued me from *i* my mothers wombe.

[^3]: Nothing seemeth more hidden, then a mans entrals, or a child in the mothers wombe.

<sup>14</sup> I wil confesse to thee, because thou art terribly magnified: thy workes are meruelous, & my soule knoweth exceedingly.
