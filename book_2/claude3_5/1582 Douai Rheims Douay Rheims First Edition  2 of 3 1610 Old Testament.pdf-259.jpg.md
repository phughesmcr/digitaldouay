OF PSALMES
PSALME CXLIIII

<aside>God is, and for euer ought to be praised, 3. for his immensitie, infinite, glorious Maiestie, meruelous workes; merciful benefites; for his powre, wisdom, iustice, 19. who wil reward the good, and destroy the wicked.</aside>

1 A Praysing, to Dauid himselfe.

<aside>By this title, Esdras signifieth that the Holie Ghost, who inspired al the Psalmes to Gods praise, more specially in these seuen last suggested to Dauid, and by him to al Gods seruants, that al their other seruice must tend, and be directed to the praise of God: and that therin we must continue, and finally rest, as in the seuenth day, signified (as S. Beda supposeth) by these seuen last Psalmes of praise, eternally praising our Lord God. For which principal end both Angels and Men, yea and al other creatures were made.</aside>

I <sup>1</sup> "Wil exalt thee my God O the king: and I wil blesse thy name e for euer, and d for euer and euer.

<aside>King, is the proper epitheton of Christ, the Sonne of God, to whom, in his humanitie, God the Father promised the Church of al nations for his kingdom! Psal. 2. in whom also the whole Blessed Trinitie is praised.</aside>

<sup>2</sup> Euerie day wil I blesse thee: and wil praise thy name for euer, and for euer and euer.

<sup>3</sup> Great is our Lord and exceding laudable: and of his greatnes there is no end.

<sup>4</sup> Generation and generation shal praise thy workes: and they shal pronounce thy powre.

<sup>5</sup> They shal speake the magnificence of the glorie of thy holines: and shal tel thy meruelous workes.

<sup>6</sup> And they shal tel the force of thy *e terrible thinges: and e Of wonders shal declare thy greatnes:

<sup>7</sup> They shal vtter the memorie of the abundance of thy swetnes: and in thy iustice they shal reioyce.

<sup>8</sup> Our Lord is pitiful and merciful: patient and very merciful.

<sup>9</sup> Our Lord is sweete to al: and his commiserations are ouer al his workes.[^1]

<sup>10</sup> Let al thy workes O Lord confesse to thee: and let thy saincts blesse thee.

<aside>Therfore the sanctified haue special cause to praise God.</aside>

<sup>11</sup> They shal tel the glorie of thy kingdom: and shal speake thy might.

<sup>12</sup> That they may make thy might knowne to the children of men: and the glorie of the magnificence of thy kingdom.

<sup>13</sup> Thy kingdom is a kingdom *of al worldes: and thy dominion in al generation and generation.

<aside>h Christs kingdom, the militant Church is vniuersal, but much more the triumphant which is eternal.</aside>

[^1]: The effectes of Gods mercie in redeeming, and recalling sinners, are eminent aboue al other workes.
