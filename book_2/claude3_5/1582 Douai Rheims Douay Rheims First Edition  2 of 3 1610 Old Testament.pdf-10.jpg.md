# Proemial Annotations

exactly translated yet the number, and distinction of verses is so observed, that it is apt for musike, as wel voices as instruments, and to al other uses of Gods servants. Neither is musical maner of uttering Gods word and praises, lesse to be esteemed, because profane Poetes have in this kind of stile uttered light, vaine, and false thinges. For the abuse of good thinges, doth not derogate from the goodnes therof, but rather commendeth the same, which others desire to imitate. And clere it is, that this holie Psalmodie was before anie profane poetrie now extant. For Homer the most ancient of that sorte, writte his poeme, at least two hundred and fourtie yeares after the destruction of Troy: as Apolidorus witnesseth; others, namely Solinus, Herodotus, and Cornelius Nepos say longer. Wheras king David our Divine Psalmist, reigned within one hundred years, after the Troianes warres. There were in dede Amphion, Orpheus, and Museus before David, but their verses either were not written, or shortly perished, only a confuse memorie remaining of them, recited, altered, and corrupted by word of mouth: but before them were the sacred Historie of Iob, almost al in verse; and the two Canticles of Moyses, *Exodi 15. and Deut. 32.* It is moreover recorded that even Iubal (long before Noes floud) was the father of them that sang on harpe, and organ. Musike therfore is marvelous ancient. But sacred Poetrie is in manie other respectes most excellent, and most profitable. *This holie Psalmodie* (saith *S. Augustin*) *is a medicine to old spiritual sores, it bringeth present remedie to new woundes: it maketh the good to persevere in wel doing, it cureth at once al predominating passions, which vexe mens soules. A litle after: Psalmodie driveth away evil spirits, inuiteth good Angels to helpe us, it is a shield in night terrors, a refreshing of day travels, a guard to children, an ornament to yongmen, a comforte to oldmen, a most seemlie grace to wemen. Vnto beginners it is an introduction, an augmentation to them that goe forward in vertue, a stable firmament to the perfect. It con-
