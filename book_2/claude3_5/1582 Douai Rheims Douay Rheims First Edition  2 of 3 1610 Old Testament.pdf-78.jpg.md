78 THE BOOKE

[^1] <sup>10</sup> Lord, p before thee is al my desire: and my groning is not hid from thee.

<sup>11</sup> My hart is trubled, my strength hath forsaken me: and the light of mine eies, and the same is not with me.

[^2] <sup>12</sup> My q frendes, and my neighbores haue approched, & stood against me.

[^3] <sup>13</sup> And they that were neere me, stood far of: † and they did violence which sought my soule.

And they that sought me euils, r spake vanities: and meditated guiles al the day.

[^4] <sup>14</sup> But I as s one deafe did not heare: and as one dumme not opening his mouth.

<sup>15</sup> And I became as a man not hearing: and not hauing reproofes in his mouth.

[^5] <sup>16</sup> Because t in thee ô Lord haue I hoped, thou wilt heare me ô Lord my God.

[^6] <sup>17</sup> v Because I said: Lest sometime mine enemies reioyce ouer me: and whiles my feete are moued, they speake great thinges vpon me.

<sup>18</sup> Because I w am readie for scourges: and my sorow is in my sight alwaies:

[^7] <sup>19</sup> Because x I wil declare my iniquitie: and I wil y thinke for my sinne.

<sup>20</sup> But mine enemies liue, and are confirmed ouer me: and they are multiplied that hate me vniustly.

[^8] <sup>21</sup> They that repay euil thinges for good, z detracted from me: because I folowed goodnes.

<sup>22</sup> a Forsake me not ô Lord my God, depart not from me.

<aside>p God thou knowest my desire, to be restored to thy fauour.</aside>

<aside>q those that were my frendes and companions in sinne are become myne enemies, because I forsake them:</aside>

<aside>r sought by al meanes to intangle me a gaine.</aside>

<aside>s I may not notice al sinns</aside>

<aside>t I now relie vpon thee ô God.</aside>

<aside>v for this cause I am returned to thee and do: pray that mine enemies may not preuail against me:</aside>

<aside>w I resigne my self to thee.</aside>

<aside>x though thou knowest al yet with mouth confession is made to saluation. y and I meditate of that which my sinne hath deserued.</aside>

<aside>z one kind of detraction is in reuealing secrete faultes, an other in framing and imputing false crimes, the third (s here mentioned) in calling vertues vices, as penance, hypochrisie.</aside>
