OF PSALMES. 219

<sup>14</sup> I am delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in al riches.[^1]

<sup>15</sup> I wil be exercised in thy commandmentes: and I wil consider thy waies.

<sup>16</sup> I wil meditate in thy justifications: I wil not forget thy *wordes*.

Gimel. Fulnes.

<sup>17</sup> Render *a* to thy seruant, *b* quicken me: *c* and I shal keepe thy *wordes*.[^2]

<sup>18</sup> Reuele mine eies: *e* and I shal consider the meruelous thinges of thy law.[^3]

<sup>19</sup> I am a soiourner in the land, *f* hide not thy commandmentes from me.[^4]

<sup>20</sup> My soule hath coueted to desire thy justifications, at al time.

<sup>21</sup> Thou hast *b* rebuked the prowde: *i* cursed are they that decline from thy commandmentes.[^5]

<sup>22</sup> Take from me reproch, and contempt: because I haue sought after thy testimonies.

<sup>23</sup> For *k* princes sate, and they spake against me: but *l* thy seruant was exercised in thy iustifications.[^6]

<sup>24</sup> For both *m* thy testimonies are my meditation: and *n* thy iustifications my counsel.[^7]

Daleth. Of Tables.

<sup>25</sup> My soule *a* hath cleaued to the pauement: *b* quicken me according to thy word.[^8]

[^1]: As the iust profesieth by mouth, so he delighteth in hart & practiseth in workes: & and, diligently meditateth Gods law.

[^2]: *a* O Lord liberally geue me that which I here craue. *b* quicken me with spiritual life, thy grace. *c* so I shal keepe thy law, which otherwise I can not.

[^3]: *d* Illuminate myn vnderstanding, by thy grace, *e* that I may be able to see the meruelous great and iust reasons of thy law, instructing al, threatning the peruerse, comforting the wel disposed, punishing the wicked, rewarding the good, doing right to al.

[^4]: *f* I that haue but a smal time in this world, *g* desire to be instructed in thy law, what is therein commanded.

[^5]: *h* I consider that thou Ã´ God, dost sharply reproue the prowd contemners of thy commandments: *i* laying curse vpon them for declining from thyn obedience.

[^6]: *k* Though persecuters were very potent, *l* yet the faithful seruant of God perseured in his seruice.

[^7]: *m* In time of persecution and tentation we must thincke and meditate, that Gods law resisteth eternal reward, or punishment, *n* and in our deliberation or consultation, we must consider that keping Gods law maketh iust: and consequently meriteth reward.

[^8]: *a* This also is vttered in the person of the iust, who is often brought to great distresse: as it were, euen nere to death, *b* in which case he confidently prayeth to be relieued, according to Gods word, law, and promise.
