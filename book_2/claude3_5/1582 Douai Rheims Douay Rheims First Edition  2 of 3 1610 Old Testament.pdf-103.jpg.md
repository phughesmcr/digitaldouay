OF PSALMES. 103

PSALME. LII.

<aside>The general Iudgement.</aside>

*As in the thirtenth Psalme, Christs Incarnation is prophecied, after that sinne abounded in the world: so here is foreshewed that after general wickednes, 5. Christ wil come to iudge the bad, 7. and deliuer the good. the 9. key*

Vnto the end, for *a* Maeleth, *b* vnderstandings of Dauid.

<aside>a weaknes, or mourning, b S. Augustin expoundeth this Psalme as an instruction to those that suffer persecution and iniuries, especially nere the end of the world.</aside>

<sup>1</sup>THE foole hath said in his hart: There is no God.

<sup>2</sup>They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is not that doth good.

<sup>3</sup>God hath looked forth from heauen, vpon the children of men: to see if there be that vnderstandeth, or seeketh after God.

<sup>4</sup>Al haue declined, they are become vnprofitable together: there is not that doth good, no there is not one.

<sup>5</sup>Shal they not al know that worke iniquitie, that deuoure my people as food of bread?

<sup>6</sup>God they haue not inuocated: there haue they trembled for feare, where no feare was.

Because God hath *c* dissipated the bones of them *d* that please men: they are confounded, because God hath despised them.

<aside>c God wil ouerthrow al the counfels, and forces d of worldlie politicians.</aside>

<sup>7</sup>Who wil geue out of Sion the saluation of Israel? when God shal conuert the captiuitie of his people: Iacob shal reioyce, and Israel shal be glad.

<aside>e The true Church affisteth Christ coming to deliuer the oppressed.</aside>

PSALME. LIII.

<aside>A praier in distresse. the 7. key.</aside>

*Dauid in distresse crieth to God for helpe, 6. confidently trusting therin, 8. and promising sacrifice of thankesgeuing.*

<sup>1</sup>Vnto *a* the end, *b* in songs vnderstanding for Dauid <sup>2</sup>when the Zipheites were come, and said to Saul: *c* Is not Dauid hid with vs? (*1. Reg. 1. 23. & 26.*)[^1]

<aside>a Though historically this Psalme b was song by Dauid the author therof, shewing how he prayd in danger, and rendered thankes for his deliuerie, c when vpon notice geuen that he abode in the mountaines, Saul straictly beseged him, with a great armie, but the Philistims inuading the countrie, Saul was forced to leaue Dauid, and to turne his forces against them. 1. Reg. 23. yet it perteyneth also literally to al iust men in distresse, especially to the Church of Christ, praying in like dangers, and God by his like prouidence, deliuering his seruantes in extremities.</aside>

[^1]: 1. Reg. 1. 23. & 26.
