<sup>5</sup>I wil confesse to thee / on the harpe ô God my God: why art thou sorowful ô my soule? and dost thou trubel me?

[^1] But to this purpose we praise God on the harpe, mortifying our affections.

[^2] The former word is of the plural number in hebrew, Eloim, the other of the singular, signifying the Blessed Trinitie, one God. • Thou needest not therefore my soule, be pensive, or desolate.

<sup>6</sup>Hope in God, because yet I wil confesse to him: the saluation of my countenance, and my God.

[^3] But trust in God, I praise him, whom I hope to see face to face, / the true eternal God.

PSALME. XLIII.

*The prophet describeth the first calling, and difficultie state of the Iewish nation, 6. their prosperitie at other times. 10. Againe their afflictions in captiuitie, and persecutions.*

<sup>1</sup>Vnto the end, for the sonnes of Core to vnderstanding.

[^4] Though this Psalme doth first and literally perteyne to the people of Israel, yet in figure it agreeth to the Christian Catholique Church, which begane with difficulties, afterwards prospered, and againe suffereth much persecution. • Core signifieth caluus, bald: also caluaria a skull, or place of sculles: the name of the place where our Sauiour was crucified, so the children of Core signifie the children of Christ S. Aug.

<sup>2</sup>O GOD we haue heard with our eares: our fathers haue declared to vs,

The worke, that thou hast wrought in their dayes: and in the dayes of old.

[^5] The particular calling of Abraham out of Chaldea, protection of him, and Isaac, and Iacob, the deliuerie of al Israel out of Egypt, and establishing them in the promised land of Chanaan, with innumerable, great, and strange thinges donee for them.

<sup>3</sup>Thy hand destroyed the nations, and thou didst plant them: thou didst afflict the peoples, and expel them:

<sup>4</sup>For not by their owne sword did they possesse the land, and their owne arme did not saue them:

[^6] The Israelites conquered not by ordinarie powre, but by the miraculous hand of God. See Iosue 23.

But thy right hand, and thyne arme, and the illumination of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased in them.

[^7] Not that this people deserued such fauour of themselues, for they were often wicked, he gaue peculiar grace to Abraham, Isaac, Iacob and some others, and then for their sakes protected the whole people, in them conseruing a visible Church

<sup>5</sup>Thou art the same my king and my God: which commandest the saluations of Iacob.

<sup>6</sup>In thee we shal turne out our enemies with the horne, & in thy name we shal contemne them that ryse vp against vs.

[^8] As in former examples, so in Dauids time, not mans strength, but Gods hand gaue them great victories. • As an oxe with his horne casteth a smal thing into the wind.
