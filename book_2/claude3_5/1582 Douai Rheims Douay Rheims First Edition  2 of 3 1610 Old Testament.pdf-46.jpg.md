sed counsels, which they could not establish.
Because thou shalt put them backe: in thy remnantes thou <sup>13</sup>

Be exalted Lord in thy power: / we wil chaunte and sing thy
powers.

## PSALME XXI.

<aside>Christ prayeth in his Passion, 7. describeth the acerbitie therof: 20. foresheweth his glorie, and resurrection: 23. more clerly the fundation and propagation of his Church ( 27. & 30. interpreting the singular foode of the most blessed Sacrament ) euen to the endes of the earth in al nations.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> Vnto the end " for the a morning enterprise, the Psalme b
of Dauid.

[^2]: Redemption of mankind was leraked by Christ, and performed by his death, beganne to be shewed by his
[^3]: Resurrection in the morning of the third day. a *Aug.*
[^4]: in figure of Christ the beloued of God.

[^5]: God is God of al his creatures, but in more peculiar maner of Christ by personal vnion. d Thou neither deliuerest me from dying: nor yeldest such consolation, as thou wouldest to other Sanctes.

<sup>2</sup> God c my God haue respect to me: d why hast thou forsaken me: far from my saluation are the wordes of my
sinnes.

[^6]: Mat. 27. v. 46. Mat. 27. e I am neither deliuered from dying, nor comforted in my passion, hauing
[^7]: vttered euen to dye for the sinnes of mankind, & reputed them as myne owne wordes or factes,

<sup>3</sup> My God I shal crie / by day, *and* " thou wilt not heare: and by
night, and h not for follie vnto me.

[^8]: Albeit I crie by day, & and night, on the crosse and in the garden, to haue the chalice of death remoued
[^9]: from me, and shal not be heard, h Yet there is no follie, nor fault in this petition,
[^10]: which is with submission of mans wil to Gods wil.

<sup>4</sup> But thou dwellest in the holie place, k the prayse of Israel.

[^11]: Thou from heauen wilt heare when it is conuenient. k Whose wisdome and goodnes
[^12]: the Church worthely praiseth.

<sup>5</sup> In thee / our fathers hoped: they hoped, and thou didst
deliuer them.

[^13]: Patriarkes, Prophetes, and other holie men praying in their distresses obtained their requestes.

<sup>6</sup> They cried to thee, and were m saued: they hoped in thee, and
were m not confounded.

[^14]: Were temporally deliuered by thy mightie hand from their persecuters. n not frustrate of their humble prayers.

<sup>7</sup> But I am a p worme and no man: a q reproch of men and <sup>7</sup>
outcast of the people.

[^15]: God that comforted his r seruantes in their tribulations, left Christ without his ordinarie consolation,
[^16]: to suffer more for our sinnes. p wicked persecuters respected not Christ
[^17]: as a man, but contemned him, as a very worme. q as most reprochful of al men.
