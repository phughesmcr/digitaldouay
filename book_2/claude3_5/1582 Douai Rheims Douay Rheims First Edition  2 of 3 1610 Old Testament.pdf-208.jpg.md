THE BOOKE

[^1]<sup>9</sup>NOT TO VS O LORD, NOT TO VS: but to thy name geue the glorie.

<sup>10</sup>For *thy* mercie, and *thy* truth: lest at any time *the Gentiles say: Where is their God?*

<sup>11</sup>But our God is in heauen: he hath done al thinges what soeuer he would.

<sup>12</sup>"The idols of the gentiles are siluer, and gold, the workes of mens handes.

<sup>13</sup>They haue mouth, and shal not speake: they haue eies, and shal not see.

<sup>14</sup>They haue eares, and shal not heare: they haue nostrils and shal not smel.

<sup>15</sup>They haue handes, and shal not handle: they haue feete, and shal not walke: they shal not crie in their throte.

<sup>16</sup>Let them that make them become like to them: and al that haue confidence in them.

<aside>m This is a iust prayer of the zelous, conforming their desires to Gods wil But if God geue idolaters grace to amend, then al the iust wil also reioice in their conuersion.</aside>

<sup>17</sup>The house of Israel hath hoped in our Lord: he is their helper and their protector.

<aside>n Though manie Iewes fel to idolatrie, yet there alwayes remained so manie in Gods true seruice, that it might stil be truly saide: The house of Israel hath hoped in our Lord, as is here affirmed.</aside>

<sup>18</sup>The house of Aaron hath hoped in our Lord: he is their helper and their protector.

<sup>19</sup>They that feare our Lord, haue hoped in our Lord: he is their helper and their protector.

<sup>20</sup>Our Lord hath beene mindful of vs: and hath blessed vs: He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.

<sup>21</sup>He hath blessed al, that feare our Lord, the litle with the great.

<sup>22</sup>Our Lord adde vpon you: vpon you, & vpon your children.

<sup>23</sup>Blessed be you of our Lord, which made heauen, and earth.

<sup>24</sup>The heauen of heauen is to our Lord: but *p* the earth he hath geuen to the children of men.

[^1]: Heresame Hellenists, Rabbins beginning another Psalme, but by the coherence of the matter, S. Augustin prooueth that it is but one Psalme, where it is heretofore recited: and consequently that the Gentils idoles are not goddes, because they are made of siluer, gold, or other matter, by mens handes, hauing resemblance of liuing thinges, are altogether senseles.

[^2]: This infidel worldlie politikes say in their hartes: as it were quitting their interest of heauen to God, p and contenting themselues with earthlie possessions.
