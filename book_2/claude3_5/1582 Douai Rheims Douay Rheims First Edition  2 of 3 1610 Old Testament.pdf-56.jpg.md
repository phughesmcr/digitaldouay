some frange goddes. Neuertheles his zele was such that (as he here professeth) he hated the Church of the malignant: that is, the congregations of al miscreants: & his immaculate religion was so perfect, that he would not so much as in external shew, conforme his actions to theirs, in matters of religion, nor yeld his bodilie presence in their conuenticles: but said: *With the impious I wil not sitte. Insinuating vs Christians (for the word to the end, in the title sheweth that this Psalme pertaineth also to vs) that we must both hate the Church or congregations of the malignant, to witte, of Paynims Iewes, Turkes, and Heretikes, and not sitte, nor personally be present with them in the exercise of their false pretended religions.

The Psalme of Dauid <sup>1</sup> before he was annoynted.

OVR Lord is <sup>b</sup> my illumination, and <sup>c</sup> my saluation, whom shal I feare? <sup>e</sup> against infirmitie he geueth strength. <sup>d</sup> so he feareth not mans malice, fubtiltie, nor force. *Ier. 11. v. 15.*

Our Lord is the protectour of my life, of whom shal I be afrayd?

<sup>2</sup> Whiles the harmful approch vpon me, to eate my flesh. Mine enemies that truble me, them selues are weakened and are fallen.

<sup>3</sup> If campes stand together against me, my hart shal not feare. If battel rise vp against me, in this wil I hope.

<sup>4</sup> One thing I haue asked of our Lord, this wil I seeke for, that I may dwel in the house of our Lord al the dayes of my life.

<aside>How special a benefite Da uid esteemed it to be in the Catholique Church the only true house of God!</aside>

That I may see the pleasantnes of our Lord, and visite his temple.

<sup>5</sup> Because he hath <sup>f</sup> hid me in his tabernacle: in the day of euils he hath protected me, in the secrete of his tabernacle.

<aside>Albeit the spiritual or carnal enemie seeke to ouerthrow me, yet I am secure in the Catholique Church.</aside>

<sup>g</sup> God either suffereth not the enemie to find his seruant, or not to be able to hurt him.

<sup>6</sup> In <sup>h</sup> a rocke he hath exalted me: and now he hath exalted my head ouer mine enemies.

<aside>Whether a martyr or confessour dieth, then he getteth the victorie against the persecutors.</aside>
