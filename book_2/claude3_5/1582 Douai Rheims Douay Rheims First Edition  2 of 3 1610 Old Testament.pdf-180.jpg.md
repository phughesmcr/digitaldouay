THE BOOKE

SING ye to our Lord *b* a new song: because he hath done meruelous things.

[^1]: A new benefite of grace, making men new in spirit, requireth a new songe of gratitude.

His righthand hath wrought saluation *c* to himselfe: and his arme is holie.

[^2]: Raised up himselfe from death.

<sup>2</sup>Our Lord hath *d* made knowne his saluation: in the sight of the Gentiles he hath reueled his iustice.

[^3]: Made his grace effectually knowen by raising men from sinne, and deliuering them from the power of the diuel.

<sup>3</sup>He hath remembred his mercie, and his truth to *e* the house of Israel.

[^4]: Some of the Iewes conuerted to Christianitie. *Rom. 11.*

Al the ends of the earth haue seene the saluation of our God.

<sup>4</sup>Make ye iubilation to God al the earth: *f* chaunt, and *g* reioyce, and *h* sing.

[^5]: In voice:
[^6]: In hart
[^7]: In instru-ments.

<sup>5</sup>Sing to our Lord on harpe, on harpe and voice of psalme: <sup>6</sup>on long drawen trumpets, and voice of cornet of horne.

Make iubilation in the sight of the king our Lord: <sup>7</sup>let the sea be moued, and the fulnes therof: the round world, and they that dwel therin:

<sup>8</sup>The riuers shal clappe with hand, the mountaynes together shal reioyce <sup>9</sup>at the sight of our Lord: because he cometh to iudge the earth.

[^8]: Christ directeth and disposeth al things rightly in this world.

He wil iudge the round earth in iustice, and the peoples in equitie.

[^9]: And wil accordingly geue iust sentence in the end.

PSALME XCVIII.

*Christ reigneth, notwithstanding his enemies repine, is adored (5. also his footestoole) & whom ancient Prophetes did inuocate.*

Christ our Messias, the key.

A Psalme to Dauid himselfe.

OVR Lord hath reigned, *a* let peoples be angrie: he that sitteth vpon the Cherubs, let *b* the earth be moued.

[^10]: Though manie enimies do rage, and impugne Christ: & though the whole earth be trubled therwith, yet Christ who sitteth Lord ouer the highest Angels, Cherubins and Seraphins, obteyneth the victorie, reigneth, and doth his wil in al the earth.

<sup>2</sup>Our Lord great in Sion: and high aboue al peoples.
