The receivers tooke flesh of the flesh of (the B. virgin) Marie. And because he walked here in the same flesh, and gave the very flesh to us to eate, unto salvation, and no man eateth that flesh, unless he first adore it: it is found how such a footstoole of our Lord may be adored: and not only we doe not sinne in adoring, but we should sinne in not adoring. Thus farre S. Augustin. Further instructing, not to conceive of Christs flesh, as the Capharnaites did, that he would cute it in peeces from his bodie, and geue them portions therof. His very flesh is geuen and eaten, not in fleshlie maner, but in sacramental. See Annotations. Ioan. 6.

PSALME XCIX.

[^1] One Creator of al thinges. The 1. key.

*Al are invited to reioyce in God, Creator of al.*

A Psalme <sup>a</sup> in confession.

<sup>1</sup> MAKE ye iubilation to God <sup>b</sup> al the earth: serve ye our <sup>2</sup> Lord in gladnesse.

[^2] Not only Iewes, but also al Gentiles.

Enter ye in <sup>c</sup> before his sight, in exultation.

[^3] God everywhere present, yet more peculiarly heareth his suppliants, praying in the temple, or place dedicated to his service.

<sup>3</sup> Know ye that our Lord <sup>d</sup> he is God: he made vs, and not we ourselves.

[^4] He only whom we serve as our Lord is the only God, and there is no other.

<sup>4</sup> His people, and the sheepe of his pasture: <sup>†</sup> enter ye into <sup>e</sup> his gates in confession, his courtes in hymnes: confesse ye to him.

[^5] Peculiar dedicated place, as v. 2.

<sup>5</sup> Praise ye his name: <sup>†</sup> because our Lord is sweete, his <sup>f</sup> mercie for euer, and <sup>g</sup> his truth euen vnto generation and generation.

[^6] As God is alwayes merciful in geuing, and promising: g so he is euer faithful in performing.

PSALME C.

[^7] Instruction to gouerne. the 7. key.

*King Dauid gratfully celebrateth the two general diuine vertues, Mercie and Iustice: 2. by his owne example exhorteth al, especially Superiors, to direct their wayes in sinceritie, 4. and to seperate the wicked from conuersation of the good.*

A Psalme to Dauid himselfe.

<sup>1</sup> MERCIE <sup>a</sup> and iudgement I wil sing to thee ô Lord: I <sup>2</sup> wil sing, <sup>†</sup> and I <sup>b</sup> shal vnderstand in the immaculate way, <sup>c</sup> when thou shalt come to me.

[^8] These two capital divine vertues are euer ioyned in al Gods workes, for both which experienced towards him selfe, the Psalmist rendereth thankes and praises. b I wil do myn endeauour to know the immaculate way, c which I can not do, but by thy grace coming vnto me. For by helpe therof I did as foloweth.
