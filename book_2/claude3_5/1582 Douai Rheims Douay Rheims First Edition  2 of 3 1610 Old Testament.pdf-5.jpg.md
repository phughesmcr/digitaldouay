UPON THE PSALMES.

rents, soundeth out shril, with harpe & tenne stringed psalter, rising vp from bel: so attributing the summe of this whole booke to the Royal Prophet Dauid, as if he supposed no other author.

Touching therfore the argument, or contentes of this diuine Psalter, al Catholique Doctors vniformly agree that it is the abridgement, summe, and substance of al holie Scriptures, both old and new Testament. As may first be probably collected, by that Christ himselfe often comprehending al the old Testament by the termes of the Law and Prophetes, in one place (Luc. 24. v. 44.) semeth not onlie to reduce al to *the Law and Prophetes ioyntly*, but also to *the Psalmes alone*, or seuerally.

It proposeth the law, recounteth thinges of old, prescribeth the due ordering of mens actions, and prophecieth thinges to come. Briefly it is a common treasure of good doctrine, aptly administring that is necessarie to euerie one. And a litle after, exemplifying in particular points: Is not here* (saith
