PSALME LXXV.

*The royal prophet singeth Gods praises, for his particular prouidence towards the Iewes: to further to be extended to al the meeke of the whole earth.*

<aside>Gods proui-
dence towards
his people
the Iewes.</aside>

<sup>1</sup> Vnto the end, in prayses, a Psalme a to Asaph, a Canticle to b the Assirians.

[^1]: a For the congregation of faithful and godlie people. b Amongst others, one notorious example of Gods prouidence is recorded of an hundred fourescore & fiue thousand Assirians, slaine in one night by an Angel. 4. Reg. 19.

<sup>2</sup> God is knowne c in Iewrie : in Israel his name is great.

[^2]: c God was not only knowen in general, as to pagane Philosophers, and some others, but more particularly to the Iewes, the issue of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, by his special benefites towards them.

<sup>3</sup> And d his place is made in peace : and e his habitation in Sion.

[^3]: d God suffering al other nations to erre for their sinnes, in their fond phantesies of false goddes, reserued the Israel.tes for his Church, e establishing the principalitie thereof in Sion.

<sup>4</sup> There he brake the powres of bowes, the shilde, the sword, and the battel.

[^4]: f For obtaining and conseruing of Sion from wicked Infidels, God ouerthrewe al sortes of contrarie forces.

<sup>5</sup> Thou g doest illuminate meruelously from the eternal mountaynes : <sup>6</sup> al the foolish of hart h were trubled.

[^5]: g God not only gaue his people temporal victories ouer their enemies, but also illuminated their mindes with knowlege of true religion: h where others remained in mind, hearing the truth, but are not conuerted through their obstinate follie.

<sup>7</sup> They i slept their sleepe : and al the men of riches found nothing in their handes.

[^6]: i Worldlie men in former centuries as in a sleepe, passe ouer this life, and afterwards find themselues excluded from heauen, for lacke of merites, and good workes, with the foolish virgins.

<sup>8</sup> At k thy reprehension ô God of Iacob, they l haue al slumbered that mounted on horses.

[^7]: k God vndertaking the defence of his people, and threatning the aduerse part, l they failed in courage, as men ouercome with drowsines of sleepe.

<sup>9</sup> Thou art terrible, and who shal resist thee? m from that time thy wrath.

[^8]: m Euen from the first notice of thy wil, the aduersaries were deiected, fearing thy potent wrath.
