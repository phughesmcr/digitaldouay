# OF PSALMES: I

## PSALME CXXXIX.

*The iust diuersly afflicted by the wicked, pray to be defended, 7. repose their Eternal paine confidence in God, 10. who wil aduenge the reprobate to eternal of the wicked, punishment, 13. and reward the good with the fruition of himself.*[^1]

Vnto the end, a Psalme of Dauid.

<sup>1</sup> Deliver me O Lord from the euil man: from the vniust man rescue me.

<sup>3</sup> Which haue deuised iniquities in their hart: al the day they appointed battels.

<sup>4</sup> They haue whet their tongues as that of a serpent: the venome of aspes is vnder their lippes.

<sup>5</sup> Kepe me O Lord from the hand of the sinner: and from vniust men deliuer me.

Who haue deuised to supplant my steppes: <sup>6</sup> the proude haue hid a snare for me:

And they haue stretched out ropes for a snare: they haue layd a stumbling blocke for me neere the way.

<sup>7</sup> I sayd to our Lord: Thou art my God: heare O Lord the voice of my petition.

<sup>8</sup> O Lord, Lord the strength of my saluation: thou hast ouershadowed my head in the day of battel.

<sup>9</sup> Yeld me not O Lord from my desire, to the sinner: they haue deuised against me, forsake me not, lest they perhaps be exalted.

<sup>10</sup> The head of their compasse: the labour of their lippes shal couer them.

<sup>11</sup> Coales shal fal vpon them, *m* thou shalt cast them downe: into fyre: in miseries they shal not stand vp.

<sup>12</sup> A man ful of tongue shal not be directed in the earth: euils shal take the vniust man into destruction.

<sup>13</sup> I haue knowne that our Lord wil do the iudgement of the needie: and the reuenge of the poore.

[^1]: and ioy of the elect: the 10. key.

<aside>* Yea the most quiet euil disposed men cease not to make discord, and to deuise wicked plottes and neuer cease to make mischief.</aside>

<aside>* scandalom.</aside>

<aside>* In time of tentation prayer is most necessarie.</aside>

<aside>* Man is not able to resist, vnlesse God by his grace, defend him stil from yelding consent.</aside>

<aside>* Hot tentations with swete wordes, shal ouerwhelme, and bring themselues to perdition.</aside>

<aside>* Hot fire shal be their lotte, into which they shal fal.</aside>

<aside>* Euerie one in his degree.</aside>

<aside>* I haue learned by good instruction, and by experience: that in the end God w is come forte the iust, who are now afflicted, and punish the vniust, that liue in temporal delightes, as it happened to Lazarus, and the rich glutton.</aside>
