OF PSALMES. 233

<sup>165</sup> There is much peace to them, that loue thy law: & there is no scandal to them.

<aside>Amongst other benefites, it is a special commoditie, that those which perfectly loue Gods law, haue alwayes peace in their owne conscience: and are neuer scandalized, that is, do not fall nor committe sinne, by occasion whatsoeuer geuen them by others. For it is a general assured doctrine, that the perfect are not scandalized, because they are constant in vertue, and not moued by anie example, persuasion, prouocation, or other meanes to offend God: but only the weake and vnperfect are moued, and drawne to sinne by occasions geuen them, who otherwise would not haue sinned. Neither is it excused that falleth by such occasions, because he ought to be constant.</aside>

<sup>166</sup> I expected thy saluation O Lord: and haue loued thy commandmentes.

<sup>167</sup> My soule hath kept thy testimonies: and hath loued them exceedingly.

<sup>168</sup> I haue kept thy commandmentes, and thy testimonies: because al my waies are in thy sight.

[^1]

<sup>169</sup> Let my petition approch in thy sight ô Lord: according to thy word giue me vnderstanding.

[^2]

<sup>170</sup> Let my request enter in thy sight: & according to thy word deliuer me.

[^3]

<sup>171</sup> My lippes shal vtter an hymne, when thou shalt teach me thy iustifications.

<sup>172</sup> My tongue shal pronounce thy *word*: because al thy commandmentes are equitie.

[^4]

<sup>173</sup> Let thy hand be to saue me: because I haue chosen thy commandmentes.

[^5]

<sup>174</sup> I haue coueted thy saluation ô Lord: and thy law is my meditation.

<sup>175</sup> My soule shal liue, and shal prayse thee: and thy iudgementes shal helpe me

[^6]

<sup>176</sup> I haue strayed, as a sheepe, that is lost: seeke thy seruant, because I haue not forgotten thy commandmentes.

FF

[^1]: Because whatsoeuer I do is in thy sight, whom I wil in no case offend.

[^2]: That all Gods seruants, and especially the faithful seruant of God prayeth, not for humane knowlege, or other temporal thinges: but to vnderstand Gods law.

[^3]: Thou that hast promised to heare al that inuocate thee, d vouchsafe to deliuer me in time of tribulations and tentations.

[^4]: God geuing grace, it behoueth his seruants thankfully to serue, and praise him.

[^5]: Though man be indued with grace, yet he nedeth more grace, that by Gods hand and power, not by his owne, he may resist tentations.

[^6]: By this assistance of grace, the soule continueth in spiritual life, and praiseth God.

[^7]: Al mankind, and vniuersally euerie one hath bene as a lost sheepe, and Christ came into this world to seeke and saue al: but effectually findeth and saueth those only, that forgete not to kepe his commandments.
