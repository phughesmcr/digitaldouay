<sup>2</sup>Because he hath founded it vpon the seas: and vpon the riuers hath prepared it.

[^2] <sup>3</sup>Who shal ascend into the mount of our Lord: or who shal stand in his holie place?

<sup>4</sup>The innocent of handes, and of cleane hart, that hath not taken his soule in vayne, nor sworne to his neighbour in guile.

[^3] [^4] <sup>5</sup>He shal receiue blessing of our Lord: and mercie of God his Sauiour.

[^5] <sup>6</sup>This is the generation of them that seeke him, of them that seeke the face of the God of Iacob.

<sup>7</sup>Lift vp your gates ye princes, and be ye lifted vp ô eternal gates: and the king of glorie shal enter in.

[^6] <sup>8</sup>Who is this king of glorie? Our-Lord strong & mightie our Lord mightie in battel.

[^7] <sup>9</sup>Lift vp your gates ye princes, and be ye lifted vp ô eternal gates: and the king of glorie shal enter in.

<sup>10</sup>Who is this king of glorie? The Lord of powers he is the king of glorie.
