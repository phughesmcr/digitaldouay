# ðŸ“– Digital Douay

Digitising the original 1582/1610 Douay-Rheims Bible one page at a time.

## What is this?

The Douay-Rheims Bible found in almost all forms today is Bishop Challoner's revision from 1749.

The original un-revised Douay-Rheims is hard to find, and doesn't seem to exist in a plaintext format.

This project seeks to take the three scanned PDFs of the original Douay found on archive.com and produce high-quality OCR text from them.

## How does it work?

1. First, each PDF is split into individual pages which are saved as PNG images sized correctly for the Claude 3.5 LLM and preprocessed to improve OCR accuracy. This is done using `pdf2png.ts` and then `preprocess.py`. The resulting files are stored in each book's subfolder in the `/png` directory.

2. Next, each individual image is passed to the Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM which uses it's vision capabilities to produce a markdown files of each page. This is done using `ocr_claude.ts`. The resulting files are stored in each book's subfolder in the `/claude3_5` directory.

3. [TODO]

## How to Contribute

### Support

There is a cost associated with running over 3028 pages of manuscript through the Claude API. The total API call cost is expected to be ~$55 (avg. $0.019 per page * 3028 pages). Roughly $10 was spent on R&D to get the Claude prompt right. Contributions toward this cost is appreciated through [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/phughesmcr).

### Do some manual editing

All files for hand-editing are in the `book_*/md` directories.

Do not edit files in the `/png` or `/claude3_5` directories because these are auto-generated by the various Typescript scripts.

Each markdown file represents a single page. Pick one.

If the top of the file says `manual_edit: false` then that page is in need of an edit.

Find the corresponding image in the `book_*/png` directory and us it to correct that page.

Once done, change `manual_edit: ...` to today's date in `YYYYMMDD HH:mm` format. For example `manual_edit: 20240614 12:43` - the exact hour/minute doesn't particularly matter, it's just to allow for multiple edits in the same day to be tagged properly.
